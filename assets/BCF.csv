Oh I love that Man from Galilee,

He's forgiven all my sins, 
Placed the Holy Ghost within;

The publican went to pray 
In the temple there one day,
He cried, ""O Lord

He was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this Man 
     from Galilee.""

The dumb was made to talk,
That power was spoken with 
Love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see,

The mercy of that Man 
     from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of Man 
What must he do.
These words He said to him, 
""Ye must be born again,""

From home and friends the evil

    in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness 
    stood near;
The fever raged, disease had gripped

    out every fear.

So men today have found the

Heard me when I cried;

Help me ring the Savior's praises

With her dazzle and her dreams,
Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,

Where the golden sunlight gleams,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Not for all earth's golden millions
Would I leave this precious place,
Tho' the tempter to persuade me 
     oft has tried,
For I'm safe in God's pavilion,
Happy in His love and grace,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Here the sun is always shining,
Here the sky is always bright;
'Tis no place for gloomy 
     Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music 
And my heart with great delight,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

And upon the streets of Glory, 
When we reach the other shore,
And have safely crossed the Jordan's 
     rolling tide,
You will find me shouting ""Glory"" 
Just outside my mansion door,
Where I'm living on the hallelujah side.";� Public Domain

Of our praise, of our praise

With Thine own sov'reign will Thy desires to fulfill,
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

Merits my soul's best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belongs.

And wrestled there alone until the morning light;

I want that kind of blessing.

CHORUS
I want, I want that kind of blessing.
That saves and keeps and satisfies the soul;
I want, I want that full salvation
Till billows of heaven o'er me roll.

When Israel at last came into Canaan's land,
The Lord his riches gave so full on ev'ry hand;
They drove their foes before them and dwelt a happy band,
I want that kind of blessing.

We are a chosen race, our God is drawing near;

In all of life's ebb and flow.

CHORUS
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
Sweetest name I know,
Fills my ev'ry longing,
Keeps me singing as I go.

All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
Discord filled my heart with pain,
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
Stirred the slumb'ring chords again.

Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting 'neath His shelt'ring wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing.

Tho' sometimes He leads thru' waters deep,
Trials fall across the way,
Tho' sometimes the path seems rough and steep, 
See His footprints all the way.

Soon He's coming back to welcome me
Far beyond the starry sky;
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown,
I shall reign with Him on high.";

Christ Jesus lives today!
He walks with me and talks with me 
Along life's narrow way.

Salvation to impart!
You ask me how I know He lives?
He lives within my heart.

In all the world around me
I see His loving care,
And tho' my heart grows weary I never will despair;
I know that He is leading thro' all the stormy blast,
The day of His appearing has come at last.

Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian, 
Lift up your voice and sing
Eternal hallelajahs to Jesus Christ the King!
The Hope of all who seek Him, the help of all who find,
None other is so loving, so good and kind.";c 1933 Rodeheaver Co. ICS, ARR, CCLI # 264326

Isn't He wonderful, wonderful, wonderful,
Eyes not seen, ears not heard,
What's recorded in God's Word,
Isn't He wonderful, wonderful.

There was wonderful pow'r in His Word,
For He spoke, and the sea was still.
All the halt and the blind were made whole;
Evil spirits obeyed His great will.

When He left He the comforter gave,
Ev'ry promise He made is true.
And the pow'r that was His may be ours.
""Greater works than all these His shall ye do.""

""That they all may be one,"" was His pray'r,
O, what wisdom and love sublime,
That we all may be one, let us pray.
One in spirit redeeming the time.";
882;OH I WANT TO SEE HIM;G;"As I journey thru the land

Thru' Him I must win.

O I want to see Him, look upon His face,
There to sing forever of His saving grace;
On the streets of Glory let me lift my voice;
Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.

When in service for my Lord 
  dark may be the night,
But I'll cling more close to Him, 
  He will give me light;
Satan's snares may vex my soul, 
  turn my tho'ts aside;
But my Lord goes ahead,
  leads whate'er betide.

When in valleys low I look 
  tow'rd the mountain height,
And behold my Savior there,
  leading in the fight. 
With a tender hand outstretched 
  tow'rd the valley low,
Guiding me, I can see, 
  as I onward go.

When before me billows rise 
  from the mighty deep,
Then my Lord directs my bark; 
  He doth safely keep,
And He leads me gently on 
  thru' this world below;
He's a real Friend to me, 
O I love Him so.";

Since Jesus came into my heart;
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I have ceased from my wand'ring 
  and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins which were many are 
  all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I'm possessed of a hope that is 
  steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And no dark clouds of doubt now 
  my pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

There's a light in the valley of death now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And the gates of the city beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I shall go there to dwell in that city I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I'm happy, so happy, as onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart.";c 1942 Rodeheaver Co, ICS, ARR, CCLI # 264326

When I knew Him not, He sought me,
And in love divine He ransomed me.

From the throne of heavenly glory
Oh, the sweet and blessed story!
Jesus came to lift the lost in sin and woe
Into liberty all glorious,
Trophies of His grace victorious,
Evermore rejoicing here below.

536;Just A Little Talk With Jesus;F;"I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in,
And then a little light from heaven filled 
  my soul;
It bathed my heart in love 
And wrote my   name above,
And just a little talk with Jesus made 
  me whole.

Chorus
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus,
Let us tell all about our troubles,
He will hear our faintest cry,
And He will answer by and by;
Now when you feel a little prayer 
  wheel turning
And you know a little fire is burning,
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes 
  it right.

Sometimes my path seems drear, 
Without a ray of cheer,
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the 
  light of day;
The mists of sin may rise and hide the 
  starry skies,
But just a little talk with Jesus clears 
  the way.

I may have doubts and fears,
My eyes be filled with tears,
But Jesus is a friend who watches day 
  and night;
I go to Him in prayer, 
He knows my every care,
And just a little talk with Jesus makes 
  it right.";

538;I DON'T WANT NOTHING HERE TO HINDER ME;F;"One day I heard a voice
He said ""If you'll make me your choice,
I'll drive away your every care
  and set you free.""
So I came to Him that day
And He took my sins away,
Now I don't want nothing here to 
  hinder me.

Chorus
I don't want nothing here to hinder me.
For someday His blessed face I'm 
  going to see.
It makes no difference what the cost,
Or how heavy the cross,
I don't want nothing here to hinder me.

Often times I'm tossed about.
Often times I do without.
Often times my heart is filled
  with grief and pain.
But if only I stand true
I know that He will see me through.
I don't want nothing here to hinder me.

And some day when I get home.
And my journey on earth is done.
With my Jesus and my loved ones
  I shall see
I will lay my old cross down and
   receive a shining crown,
I don't want nothing here to hinder me.";
539;DID YOU THINK TO PRAY?;F;"Ere you left your room this morning,
  Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ, our Savior,
Did you sue for loving favor,
As a shield today?

CHORUS
O how praying rests the weary!
Pray'r will change the night to day;
So, when life seems dark and dreary,
Don't forget to pray.

When you met with great temptation,
   Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit,
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As your guide and stay?

When your heart was filled with anger,
   Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who have crossed your way?

When sore trials came upon you,
   Did you think to pray?
When your soul was bowed in sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow,
At the gates of day?";
540;Ah, Lord God;D;"Ah, Lord God, 
Thou has made the heavens 
And the earth by Thy great power;
Ah, Lord God, 
Thou has made the heavens
And the earth by Thine outstretched arm.

542;FILL ME WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT;F;"I want to live each day as if the last one,
I want the truest values in my life,
For one day it will surely be my last one,
And I will have to leave this world behind.
It won't be long before the coming judgment,
And I'll appear for deeds that I have done,
And give account for idle words I've spoken,
And be judged on how I have received the Son.

Fill me with the Holy Spirit,
Fill me with eternal life,
To live each day as if it be the last one,
Far above this world with all its carnal strife.

I want to make the most of every moment,
Redeeming to the full this passing time,
By putting on His love in bowels of mercy,
And by grace, put on His humbleness of mind.
The days I've wasted are not few, but many, 
I'm praying for a difference in my life,
Till all my friends and loved ones see me changing,
Till they see no longer me, but only Christ.

Fill me with the Holy Spirit
My prayer is please don't pass me by.
Till faith o'er takes this weary pilgrim,
And I set my wings and like an eagle fly.";
543;IN HIM;F;"I know that I am nothing
To bear the Christian name.
For every blunder that I make
I've just myself to blame.
Glory, Hallelujah! 
I don't see them at all
And neither does my Saviour, 
For the blood Has cleansed them all.

Chorus
In Him, In Him,
Is the only place for me
I won't go back for anything,
To where I used to be.
The Son is always shining,
And the victory's been won;
And I'm walking in the Light
Of that New Jerusalem.

Why do you talk of sorrow, 
For there is none in here;
In Christ is no unhappiness;
In Christ there is no fear.
It doesn't seem to matter 
How dark it is outside
For in His shekinah glory, 
A soul is free to hide.

It doesn't seem to matter
How this old flesh may feel.
Let every man's word be a lie,
God's Word alone is real.
Oh, how my heart's rejoicing:
It's all in Him, not me.
And the glory is to Him alone,
Throughout eternity.";

Everything to me.

I will bow myself down,
Humbly at Your throne.

I will give everything, 
To You alone.

885;I KNOW WHO HOLDS TOMORROW;Bb;"I don't know about tomorrow,
I just live from day to day.
I don't borrow from its sunshine,
For its skies may turn to gray.
I don't worry o'er the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
And today I'll walk beside Him,
For He knows what is ahead.

CHORUS
Many things about tomorrow.
I don't seem to understand;
But I know who holds tomorrow,
And I know who holds my hand.

Ev'ry step is getting brighter,
As the golden stairs I climb;
Ev'ry burden's getting lighter;
Ev'ry cloud is silver lined.
There the sun is always shining.
There no tear will dim the eye,
At the ending of the rainbow,
Where the mountains touch the sky.

I don't know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty;
But the one who feeds the sparrow, 
Is the one who stands by me.
And the path that be my portion,
May be through the flame or flood,
But His presence goes before me,
And I'm covered with His blood.";c 1950 by Ira Stanphill
886;ETERNAL REST;C;"Time's clock is striking the hour,

Glory and praise to God.

Rest in the spirit know;
Sorrow forever departed,
Gladness shall overflow.

Sighing forever is ended,
Foes shall oppress no more;

To Him whom all adore.

Sealed for eternity,
Praise to the Lamb we will render
Worthy of praise is He.

Crowns of eternal life.";

CHORUS
We'll talk it over in the bye and bye,
We'll talk it over, my Lord and I,
I'll ask the reasons He'll tell me why,
When we talk it over in the bye and bye.

I'll trust His leading, He'll never fail,
Thro' darkest tunnels or misty vale;
Obey His bidding and faithful be,
Tho' only one step ahead I see.

I'll hide my heartache behind a smile
And wait for reasons till after while;
And 'tho He try me I know I'll find,
That all my burdens are silver lined.";

Doubts and fears assail;
One still loves and cares for you:
One who will not fail.

Heav'n and earth  may pass away
But Jesus never fails.

Tho' the sky be dark and drear,
Fierce and strong the gale,

I'm going thro', I'm going thro',
I'll pay the price, whatever others do;
I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few;
I'm going thro', Jesus, I'm going thro'.

Many once started to run in the race,
But with our Redeemer they could not keep pace;
Others accepted because it was new,
But not very many seem bound to go thro'.

Let me but follow my Lord all alone
And have for my pillow, like Jacob, a stone,
Rather than vain wordly pleasures pursue,
Than in with your Savior, and keep going thro'.

Come then, my comrades, and walk in the way
That leads to the kingdom of unending day;
Turn from your idols and join with the few,
Start in with your Savior, and keep going thro'.";

Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.";

Have you left this old world far behind;

Gone back, and you seem all alone?
Keep your eyes on the prize, 
For the home in the skies,

And burdens distress us,
He never will leave us alone;
God is still on the throne, 
He never forsaketh His own;
His promise is true,
He will not forget you,
God is still on the throne.

Burdened soul, is your heart growing wary
With the toil and the heat of the day;
Does it seem that your path is more thorny,
As you journey along on life's way?
Go away and in secret before Him
Tell your grief to the Saviour alone;
He will lighten your care,
For He still answers pray'r.
God is still on the throne.

You may live in a tent or a cottage,
Unnoticed by those who pass by;
But a mansion for you He is building
In that beautiful city on high;
It will outshine the wealth and the splendor
Of the richest on earth we have known;
He's the Architect true, 
And He's building for you; 
God is still on the throne.

He is coming again, is the promise
To disciples when He went away;
In like manner as He has gone from you,
You will see Him returning some day;
Does His tarrying cause you to wonder,
Does it seem He's forgotten His own?
His promise is true,
He is coming for you;
God is still on the throne.";

When He died on the cross,
To redeem all the lost;
He prepared the road that leads to His abode,
'Tis a road marked by blood
But it leads us home to God.

And the way is marked by the footprints of the Savior, 
With His blood He made it, made it plain and straight;
If you walk that way it will lead you into heaven,
Lead you safely into glory's golden gate.

Walk the bloody pathway that the Savior trod;
Then when life is over and all the sheaves are garnered,
You will meet the Savior and be not afraid.";

As gems in His crown to shine.

Since Jesus has set me free,

No longer I bear
   the burden of care,
His yoke is so sweet to me.
My soul was as black as night,
But darkness has taken flight;
Now I shout the victory,
For Jesus has set me free.

I look on the great white throne,
Before it the ransom'd stand;
No longer are tears,
   no sorrow is known
Nor death in that goodly land.
My Savior has gone before,
Preparing the way for me;
Soon we'll meet to part no more
Thru time or eternity.

The gates of that holy place
Stand open by night and day;

Hide Thou me.

Chorus
O Rock of Ages, hide Thou me,
No other Refuge, have I but Thee,
When life's dark vale I wander,
Far, far from Thee;
Then, I cry, O Rock of Ages, 
Hide Thou me.

Sometimes it seems I dare not go
   one step farther on,
And from my heart all courage
   has slipped away and gone;
But, I remember Jesus,
   and all His love for me,
Then, I cry, O Rock of Ages,
Hide Thou me.

O what a Friend is Jesus,

He was wounded for
   our transgressions,
He was bruised for 
   our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes 
   we are healed.

Price for healing was paid,
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgment hall.
Now His suff'ring affords perfect
   healing for all.
This wonderful Healer's mine.

Came the leper to Christ, saying,
""Surely I know, that Thou,
Lord, canst make me whole.""
When His great faith was seen
Jesus said, ""Yes, I will.""
And touch'd him and
   made him clean.

Here we have our days of sunshine,

When He reach'd down

I was lost and undone,

When He reach'd down
   His hand for me, for me.

I was nearing despair, 
When He came to me there,
And He showed me 
   that I could be free;
Then He lifted my feet,
   gave me glory complete,
When He reach'd down 
   His hand for me, for me.

How my heart doth rejoice 
   since I made Him my choice,
From the tempest to
   Him now I flee;
Now I lean on His arm, 
I'm secure from all harm. 
Since He reach'd down 
   His hand for me, for me.

Since the Lord gave me peace

Grant with Thee I may stand.

His heart was broken on Calvary;
His hands were nailscarred, 
His side was riven, 
He gave His lifeblood for even me.

He left the Father, with all His riches, 
With calmness sweet and serene,
Came down from heaven and 
  gave His lifeblood,
To make the vilest sinner clean.

Come and heal my broken spirit.""

May some of our bindings need mending,

May Revelation have more color than red, black, and   white.
May Genesis' pages fall out.
May our Bibles have more words than are printed
As our reading the Word makes us shout!

May our voices be lost -- at least raspy,
Resorting to whispers we sigh.

When we think back remembering why.

To make hearing the Message our choice.

And their beauty is all but forgot

So Great is the Weight of Thy Presence!
And the altar worn bare despite al its care
Stained with tears and shook loose from repentance!

May we be found kneeling or prostrate
Even after a long day of work;
And we raise up our arms though they're weary
To keep worshipping You when it hurts.

A step closer to Your Holy Fire!

Where The Shadows Fall The Deepest

Down Where The Longhorns Graze.
But Somewhere Up The Canyon, I Can Hear The Lion's Whine,
In The Far Off Catalina Mountains, On The Arizona Line.

He Wrote The Poem You Have Just Heard
On A Borrowed Sheet Of Paper

And Even Though He Has Never Seen The Catalina Mountains
He Was Lonesome For Them
Many Years Later His Inspiration Became A Reality
And He Sat Right There In The Canyon
With The Lion Looking In His Face
 And Said When I Was Older Than Twelve Years Old,
I Longed For A Land I've Never Seen Before 
And Someday Soon, I Am Going To Step Out Of This Body
Into A Brand New Body Called My Theophony

I Am Lonesome, Oh, So Lonesome,
For That Far Away Southwest,
Where The Shadows Fall The Deepest
Over The Mountain Chest;
I Can See The Lurking Coyotes
All Around The Purple Haze;
And Can Hear The Lobos Hollering
Down Where The Longhorns Graze.
But Somewhere Up The Canyon, I Can Hear The Lion's Whine,
In The Far Off Catalina Mountains, On The Arizona Line.";
