6;The Water Way;Eb / F;"Long ago the maids drew water
In the evening time, they say.
One day Isaac sent his servant
To stop Rebekah on her way.
""My master sent me here to tell thee;
See these jewels rich and rare;
Would'st thou not his lovely bride be
In that country over there?""

Chorus
It shall be light in the evening time,
The path to glory you will surely find;
Through the water way, It is the light today,
Buried in the precious Name of Jesus.
Young and old, repent of all your sin,
The Holy Ghost will surely enter in;
The evening Light has come,
It is a fact that God and Christ are one.

So God's servant come to tell you
Of a Bridegroom in the sky,
Looking for a holy people.
To be His Bride soon, by and by;
He sends to us refreshing water
In this wondrous latter day;
they who really will be raptured
Must go through the water way

Are you on your way to ruin,
Cumbered with a load of care?
See the quick work God is doing
That so His glory you may share.
At last the faith He once delivered
To the saints is ours today;
To get in the Church triumphant 
You must go the water way.

have you looked and often wondered
Why the power is slack today?
Will you stay in the back number
And go on in the man-made way?
O saints who never have been buried
In the blessed name of God,
Let the truth now sanctify you;
It's the way apostles trod";© Public Domain

10;Got Any Rivers?;F;"Be of good courage, 
God spake unto Joshua
When over the river 
God pointed the way
Jordan uncrossable! 
things seemed impossible
Waters divide 
as they march and obey

Chorus
Got any rivers you 
think are uncrossable?
Got any mountains you 
can't tunnel through?
God specializes in things
thought impossible,
And He will do what
no other power can do.

Battles to win! they would
meet with their obstacles
Jericho's walls, too, 
must fall to the ground.
God never failed; 
He stood back of His promises,
Walls had to crumble 
as they marched around.

God is the same and 
His Word is dependable
He'll make a way 
through the waters for you;
Life's situations by
Him are amendable,
Mountains and hills 
He will part for you too.";© Public Domain

And that's why I'm happy tonight.

The Lord God sent us a prophet
According to Malachi 4 
To turn the hearts of the childen 
Back to the fathers
The message was sent to restore
We are living now in the end time
The bride is preparing today
The bridegroom has sent us His message
That he'd soon take his bride away

What is the attraction on mount
The Pillar of Fire has come
Spiritual food in due season
No need to starve anymore

The mysteries have been revealed
The revelation of the seven seals 
Has been opened
And the bridegroom is ready to leave";© Public Domain

To prepare a Bride
To walk with Him and talk with Him

And to take us out of here.

Chorus

Overcoming power 
To keep the devil away.

'Till we become the Word.

This sinful earth
To go and meet the Lord.

We have passed the seventh age,
the Power has to come
The scientists have gone to work,
They are sure to get the job done.
Our sins and weights to lay aside
And to set everything right
So when the inspiration falls,
We'll just take off in flight.

Our Moses has already gone,
He has prepared the way.
He brought us to Jordan
And was taken away
But Joshua is preparing now
To sound out His Command
To gather all the Saints of God
To enter the promised Land";© Public Domain
