And the world can't take it away."
191;My Soul Doth Magnify;Eb;"My soul doth magnify the Lord,
My soul doth magnify the Lord,
And my spirit hath rejoiced in
     God my Saviour;
For He that is mighty
Hath done great things,
And Holy is His Name."

All hail Emmanuel.
King of Kings, Lord of Lords,
Bright morning star.

194;The Trumpet Shall Sound;Eb;"Rapturing Faith 
Is the hunger of my soul today.
Rapturing Grace,
To be changed and taken away.

CHORUS
And the trumpet shall sound
And the dead shall rise,
And our Lord will be waiting 
   in the skies.
And we who remain, 
   shall be changed
In the twinkling of an eye.

Right now we are groaning,
The whole creation is moaning,
Waiting on our Lord
To claim what He has restored;
We are His purchased possession
By His Blood of redemption.
We are a new creation
Through His divine revelation.

I know it is hard,
But saints I know it ain't so bad,
There're many worse than me and you,
And they don't even know what to do.
But it's not so in our case,
For we have Rapturing Grace,
Jesus has gone to prepare a place,
We are the winners in this race.

Glory, Glory, Glory! 
Hallelujah to His name!	
Yesterday, today  and forever,
Our Jesus is the same."

'Tis better far I know.
So let Him bid me go or stay."
197;After All;C;"After all this life is over

All things are possible, only believe;
Only believe, only believe,
All things are possible, only believe.

     (Lord, I receive...)
     (Jesus is here...)

Fear not, little flock, 
He goeth ahead,
Your shepherd selecteth 
The path you must tread;
The waters of Marah 
He'll sweeten for thee,
He drank all the bitter 
     in Gethsemane.

Fear not, little flock, 
What ever your lot,
He enters all rooms,
""The doors being shut;""
He never forsakes, 
He never is gone,
So count on His presence 
In darkness and dawn."

Living by faith, in Jesus above,
Trusting, confiding in 
His great love;
From all harm safe 
In His sheltering arm.
I'm living by faith 
And I feel no alarm.

Though tempest may blow 
And the stormclouds arise,
Obscuring the brightness of life,
I'm never alarmed 
At the overcast skies,
The Master looks on at the strife.

I know that He safely 
     will carry me through,
No matter what evils betide,
Why should I then care, 
Though the tempest may blow,
If Jesus walks close to my side.

Our Lord will return to this 
     earth some  sweet day,
Our troubles will then all be o'er.
The Master so gently 
Will lead us away,
Beyond that blest heavenly shore."

For an answer from You.

They that wait upon the Lord,
Shall renew their strength,
They shall mount up with wings 
     as eagles,
They shall run and not be weary, 
They shall walk and not faint;

Teach me, Lord, to wait.

Teach me, Lord, to wait 
While hearts are aflame,
Help me humble my pride 
And call on Your Name;
Keep my faith renewed, 
Keep my eyes on Thee,
Help me be on this earth 
What You want me to be."

Grace that will pardon 
And cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater 
Than all our sin.

Sin and despair 
Like the sea waves cold, 
Threaten the soul 
With infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, 
Yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge, 
The Mighty Cross.

Dark is the stain 
That we cannot hide,
What can avail 
To wash it away?
Look! there is flowing 
A crimson tide;
Whiter than snow 
You may be today.

Marvelous, infinite, 
Matchless grace,
Freely bestowed 
On all who believe!
You that are longing 
To see His face,
Will you this moment 
His grace receive?"

Are gathering in,
Washed like snow, 
And free from all sin;
How we'll shout, 
And how we'll sing,
When the redeemed 
Are gathering in.

There will be a great procession 
Over on the streets of gold,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Oh what music, Oh what singing, 
O'er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption's story 
With their voices clear and strong,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Then the angels all will listen, 
For they cannot join that song,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Then the Saviour will give orders 
To prepare the banquet board,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
And we'll hear His invitation, 
""Come, ye blessed of the Lord,""
When the redeemed are gathering in."

Some golden daybreak, 
Battles all won,
He'll shout the victory, 
Break through the blue,
Some golden daybreak, 
For me, for you.

Sad hearts will gladden, 
All shall be bright,
Good-bye forever 
To earth's dark night;
Changed in a moment, 
Like Him to be,
Oh, glorious daybreak, 
Jesus I'll see.

Oh, what a meeting, 
There in the skies,
No tears nor crying 
Shall dim our eyes;
Loved ones united 
Eternally,
Oh, what a daybreak 
That morn will be."

I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in mine ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Jesus,
Oh how I love Jesus,
Oh how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.

It tells me of a Savior's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood;
The sinner's perfect plea.

It tells me what my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part,
That none can bear below.

To me, You are so wonderful,
To me, You are so wonderful,
To me, You are so wonderful,
Because You first loved me."

Fill my way every day with love,
As I walk with the heavenly Dove;
Let me go all the while, with 
     a song and a smile,
Fill my way every day with love.

Keep me close to the side of 
     my Saviour and Guide,
Let me never in darkness rove;
Keep my path free from wrath, 
    and my soul satisfied,
Fill my way every day with love.

Soon the race will be o'er, and 
     I'll travel no more,
But abide in my home above;
Let me sing, blessed King, 
     all the way to the shore,
Fill my way every day with love."
212;I Love Him;C;"Gone from my heart the world
     and all its charms;
Now, through the blood, 
     I'm saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart 
     is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus 
     cleans white as snow.

CHORUS
I love Him, I love Him
Because He first loved me
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary's tree.

Once I was lost, and 'way 
     down deep in sin,
Once was a slave to passions 
     fierce within;
Once was afraid to 
     trust a loving God;
But now I'm cleansed from every 
     stain through Jesus' blood.

Once I was bound, 
     but now I am set free;
Once, I was blind, but now 
     the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now 
     in Christ I live,
To tell the world around 
     the peace that He doth give."
213;Zion's Hill;F;"There waits for me 
     a glad tomorrow,
Where gates of pearl swing 
     open wide,
And when I've passed this 
     vale of sorrow,
I'll camp upon the other side.

CHORUS
Some day beyond the reach 
     of mortal ken,
Some day, God only knows 
Just where and when,
The wheels of mortal life 
Shall all stand still,
And I shall go to dwell 
     on Zion's hill.

Some day I'll hear the 
     angels singing,
Beyond the shadows 
     of the tomb;
And all the bells of 
     heaven ringing,
While saints are singing, 
""Home, Sweet Home.""

Some day my labors will 
     be ended,
And all my wand'rings 
     will be o'er,
And all earth's broken ties 
     be mended,
And I shall sigh and weep 
     no more.

Some day the dark clouds 
     will be rifted,
And all the night of gloom 
     be past;
And all life's burdens 
     will be lifted,
The day of rest shall 
     dawn at last."

I shall not be moved;
In His love and favour,

     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

CHORUS
I shall not be, 
I shall not be moved,
I shall not be, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In my Christ abiding, 
I shall not be moved;
In His love I'm hiding, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

If I trust Him ever, 
I shall not be moved:
He will fail me never, 
I shall not be moved;

On His word I'm feeding, 
I shall not be moved,
He's the One that's leading, 
I shall not be moved,
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Glory hallelujah, 
I shall not be moved;
Anchored in Jehovah, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by 
     the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In His love abiding, 
I shall not be moved;
And in Him confiding, 
I shall not be moved:
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though all hell assail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Jesus will not fail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though the tempest rages, 
I shall not be moved,
On the Rock of Ages, 
I shall not be moved;

Its glittering towers 
     the sun outshine,
I feel like traveling on;
That heavenly mansion 
     shall be mine,
I feel like traveling on.

Let others seek a home below,
I feel like traveling on;
Which flames devour, 
Or waves o'er flow,
I feel like traveling on.

The Lord has been so 
     good to me,
I feel like traveling on;
Until that blessed home I see,
I feel like traveling on."
216;I Am Marked;Ab;"I have lost my reputation 
Since I turned my back on sin,
And a lot of friends went from me 
Since I let my Saviour in;
Now they pass me by unknown, 
When they once passed with a smile;
Now they say I'm very foolish, 
And they say I'm out of style.

CHORUS
I am marked, marked, marked,
I am marked, now wherever I go;
I am marked, marked, marked,
Just what I am everyone seems to know.
I am sealed, sealed, sealed,
I am sealed by His Spirit Divine;
Oh glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen!
I am His and I know that He is mine.

Well, they say my life is ruined, 
And my talent thrown away,
And they cannot understand it, 
For I had such plans one day;
But I know what I surrendered 
When I promised I'd go through;
And I gained far more glory 
Since God made me over new."
217;Wings Of A Dove;C;"Noah had drifted
On the floods many days
He searched for land
In various ways
Troubles he had some,

God gave him His sign
On the wings of a dove.

CHORUS
On the wings of a snow-white dove,
God sends His pure, sweet love,
A sign from above, 
On the wings of a dove.

Jesus, our Saviour
Came to earth one day;
He was born in a stable,
In a manger of hay;
Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign,
On the wings of a dove.

Though I have suffered
In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;
Faith wasn't forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign
On the wings of a dove."
218;Beyond The Sunset;Db;"Beyond the sunset, 
Oh blissful morning,
When with our Saviour 
Heaven is begun.

No clouds will gather,
No storms will threaten, 
No fears annoy.
Oh day of gladness, 
Oh day unending;
Beyond the sunset, eternal joy.

Beyond the sunset, 
A hand will guide me
To God, the Father, 
Whom I adore;
His glorious presence, 
His words of welcome,
Will be my portion 
On that fair shore.

Beyond the sunset, 
Oh glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones 
Who've gone before.
In that fair homeland 
We'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset forevermore."

The beautiful, the beautiful river;
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows from the throne of God.

On the bosom of the river,
Where the Saviour-King we own,
We shall meet and sorrow never,
'Neath the glory of the throne.

On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy, golden day.

Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

At the smiling of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour's face,
Saints whom death will never sever
Lift their songs of saving grace.

Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace."
220;Must Jesus Bear Alone?;G;"Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for every one,
And there's a cross for me.

Till death shall set me free,
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there's a crown for me.

Upon the crystal pavement, down
At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,.
And His dear name repeat.

Oh precious cross! Oh glorious crown!
Oh resurrection day!
Ye angels from the stars come down
And bear my soul away."

Having no burdens to bear?
Joyously singing 
With heart-bells all ringing,
Oh won't it be wonderful there?

Walking and talking with Christ, 
     the supernal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Praising adoring the matchless 
     eternal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?

There where the tempest 
Will never be sweeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Sure that forever the Lord 
     will be  keeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?"
222;When I Reach That City;F;"On the top of Mount Zion is a city
And the earth with glory it doth fill;

Oh, that city on Mount Zion,
Tho' a pilgrim, yet I love thee still;
I'll not leave thee, through the ages,
When I reach that city on the hill.

I'm invited to come home to that city,
For the Word says, ""Whosoever will,""
And I'll find there a mansion for me
     waiting
When I reach that city on the hill.

Death will never molest me in that city,
Never leave me lying cold and chill;
And I'll enter to live up there forever
When I reach that city on the hill.

So I'll stay here until my Saviour 
     calls me,
Trying daily to perform His will;
Then He'll say unto me, ""Well done,""
     up yonder
When I reach that city on the hill."

Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He sayeth, 
     do what He willeth,

Leaving the paths of sin;
Friends may oppose me,

Come, friends, without delay,
Taught by the Bible, led by the Spirit,
We'll walk the heavenly way."

Ready my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes, illumine me,

And while the wave-notes 
Fall on my ear,
Everything false 
Will disappear,

Open my mouth,

Gladly the warm 
Truth everywhere;
Open my heart, 
And let me prepare,
Love with Thy children 
Thus to share."
226;The Love Of God;C;"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;

His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

CHORUS
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints and angels song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God's love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race,
The saints and angels' song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."
227;The Meeting In The Air;Bb;"You have heard of little Moses in the bulrush,
You have heard of fearless David and his sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming 
     Joseph,
And of Jonah and the whale you often sing.
There are many, many others through the Bible,
I should like to meet them all, I do declare!
By and by the Lord will surely let us meet them,
At the meeting in the air.

CHORUS
There is going to be a meeting in the air.
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you, meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky;
Such singing you will hear, 
Never heard by mortal ear,
'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son will be the leading One
At the meeting in the air.

Many things will there be missing 
In that meeting:
For the mourners bench 
Will have no place at all;
There will never be a sermon 
Preached to sinners,
For the sinner had refused to heed the call.
There will be no mourning 
Over wayward loved ones,
There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer;
All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted
At that meeting in the air.

There the doubters will be missing altogether,
All the skeptics will be absent on that day;
There will be no grumblers present to disturb us,
And the Achans will be busy far away.
There the saints will have His 
     ""seal upon their foreheads,""
Dressed in raiment none 
But ransomed ones can wear;
All who have the wedding garments 
     will be present, 
At the meeting in the air."
228;The Old Time Religion;G;"It's the old-time Holy Spirit,
And the devil won't go near It,
That's the reason people fear It;
But it's good enough for me.

CHORUS
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
It's good enough for me.

It will make you stop your lying;
It will save you when you're dying;
It will start the devil flying;
And It's good enough for me.

It's so good I want no other,
For It makes me love my brother;
And It brings things from under 
     cover,
And It's good enough for me."
229;Jesus, The Light;Eb;"All ye saints of light proclaim,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Life and mercy in His name,
Jesus, the light of the world.

CHORUS
We'll walk in the light, 
    the beautiful light,
Come where the dewdrops 
    of mercy are bright;
Shine all around us 
    by day and by night,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Hear the Saviour's earnest call,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Send the Gospel truth to all,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Why not seek Him then today,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Go with truth the narrow way,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Come, confess Him as your King, 
Jesus, the light of the world;
Then the bells of heaven will ring,
Jesus, the light of the world."
230;It's Dripping With Blood;Eb;"The first one to die for 
This Holy Ghost plan,
Was John the Baptist, 
But he died like a man;
Then came the Lord Jesus, 
They crucified Him,
He taught that the Spirit 
Would save men from sin.

CHORUS
It's dripping with blood, Yes, 
It's dripping with blood,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood,
The blood of disciples 
Who died for the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, 
And John the divine,
They gave up their lives so 
This Gospel could shine;
They mingled their blood, 
Like the prophets of old,
So the true Word of God 
Could honest be told.

Then they stoned Stephen, 
He preached against sin,
He made them so angry, 
They dashed his head in;
But he died in the Spirit, 
And gave up the ghost,
And went to join others, 
In that life-giving host.

There's souls under the altar, 
Crying, ""How long?""
For the Lord to punish 
Those who've done wrong;
But there's going to be more 
Who'll give their life's blood
For this Holy Ghost Gospel 
And its crimson flood."
231;Have Thine Own Way, Lord;Eb;"Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Thou are the Potter;
I am the clay.
Mould me and make me
After Thy will,
While I am waiting, 
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me,
Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in thy presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray!
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o'er my being
Absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me."
232;The Homecoming Week;F;"Upon our journey here below 
     we meet with pain and loss;
Sometimes there is a crown of thorns,
     sometimes the heavy cross.
The dreary road to Calvary,
     the bitter goad and sting,
But what's inside those gates of pearl
     will be worth everything.

CHORUS
When we're inside the gates of pearl,
We'll learn a lot of things,
We'll have a harp that's made of gold,
Perhaps a thousand strings;
We'll sing and shout and dance about,
The Lamb will dry our tears;
We'll have a grand homecoming week,
The first ten thousand years.

The shadows now begin to fall,
     the time is drawing nigh,
When Christ our Lord shall come again
     like lightning from the sky.
And while we wait and suffer here, 
     praise God, we'll shout and sing,
For one glimpse through those gates
     of pearl will be worth everything.

The precious blood of God's own Son
     has saved and sanctified
A wondrous people for His name 
     and they are called the Bride.
Though here neglected and despised,
     one day the Lord will bring
His chosen ones within the gates,
     and that's worth everything."
233;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot;F;"I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home;
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

CHORUS
Swing low, sweet chariot, 
Coming for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do,
Coming for to carry me home;
Tell all my friends I'm a-coming too,
Coming for to carry me home."
234;Peace In The Valley;C;"Well, I'm tired and so weary, 
But I must go along;
Till the Lord comes and calls 
Me away, oh, yes;
Well the morning is bright 
And the Lamb is the Light;
And the night, night is as fair 
As the day, oh yes.

CHORUS
There will be peace in the valley 
For me some day;
There will be peace in the valley 
For me, oh, Lord, I pray;
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow,
     no trouble I'll see;
There will be peace 
In the valley for me.

There the flow'rs will be blooming, 
And the grass will be green;
And the skies will be clear 
And serene, oh, yes;
Well the sun ever beams, 
In this valley of dreams;
And no clouds there will ever 
Be seen,oh, yes.

Well, the bear will be gentle, 
And the wolf will be tame;
And the lion shall lay down 
By the lamb, oh, yes;
Well the beast from the wild, 
Shall be led by a little child;
And I'll be changed, changed 
From this creature that I am, oh, yes."
235;Wonderful;F;"Oh my heart sings today, 
Sings for joy and gladness,
Jesus saves, satisfies, 
Banishes my sadness;
Guilt is gone, peace is mine, 
Peace like to a river,
Jesus is wonderful, 
Mighty to deliver.

CHORUS
Wonderful, wonderful, 
Jesus is to me,
Counselor, Prince of Peace, 
Mighty God is He;
Saving me, keeping me 
From all sin and shame,
Wonderful is my Redeemer, 
Praise His name!

Once a slave, now I'm free, 
Free from condemnation,
Jesus gives liberty 
And a full salvation;
Now the sins of the past 
Have been all forgiven,
And my name is inscribed 
On the book of heaven.

Living here with my Lord 
In a holy union,
Day by day, all the way 
Holding sweet communion;
Oh what change grace hath wrought 
In my lowly station!
Since my soul has received 
Full and free salvation."
236;I'll Be Listening;F;"When the Saviour calls I will answer,
When He calls for me I will hear;
When the Saviour calls I will answer,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

CHORUS
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name;
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

If my heart is right when He calls me,
If my heart is right I will hear;
If my heart is right when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

If my robe is white when He calls me,
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name."
237;Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus;F;"O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free!

CHORUS
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion,
For more than conqu'rors we are!

His Word shall not fail you, 
     He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well;
Then go to a world that is dying, 
His perfect salvation to tell!"
238;A Child Of The King;Eb;"My Father is rich in 
     houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of 
      the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, 
      of silver and gold
His coffers are full, 
     He has riches untold.

CHORUS
I'm a child of the King!
A child of the King!
With Jesus my Saviour,
I'm a child of the King!

My Father's own Son, 
      the Saviour of men,
Once wandered o'er earth 
     as the poorest of  them;
But now He is reigning 
     forever on high,
And will give me a home 
     in heav'n by and by.

I once was an outcast, 
     stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, 
     and an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted, 
     my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, 
     a robe, and a crown.

A tent or a cottage, 
     why should I care?
They're building a palace 
     for me over there!
Though exiled from home, 
     yet still I may sing:
All glory to God, 
     I'm a child of the King!"
239;Battle Hymn Of The Republic;Ab;"Mine eyes have seen the glory
     of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
     of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
     of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
     in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
     by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
     that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
     before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
     be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
     Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
     that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
     let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on."
240;The Unveiled Christ;C;"Once Our blessed Christ of beauty, 
Was veiled off from human view;
But through suff'ring, 
     death and sorrow,
He has rent the veil in two.

CHORUS
Oh behold the man of sorrows,
Oh behold Him in plain view,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Yes, He is with God, the Father,
Interceding there for you;
For He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due,
For He is the well beloved,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Throughout time and endless ages,
Heights and depths of love so true,
He alone can be the giver,
Since He rent the veil in two."
241;Hold To God's Hand;F;"Time is filled with swift transition,
Naught of earth unmoved can stand,
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging hand!

CHORUS
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging hand!

Trust in Him who will not leave you,
Whatsoever years may bring,
If by earthly friends forsaken,
Still more closely to Him cling!

Covet not this world's vain riches,
That so rapidly decay,
Seek to gain the heavenly treasures,
They will never pass away!

When your journey is completed,
If to God you have been true,
Fair and bright the home in glory,
Your enraptured soul will view!"
242;One Day;C;"One day when heaven 
Was filled with His praises,
One day when sin 
Was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth 
To be born of a virgin -
Dwelt amongst men, 
My example is He!

CHORUS
Living, He loved me; 
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried 
My sins far away;
Rising, He justified 
Freely forever:
One day He's coming - 
Oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him 
Up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him 
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, 
Despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins, 
My Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him 
Alone in the garden,
One day He rested, 
From suffering free;
Angels came down 
O'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, 
My Saviour is He!

One day the grave could 
Conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled 
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death 
He had conquered;
Now is ascended, 
My Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will 
Sound for His coming,
One day the skies with 
His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, 
My beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour, 
This Jesus is mine!"
243;The Lifeboat;F;"We're floating down the stream of time,
We have not long to stay;
The stormy clouds of darkness
Will turn to brightest day.
Then let us all take courage,
For we're not left alone;
The lifeboat soon is coming
To gather the Jewels home.

Chorus
Then cheer, my brother, cheer,
Our trial will soon be o'er,
Our loved ones we shall meet, shall meet,
Upon the golden shore.
We're pilgrims and we're strangers here,
We're seeking a city to come,
The lifeboat soon is coming,
To gather the Jewels home.

Sometimes the Devil tempts me,
And says it's all in vain
To try to live a Christian life
And walk in Jesus' name;
But then we hear the Master say,
""I'll lend you a helping hand,
And if you'll only trust Me,
I'll guide you to the land.""

The lifeboat soon is coming,
By eyes of faith I see
As she sweeps through the waters
To rescue you and me,
And land us safely in the port
With friends we love so dear.
""Get ready,"" cries the Captain;
""Oh, look, she's almost here.""

Oh, now's the time to get on board,
While she is passing by;
But if you stand and wait too long, 
You shall forever die;
The fare is paid for one and all,
The Captain bids you come,
And get on board the lifeboat,
She'll carry you safely home."
244;Down From His Glory;Eb;"Down from His glory, 
Ever living story,
My God and Saviour came, 
And Jesus was His Name.
Born in a manger, 
To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, 
Tears and agony.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Him!  
How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, 
My all in all!
The great Creator 
Became my Saviour,
And all God's fullness 
Dwelleth in Him.

What condescension, 
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night, 
Not one faint hope in sight;
God, gracious, tender, 
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, 
To save my soul.

Without reluctance, 
Flesh and blood His substance,
He took the form of man, 
Revealed the hidden plan.
Oh glorious mystery, 
Sacrifice of Calvary,
And now I know 
Thou art  the great ""I Am."""
245;Bound For The Promised Land;Eb;"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye,
Toward Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

CHORUS
I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns,
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds, nor pois'nous breath,
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
Are feared and felt no more.

When shall I reach that happy place, 
And be forever blest!
When shall I see my Father's face,
And in His bosom rest?"
246;How Great Thou Art;Ab;"Oh Lord my God!  
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds 
Thy hands have made;
I see the stars, 
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy pow'r throughout 
The universe displayed.

CHORUS
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great
    Thou art!"
247;Leave It There;F;"If the world from you withholds 
Of its silver and its gold,
And you have to get along 
With meager fare,
Just remember, in His Word, 
How He feeds the little bird;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

CHORUS
Leave it there, leave it there,
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there;
If you trust and never doubt,
He will surely bring you out;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

If your body suffers pain 
And your health you can't regain,
And your soul is 
Almost sinking in despair,
Jesus knows the pain you feel,
He can save and He can heal;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your enemies assail
And your heart begins to fail,
Don't forget that God 
In heaven answers prayer;
He will make a way for you 
And will lead you safely through;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your youthful days are gone
And old age is stealing on,
And your body bends 
Beneath the weight of care;
He will never leave you then,
He'll go with you to the end;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there."
248;What A Day That Will Be;F;"There is coming a day 
When no heartaches shall come,
No more clouds in the sky, 
No more tears to dim the eye;
All is peace forevermore 
On that happy golden shore,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

CHORUS
What a day that will be
When my Jesus I shall see,
When I look upon His face, 
The One who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand,
And leads me through 
The Promised Land,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

There'll be no sorrow there, 
No more burdens to bear,
No more sickness, no pain, 
No more parting over there;
And forever I will be 
With the One who died for me,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be."
249;Nothing Between;F;"Nothing between my soul and the Saviour,
Naught of this world's delusive dream:
I have renounced all sinful pleasure,
Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.

CHORUS
Nothing between my soul and the Saviour,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favour,
Keep the way clear!  Let nothing between.

Nothing between like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him ever sever;
He is my all, there's nothing between.

Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self or friends shall not intervene;
Though it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved, there's nothing between.

Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,
Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
I'll triumph at last, with nothing between."
250;In Times Like These;F;"In times like these you need a Saviour,
In times like these you need an anchor
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

CHORUS
This rock is Jesus, Yes, He's the One,
This rock is Jesus, the only One;
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these you need the Bible,
In times like these oh be not idle,
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these, I have a Saviour,
In times like these, I have an anchor,
I'm very sure, I'm very sure,
My anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock."
251;He Abides;F;"I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the pilgrim way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see,
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, He abides,
Hallelujah, He abides with me
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care
I'm as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me!

There's no thirsting for the things
Of the world, they've taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter abides with me!"
252;That Man From Galilee;Eb;"In a manger long ago, 
I know it's really so,
A Babe was born 
To save men from their sin.
John saw Him on the shore, 
The Lamb forevermore,
Oh, the Christ, 
The Crucified of Calvary.

CHORUS
Oh I love that Man from Galilee,
For He's done so very much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins, 
Placed the Holy Ghost within;
Oh I love that man 
     from Galilee.

The publican went to pray 
In the temple there one day,
He cried, ""O Lord 
     be merciful to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this Man 
     from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk, 
The dumb was made to talk,
That power was spoken with 
Love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man 
     from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of Man 
What must he do.
These words He said to him, 
""Ye must be born again,""
By the Spirit of that Man 
     from Galilee.

The woman at the well, 
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands 
She had at that time,
She was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that 
     Man from Galilee!"""
253;Then Jesus Came;C;"One sat alone beside the 
    highway begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he 
    could not see;
He clutched his rags and shivered 
    in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and bade his 
    darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the tempter's 
    power is broken;
When Jesus comes, the tears 
    are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the 
    life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus 
    comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil 
    spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
He cut himself as demon pow'rs 
    possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the 
    captive free.

Unclean! unclean! The leper cried 
    in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness 
    stood near;
The fever raged, disease had gripped 
    its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast 
    out every fear.

So men today have found the 
    Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion, 
    lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them sad 
    and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt 
    Himself within."
254;Such Love;F;"That God should love 
A sinner such as I,
Should yearn to change
My sorrow into bliss,
Nor rest till He 
Had planned to bring me nigh,
How wonderful is love like this!

CHORUS
Such love, such wondrous love,
Such love, such wondrous love,
That God should love 
A sinner such as I,
How wonderful is love like this!

That Christ should join 
So freely in the scheme,
Although it meant 
His death on Calvary,
Did ever human tongue 
Find nobler theme
Than love divine 
That ransomed me?

That for a wilful 
Outcast such as I,
The Father planned, 
The Saviour bled and died;
Redemption for 
A worthless slave to buy,
Who long had law 
And grace defied.

And now He takes me 
To His heart, a son,
He asks me not 
To fill a servant's place;
The ""far-off country"" 
Wand'rings all are done,
Wide open are 
His arms of grace."
255;When The Saints March In;Eb;"I'm a pilgrim and a stranger
Wand'ring through this world of sin,
On my way to that fair city,
When the Saints go marching in.

CHORUS
When the saints go marching in,
When the saints go marching in,
Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in.

Oh, I know I'll see my Saviour 
If my life is free from sin,
Heaven's doors will open for me
When the Saints go marching in.

When we gather 'round the Throne
And the gates are closed within,
I'll be shouting ""Glory, Glory""
When the Saints go marching in.

I'm waiting for the chariot
To swing low and I'll step in,
On the clouds I'll ride to Heaven
When the Saints go marching in."
256;The Day Of Redemption;F;"Nations are breaking, 
Israel's awaking,
The signs that the prophets 
     foretold;
The Gentile days numbered, 
With horrors encumbered;
Eternity soon will unfold.

CHORUS
The day of redemption is here,
Men's hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Your lamps trimmed and clear,
Look up! Your redemption is here.

The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem's restoring
Her national life, long dethroned;
Today she is calling, 
Her latter rain's falling,
""Return, Oh dispersed, to your own.""

Heaven's powers are shaking, 
And many are mistaking
God's meaning to be of the sky;
God's Church is the power
That's shaking this hour:
The day of redemption is nigh.

False prophets are lying, 
God's Truth they're denying,
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generation 
Spurns God's revelation,
We'll walk where the apostles 
     have trod."
257;Oh My Loving Brother;F;"Oh the judgment day is coming
What an awful day 'twill be,
Christ forever is my refuge
Rock of ages cleft for me.

CHORUS
Oh, my loving brother,
When the world's on fire,
Don't you want God's bosom
To be your pillow,
Hide me over in the rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me.

At the sounding of the trumpet,
At the dawning of the day,
Worldly pleasures with their treasures,
Shall forever pass away.

Poor lost sinners will be crying,
For the home they'll never see,
But the ransomed will be singing
Rock of ages, cleft for me."
258;Lights Of That City;F;"John tells of a city, 
That he saw coming down,
Where no sorrow or death will be known,
That someday we could go there
Through His marvelous grace,
Forever live in that heavenly home.

CHORUS
I can almost see the lights of that city,
I see them gathering, all around
The great white throne;
With faith in my Saviour,
And His wonderful love,
Oh, I can almost see the lights of home.

And sometimes when I'm burdened,
And my cross seems hard to bear.
And old Satan, he tries to dim my view,
Well I just look unto Jesus,
He is standing close by,
Then once again, 
His great light shines through."
259;I'm Looking For A City;F;"I'm looking for a city,
The one not made by hands,
I'm looking over Jordan,
I see the promised land,
The waters will be parted
And I'll be on my way,
As we're crossing over Jordan 
I can say:

CHORUS
Now I have that everlasting joy within,
Since He came and took away my sin,
The moment that He blessed me,
He made me fully whole,
With that everlasting joy 
Within my soul.

I'm drinking from the fountain
That floweth from on high,
A well of blessed waters
That never shall run dry,
I'm feasting on God's manna,
I'm praying day by day,
And that everlasting joy 
Is here to stay.

I've heard the prophet's message, 
I've placed it in my heart,
I've got the revelation 
That never shall depart,
The Rapture is upon us,
The stage is set to go.
We have this precious promise 
We all know."
260;All That Thrills My Soul;Bb;"Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
By His presence all divine?
True and Tender, pure and precious,
Oh how blest to call Him mine!

CHORUS
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me;
And the fairest of ten thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.

Love of Christ so freely given,
Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea.

What a wonderful redemption!
Never can a mortal know
How my sin, tho' red like crimson,
Can be whiter than the snow.

Every need His hand supplying,
Every good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying,
He is all in all to me.

By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King."
261;Come And Go With Me;F;"Come and go with me
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House.
Come and go with me,
To my Father's House,
Where There's peace, peace, peace.

Jesus will be there
In my Father's House
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House.
Jesus will be there
In my Father's House,
Where there's peace, peace, peace.

There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House, 
In my Father's House.
There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House.
There'll be joy, real joy."
262;I'll Fly Away;G;"Some glad morning 
When this life is o'er
I'll fly away,
To a home on God's 
     celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away, oh glory, 
I'll fly away;
Before I die, 
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows 
Of this life have grown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird from prison 
     bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more 
Weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys 
     shall never end,
I'll fly away."
263;It Is Love;F;"There is something in my soul 
Which keeps the shadows all away;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something lightens ev'ry burden,
Gives me gladness day by day,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

CHORUS
Oh the precious love of Jesus,
How it thrills my ransomed soul!
More and more I'll sing its praises
While the happy ages roll.

When the tempter tries to win me
Something keeps me true and strong;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something makes my life a blessing
To the needy in the throng,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

When misfortune overtakes me
Something calms my troubled breast;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something draws my soul to heaven,
That sweet land of peace and rest.
It is love, my Saviour's love.

Soul astray and bowed in sorrow,
Something waits for you today;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
It would give you peace and comfort,
Make your burdens roll away,
It is love, my Saviour's love."
264;My Sins Are Gone;Eb;"You ask me why I'm happy
So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;
And when I meet the scoffers
Who ask me where they are,
I say, my sins are gone.

CHORUS
They're underneath the Blood,
Of the Cross of Calvary,
As far removed as darkness 
     is from dawn;
In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
That's good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me 
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

I'm living now for Jesus,
I'm happy night and day,
Because my sins are gone;
My soul is filled with music,
With all my heart I say,
I know my sins are gone."
265;He Set Me Free;F;"Once like a bird 
In prison I dwelt.
No freedom from 
My sorrow I felt.
Then Jesus came 
And listened to me,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

CHORUS
He set me free, 
Yes, He set me free.
He broke the bonds 
Of prison for me.
I'm glory bound 
My Jesus to see,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

Now I am climbing 
Higher each day,
Darkness of night 
Has drifted away.
My feet are planted 
On higher ground,
Glory to God, 
I'm homeward bound.

Good-bye to sin 
And things that confound,
Naught of this world 
Shall turn me around,
Daily I'm working, 
I'm praying too,
Glory to God, 
I'm going through."
266;The Great Emancipator;Ab;"Once my heart and soul were fettered
By the binding chains of sin.
But the Great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Blessed be His holy name!
He's the Great Emancipator,
That's the song of the Redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting
Oh so helpless and alone, 
But the seeking Shepherd found me,
Led me to my Father's home."
267;The Original Life;Ab;"God's attributes were manifested
To His Bride in this last age.
We have caught the revelation
By the last prophet's message.
And we know who we are
And what we are raised up for,
Praise the Lord, for the Original Life.

CHORUS
The Original Life, the Original Seed
The Original Word is what I believe.
The Son of Man is revealed
The seventh seal is unveiled
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say.
And our names are seen within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin.
Yes, we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who's the Original Life.

Our eyes of understanding
He has opened up at last.
And sweet victory is ours
Who were chained down in the past.
True Jubilee has sounded
And we have responded
To our God, Who's the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power.
Sleeping saints will wake and join us
For translation in this hour.
Gentiles' days will soon be over
Glory, hallelujah!
To our God, Who's the Original Life."
268;All In All;F;"Of Jesus love I'm singing
I praise Him every day;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He frees my soul from bondage,
He takes my guilt away;
Jesus is my All in All.

CHORUS
All in All, All in All,
A strength in time of weariness
A light when shadows fall.
All in All, All in All,
Jesus is my All in All.

He's patient and so tender,
So loving and so kind;
He is my All in All, All in All.
Another Friend so faithful
My soul will never find;
Jesus is my All in All.

In time of need no other
To me can prove so dear;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He hears me tho' I whisper,
To help me he is near;
Jesus is my All in All."
269;Till We Meet;Bb;"God be with you 'til we meet again!
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!

CHORUS
Till we meet! 'Til we meet!
Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
Till we meet! 'Til we meet!
God be with you 'til we meet again!

God be with you 'til we meet again!
'Neath His wings securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!

God be with you 'til we meet again!
When life's perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!

God be with you 'til we meet again!
Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
Smite death's threat'ning wave 
     before you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!"
270;More About Jesus;F;"More about Jesus I would know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

CHORUS
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus in His Word, 
Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace."
271;Psalm 19;Eb;"The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure,
Making wise the simple.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The statutes of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure,
Enlightening the eyes.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.
And in the keeping of them
There is great reward,
There is great reward.
In the keeping of them
There is great reward."
272;The Church's One Foundation;C;"The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord:
She is His new creation
By water and the Word.
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth,
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping
Their cry goes up, ""How long?""
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song.

Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore.
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the church at rest."
273;His Banner Over Me Is Love;F;"He  brought me to His banqueting table
His banner over me is love;
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

He set straight paths before my feet
His banner over me is love,
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

He broke the chains and He set me free
His banner over me is love
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

I am my Beloved's and He is mine
His banner over me is love,
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love."
274;Deeper In That Holy Life;F;"Deeper In Thy love, Oh Jesus
Doth my spirit cry to go.
Until all my life is hidden 
Deep within the cleansing flow.

CHORUS
Deeper in that holy life
'Til I'm lost with Christ in God.
Hidden with my blessed Lord
While I walk this earthly sod.

Humbly must I walk with Jesus
In the paths that He doth lead.
Never falter, never murmur
Always to His voice give heed.

Daily must I seek to please Him
Whether it bring joy or pain.
I shall know then just how blessed
Is the worth of Heav'nly gain.

Deeper, 'til at last in Glory
In His likeness I shall come.
Where the saints of all the ages
Shall receive their welcome home."
275;We Are Heirs;Ab;"We are heirs of the Father
We are joint-heirs with the Son.
We are people of His Kingdom
We are family, we are one.

We are washed,
We are sanctified.
We are cleansed by His blood.
We are born of the Spirit
We are children of the Lord.

We are members of His body.
We are objects of His love.
We're partakers of His holiness
We are citizens of heaven above.

We're partakers of His suffering;
We're partakers of His grace.
We shall meet Him to be like Him
We shall see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming
We are looking to the skies;
We are watching, we are waiting,
We shall dwell with Him, we shall rise.

We shall reign with Him forever;
Men and angels shout and sing.
For dominion has been given
To the family of the King."
276;He's The Lord Of Glory;Eb;"Behold what manner of man is this,
Who stills the raging sea.
He heals the sick, the lame, the halt,
And makes the blind to see.
He opens all the prison doors
And sets the captives free.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

CHORUS
He's the Lord of glory
He is the great ""I Am""
The Alpha and Omega,
The beginning and the end.
His name is Wonderful
The Prince of Peace is He
He's the everlasting Father
Throughout eternity.

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who spake to the woman at the well.
Everlasting life I will give to thee,
Far richer than man can tell
And whosoever shall drink of the well
Shall live eternally.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who speaks to the lame and halt.
He says ""Thy sins be forgiven thee,
Take up thy bed and walk""
He stands as the mighty healer now
And cries ""Come unto me""
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this
Who stands between God and man.
His eyes are as a flame of fire
His fan is in His hand.
John saw Him in the seven churches
As the sun in brilliancy
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who sits on His heavenly throne.
He rules and reigns from heaven above
His beloved and His own.
He's the lion of the tribe of Judah,
The root of David is He.
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?"
277;He Touched Me;Eb;"Shackled by a heavy burden
'Neath a load of guilt and shame,
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same.

CHORUS
He touched me,
Oh, He touched me,
And oh, the joy 
That floods my soul!
Something happened, 
And now I know,
He touched me, 
And made me whole.

Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed 
And made me whole,
I shall never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls."
278;This World Is Not My Home;F;"This world is not my home
I'm just a'passing through
My treasures are laid up 
Somewhere beyond the blue.
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

CHORUS
Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

They're all expecting me
And that's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus
Many years ago.
I know He'll see me through
Tho' I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Just over in the gloryland,
We'll live eternally;
The saints on every hand
Are shouting ""victory"".
The songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore."
279;Lead Me To Calvary;Eb;"King of my life I crown Thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned 
     brow,
Lead me to Calvary.

CHORUS
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony,
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou 
     wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept:
Angels in robes of light arrayed,
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me, like Mary, through 
     the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee:
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear,
Daily my cross for Thee:
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Fill me, Oh Lord, with Thy desire,
For all who know not Thee:
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
To speak of Calvary."
280;I Don't Know What I'd Do;F;"I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord;
When I look around and see,
All that He has done for me,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord.

281;Whisper A Prayer;F;"Whisper a prayer in the morning,
Whisper a prayer at noon,
Whisper a prayer in the evening,
To keep your heart in tune.

Jesus may come in the morning,
Jesus may come at noon,
Jesus may come in the evening,
So keep your heart in tune."
282;It Is Well With My Soul;C;"When peace like a river
Attendeth my way,
When sorrows, 
Like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, 
Thou hast taught me to say,
""It is well, it is well with my soul.""

CHORUS
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well 
With my soul.

Tho' Satan should buffet,
Tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control.
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood
     for my soul.

My sin - oh, the bliss 
Of this glorious thought -
My sin - not in part, 
But the whole
Is nailed to the cross;
And I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Oh my soul.

And Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight.
The clouds be rolled back 
     as a scroll.
The trump shall resound, 
And the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee,
For Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, 
     is our goal;
Oh, the shout of the angel!
Oh, the voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope!
Blessed rest of my soul!"
283;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God;C;"A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe -
His craft and pow'r are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He -
Lord Sabaoth His name,
From age to age the same -
And He must win the battle.

And tho this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph thru us.
The Prince of darkness grim - 
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! His doom is sure -
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow'rs -
No thanks to them - abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Thru Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still -
His kingdom is forever."

285;Arise, My Soul, Arise;Ab;"Arise, my soul, arise;
Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding sacrifice

Before the throne my surety stands,
Before the throne my surety stands,
My name is written on His hands.

He ever lives above, 
For me to intercede;
His all redeeming love, 
His precious blood, to plead:
His blood atoned for all our race,
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

Five bleeding wounds He bears;
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers; 
They strongly plead for me:
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Nor let that ransomed sinner die!""

The Father hears Him pray,
His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away, 
The presence of His Son;
His Spirit answers to the blood,
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.

My God is reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear:
With confidence I now draw nigh,
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And ""Father, Abba, Father,"" cry."
286;His Way With Thee;F;"Would you live for Jesus and 
     be always pure and good?
Would you walk with Him 
     within the narrow road?
Would you have Him bear your 
     burden, carry all your load?
Let Him have His way with thee.

CHORUS
His pow'r can make you what you
     ought to be,
His blood can cleanse your heart
     and make you free:
His love can fill your soul,
And you will see 'twas best for Him
To have His way with Thee.

Would you have Him make you free, 
     and follow at His call?
Would you know the peace that
     comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you,
     so that you need never fall?
Let Him have His way with Thee.

Would you in His kingdom find
     a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true
     in providential test?
Would you in His service labour
     always at your best?
Let Him have His way with Thee."
287;I'm Longing For Jesus To Come;F;"I'm longing for that glorious day
When Jesus shall come back,
I long to see His blessed face.
When all the saints 
Throughout the ages
Shall be gathered home
The ones who trusted in His grace

CHORUS
I'm longing for Jesus to come back
I long for Jesus Christ my King
To come and take me
To my home beyond the skies,
Up there where angels shout and sing.

Sometimes the road 
Seems rough and hard,
The pathway seems so long,
But He is ever by my side.
He whispers loving words to me
And tells me to be strong,
That He will always lead and guide."
288;Thank God I Am Free;G;"For a long time I travelled
Down a long lonely road;
My heart was so heavy in sin I sank low.
Then I heard about Jesus,
What a wonderful hour;
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out
Through His saving power.

CHORUS
Thank God I am free, free, free
From this world of sin.
Been washed in the blood of Jesus,
I've been born again.
Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved
By His wonderful grace.
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out 
And show me the way.

Like a bird out of prison
That's taken its flight;
Like a blind man that God 
Gave back  his sight.
Like a poor wretched beggar
That's found fortune and fame,
I'm so glad that I found out 
He could bring me out
Thro' His Holy name."
289;Land Of Milk And Honey;G;"There is a land of milk and honey
There is a land
Where we won't need money.
There is a land 
Shining with jasper.
There we shall see 
Our blessed Saviour.

CHORUS
And that's the reason
We shout ""Hallelujah""
Praising our King across the river.
That shining river
Where the saints will gather
There we shall see 
Our blessed Messiah.

Elijah has come, 
He has done his work already
As John has said, 
The Bride has made ready.
And now we are waiting 
For the coming of Jesus.
For that blessed day
When the Lamb shall take us.

Our hopes are bright, 
Our lamps are burning.
And day by day 
Our hearts are yearning.
This is the evening
He will come in the morning.
Then we shall wait 
Until the dawning."
290;He Paid A Debt;C;"He paid a debt He did not owe,
I owed a debt I could not pay,
I needed someone to wash 
     my sins away;
And now I sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay.

He paid a debt at Calvary,
He cleansed my soul and 
     set me free,
I'm glad that Jesus did all 
     my sins erase.
I now can sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay.

One day He's coming back for me,
To live with Him eternally,
Won't it be glory to see Him 
     on that day!
I then will sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay."
291;Until Then;Ab;"My heart can sing 
When I pause to remember,
A heartache here  
Is but a stepping stone,
Along the trail 
That's winding always upward,
This troubled world 
Is not my final home.

CHORUS
But until then, 
My heart will go on singing,
Until then, 
With joy I'll carry on.
Until the day 
Mine eyes behold the city
Until the day 
God calls me home.

The things of earth 
Will dim and lose their value,
If we recall, 
They're borrowed for awhile
And things of earth 
That cause the heart to tremble
Remember there, 
Will only bring a smile.

This weary world 
With all its toil and struggle,
May take its toll 
Of misery and strife,
The soul of man 
Is like a waiting eagle
When it's released 
It's destined for the sky."
292;This Is Like Heaven To Me;F;"We find many people 
Who can't understand
Why we are so happy and free,
We've crossed over Jordan 
To Canaan's fair land,
And this is like heaven to me.

CHORUS
Oh this is like heaven to me,
Yes, this is like heaven to me.
I've crossed over Jordan 
To Canaan's fair land,
And this is like heaven to me.

So when we are happy 
We sing and we shout,
Some don't understand us, you see;
We're filled with the Spirit, 
There is not a doubt,
And this is like heaven to me.

We've heard the sweet music, 
The heavenly chord
From glory land over the sea;
A soul-thrilling message 
From Jesus our Lord,
And this is like heaven to me."
293;I've Been Changed;Ab;"I've been to the water,
And I've been baptized,
I've been washed 
In the blood of the Lamb;
I've been changed 
From the creature
That I once was,
And redeemed is now my name.

CHORUS
I've been changed, 
I've been reborn,
All my life has been rearranged;
What a difference it makes
When the Lord has His way
All my life praise God, 
Has been changed.

Tho' my sins were as scarlet
They're white as snow,
I was bound but today I am free;
I was lost in the darkness
But now I'm found,
I was blind but now I see.

When at last in His presence
I stand above,
He will wipe every tear 
From my eyes;
And I'll thank Him for giving 
A wretch like me,
A new home beyond the sky."
294;I'm In That Number;Ab;"I'm in that number, I'm in that number,
I'm in that number robed in white;
I'm in that number, I'm in that number,
I'm in that number robed in white.

I'm in that  number,
That blood-washed number,
I'm in that number robed in white;
I'm in that number
That blood-washed number,
I'm in that number robed in white.

John saw that number,
The blood-washed number,
John saw that number robed in white;
John saw that number,
That blood-washed number,
John saw that number robed in white."
295;Let Go Of The Old;Eb;"Let, let go of the old,
And lay, lay hold on the new,
In laying it down a new life is found
There a new life waits for you.

Cast your bread upon the waters
After many days it shall return.
If you pour out your soul
Not a part, but the whole
A new life is there for you.

In saving your life, you will lose it,
But by losing it, you will find it,
Down in the ground 
That's where death is found,
Death that brings life anew."
296;Cause Me To Come;F;"Cause me to come to Thy river, Oh Lord;

For the chains of defeat there's no key.

As the chörus rings out.
The shackled released from their chains,
And thousands of voices
Are swelling the song,
Worthy the lamb that was slain.

Chorus

To purchase my redemption
He hung upon a tree.
At last He cried ""Tis finished""

My Jesus crucified.

They mocked Him 
And they scoffed Him,
With thorns they crowned His head,
As a lamb unto the slaughter
My Saviour! -  He was led.
The soldier's cruel dagger 
Was thrust into His side,
Oh what a sight for sinners,
My Saviour crucified.

I have a risen Savior,

I tell it now to thee

I love to tell the story; 
'Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems each time I tell it,

Sing it with the saints in glory,

Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me, 
Drew me back into the way.

I was bruised but Jesus healed me,  
Faint was I from many a fall,
Sight was gone, 
And fears possessed me, 
But He freed me from them all.

Soon He'll come the Lord of Glory,  
Come the church His bride to claim,
And complete the wondrous story, 
Come, Lord Jesus, come again.

Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He'll bear me safely over, 
Where the loved ones I shall meet."

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away,
He holdeth me up, 
And I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

Each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,
For such a Redeemer as mine!

Transported I rise,
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, 
His wonderful love,

Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

Do you want the fire of God
     to fill your soul,
Burn up all the dross,
     and sanctify the whole?
Make the consecration,
Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

Do you want the pow'r
     to make you true and brave,
So that you can rescue
     those that Christ would save?
Make the consecration,
Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in."

This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,  
Sent from the Saviour above.

Chorus
Showers of blessing, 
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,  
But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing  
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,  
Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of blessing.  
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,  
Come, and now honor Thy Word.

There shall be showers of blessing.  
Oh that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing, 
Now as on Jesus we call!"

Saved by His pow'r divine,  
Saved to new life sublime!
Life now is sweet 
And my joy is complete,

He saves me from 
Ev'ry sin and harm,  
Secures my soul each day;
I'm leaning strong on His mighty arm;  
I know He'll guide me all the way.

When poor and needy 
     and all alone,  
In love He said to me, 
""Come unto me and I'll 
     lead you home,  
To live with me eternally."""
320;There Is Power In The Blood;Ab;"Would you be free 
From the burden of sin?

    a victory win?
There's wonderful pow'r 
     in the blood.

CHORUS
There is power, power, 
    wonder-working pow'r
In the blood of the Lamb;
There is power, power 
     wonder-working pow'r
In the precious blood 
     of the Lamb.

Would you be free 
From your passion and pride?
There's pow'r in the blood, 
    pow'r in the blood;
Come for a cleansing 
    to Calvary's tide;
There's wonderful pow'r 
     in the blood.

Would you be whiter, 
    much whiter than snow?
There's pow'r in the blood, 
    pow'r in the blood;
Sin-stains are lost 
    in its life-giving flow;
There's wonderful pow'r 
     in the blood.

Would you do service 
    for Jesus your King?
There's pow'r in the blood, 
    pow'r in the blood;
Would you live daily 
    His praises to sing?
There's wonderful pow'r 
     in the blood."
321;I'm Glad I'm One Of Them;Ab;"There are people almost everywhere,
Whose hearts are all aflame,
With the fire that fell at Pentecost,
Which cleansed and made them clean;
It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His name!
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

CHORUS
One of them, one of them,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!
One of them, one of them,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

Though these people may not 
      learned be,
Nor boast of worldly fame,
They have all received their Pentecost,
Baptized in Jesus' name;
And are telling now, both far and wide,
His pow'r is yet the same,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

They were gathered in the upper room,
All praying in His name,
They were baptized with the 
     Holy Ghost,
And pow'r for service came;
Now what He did for them that day
He'll do for you the same;
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

Come, my brother, seek this blessing
That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy-bells ringing
And will keep the soul aflame;
It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His name,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!"
322;Living Where the Healing Waters Flow;F;"I've cast my heavy burdens down 
      on Canaan's happy shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
I'll wander in the wilderness of
      doubt and sin no more;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

Chorus 
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, 
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

With Israel's trusting children
     I'm rejoicing on my way, 
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
The cloudy, fiery pillar
     is my guiding light today.
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

My hung'ring soul is satisfied 
     with manna from above,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
No more I thirst, the rock I've found,
      that fount of endless love;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

I'm singing ""Hallelujah,""
      safely anchored in my soul,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
I'm resting on his promises; 
      the blood has made me whole.
I'm living where the healing waters flow."
323;Hidden Peace;C;"I cannot tell thee whence it came. 
This peace within my breast;
But this I know, there fills my soul
A strange and tranquil rest.

Chorus
There's a deep, settled peace in my soul,
There's a deep settled peace in my soul;
Tho' the billows of sin near me roll, 
He abides, Christ abides.

Beneath the toil and care of life,
This hidden stream flows on;
My weary soul no longer thirsts,
Nor am I sad and lone.

I cannot tell the half of love,
Unfeigned, supreme, divine,
That caused my darkest in-most self
With beams of hope to shine.

I cannot tell thee why He chose
To suffer and to die,
But if I suffer here with Him
I'll reign with Him on high."
324;I Would Not Be Denied;C;"When pangs of death 
Seized on my soul,
Unto the Lord I cried,
Till Jesus came and 
     made me whole,
I would not be denied.

CHORUS
I would not be denied,
I would not be denied,
Till Jesus came and 
     made me whole,
I would not be denied.

As Jacob in the days of old,
I wrestled with the Lord;
And instant, with 
     a courage bold,
I stood upon His word.

Old Satan said my Lord 
     was gone
And would not hear my prayer,
But, praise the Lord! 
The work is done
And Christ the Lord is here."
325;The Solid Rock;F;"My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

CHORUS
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne."
326;Deeper, Deeper;G;"Deeper, deeper,
In the love of Jesus
Daily let me go;
Higher, higher,
In the school of wisdom,
More of grace to know.

CHORUS
Deeper yet, I pray,
And higher every day,
And wiser, blessed Lord,
In Thy precious, holy Word.

Deeper, deeper!  
Blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is 
Wholly lost in Jesus,
And His perfect will.

Deeper, deeper! 
Though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the 
Holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

Deeper, higher, 
Every day in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqueror, 
And in His own image
Perfected at last."

He sanctified my soul,
He honors my confessions, 
Since by His blood I'm whole.

Chorus
It is truly wonderful 
What the Lord has done!
It is truly wonderful! 
It is truly wonderful!
It is truly wonderful  
What the Lord has done!
Glory to His name.

He keeps me every moment  
By trusting in His grace;
'Tis thro His blest atonement,  
That I may see His face.

He brings me through affliction,  
He leaves me not alone;
He's with me in temptation, 
He keeps me for His own.

He prospers and protects me,  
His blessings ever flow;
He fills me with His glory, 
He makes me white as snow.

He keeps me firm and faithful,  
His love I do enjoy,
For this I shall be grateful,
And live in His employ.

There's not a single blessing  
Which we receive on earth
That does not come from heaven,  
The source of our new birth."
328;Beulah Land;F;"I've reached the land of corn and wine, 
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.

Chorus
Oh Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.
As on Thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory-shore,
My heav'n, my home forevermore!

My Savior comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by the hand, 
For this is heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from eververnal trees,
And flow'rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody.
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song."
329;A Shelter In The Time Of Storm;F;"The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever ill be tide,
A shelter in the time of storm.

CHORUS
Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land,
A weary land, A weary land;
Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land -
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shade by day, defense by night,
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes afright,
A shelter in the time of storm.

The raging storms may round us beat,
A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.

Oh Rock divine, Oh Refuge dear,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our Helper ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm."
330;The Haven Of Rest;F;"My soul in sad exile 
Was out on life's sea,
So burdened with sin 
     and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice 
Saying, ""Make me your choice;""
And I entered the Haven of Rest.

CHORUS
I've anchored my soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
I'll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep 
O'er the wild, stormy deep;
In Jesus I'm safe evermore.

I yielded myself 
To his tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, 
And I anchored my soul;
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, 
Since the Lord made me whole,    
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus who'll save 
Whosoever will have
A home in the Haven of Rest.

How precious the thought 
That we all may recline,
Like John the beloved and blest,
On Jesus' strong arm 
Where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the Haven of Rest.

Oh come to the Savior, 
He patiently waits,
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
And say, ""My Beloved is mine."""
331;There Is A Fountain Filled With Blood;Bb;"There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God
Are saved, to sin no more,
Are saved, to sin no more,
Are saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God
Are saved, to sin no more.

For since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave."

Standing on the promises of God.

CHORUS
Standing, standing, 
Standing on the promises 
Of God, my Savior;
Standing, standing, 
I'm standing on 
The promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
That cannot fail,
When the howling storms 
Of doubt and fear assail,
By the living Word of God 
I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I now can see
Perfect, present cleansing 
In the blood for me;
Standing in the liberty 
Where Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
Of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally 
By love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily 
With the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I cannot fall,
Listening every moment 
To the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Savior 
As my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God."
333;How Firm A Foundation;G;"How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said, 
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled?
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, I will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee and cause thee
     to stand,
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for  repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor
     to shake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"
334;Alone With God;F;"When storms of life are round 
     me beating.
When rough the path that I have trod,
Within my closet door retreating,
I love to be alone with God.

Chorus
Alone with God, the world forbidden.
Alone with God, Oh blest retreat!
Alone with God and in Him hidden,
To hold with Him communion sweet.

What tho' the clouds have 
    gathered o'er me?
What tho' I've passed beneath the rod?
God's perfect will there lies before me,
When I am thus alone with God.

'Tis there I find new strength for duty,
As o'er the sands of time I plod;
I see the King in all His beauty.
While resting there alone with God.

And when I see the moment nearing
When I shall sleep beneath the sod,
When time with me is disappearing,
I want to be alone with God."
335;Marching On;C;"Marching on in the light of God,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Up the path that the Master trod, 
Marching, marching on.

Chorus
A robe of white, a crown of gold,
A harp, a home, a mansion fair,
A victor's palm, a joy untold,
Are mine when I get there.

Marching on thro' the hosts of sin, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Vict'ry's mine, while I've Christ within,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on while the skeptics sneer, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Perfect love casteth out all fear,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on with the flag unfurled,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Preaching Christ to the dying world,
Marching, marching on."
336;Praise The Lord;Ab;"To God be the glory,

An atonement for sin,
And opened the Life Gate 
That all may go in.

CHORUS

Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, 
Through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; 
Great things He hath done.

Oh, perfect redemption, 
The purchase of blood,
To every believer 
The promise of God;
The vilest offender 
Who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus 
A pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing 
Through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, 
And greater will be
Our wonder, our transport 
When Jesus we see."

Oh to be like Thee,
Blessed Redeemer, 
Pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, 
Come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image 
Deep on my heart.

Full of compassion,
Loving, forgiving, 
Tender and kind,
Helping the helpless, 
Cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wandering 
Sinner to find.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless, 
Patient and brave;
Meekly enduring 
Cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer, 
Others to save.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lord, I am coming,
Now to receive 
Th' anointing divine,
All that I am and have 
I am bringing,
Lord, from this moment 
All shall be Thine.

Oh to be like Thee, 
While I am pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit, 
Fill with Thy love,
Make me a temple 
Meet for Thy dwelling,
Fit me for life 
And heaven above."
338;Count Your Blessings;C;"When upon life's billows

CHORUS
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Count your blessings,
See what God hath done;

Are you ever burdened 
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing 
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised 
You His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings, 
Money cannot buy
Your reward in Heaven, 
Nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict, 
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, 
God is over all;
Count your many blessings, 
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you 
To your journey's end."
339;What A Friend;F;"What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there."
340;I Will Praise Him;C;"When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing,
When He said, Wilt thou be clean?

CHORUS
I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His blood has washed away 
     each stain.

Though the way seems straight 
     and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him,
Glory, glory to His name!

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in;
He's forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin."
341;Ho! Everyone that Is Thirsty;F;"Ho! ev'ry one that is thirsty in spirit,

Chorus
""I will pour water on him 
    who is thirsty, 
I will pour floods upon 
     the dry ground;
Open your heart 
For the gift I am bringing,
While ye are seeking Me, 
I will be found.""

Child of the world, 
Are you tired of your bondage?
Weary of earth-joys,
So false, so untrue;
Thirsting for God, 
And his fullness of blessing?
List to the promise -- 
A message for you.

Child of the kingdom, 
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Nothing but fullness 
Thy longing can meet.
'Tis the enduement 
For life and for service;
Thine is the promise, 
So certain, so sweet."

Feasting, I am feasting
On the living Word.

Feeding on the honey 
     and the wine,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Gathering the clusters 
     from the vine,
Feasting with my Lord.

Day by day we have 
     a new supply,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
And the food is never 
     stale nor dry,
Feasting with my Lord.

Many times we have 
     an extra spread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Then to deeper truths 
     I have been led,
Feasting with my Lord.

Often there are only 
     just us two,
Feasting I'm feasting
Then He tells me what 
     He'd have me do,
Feasting with my Lord.

If perchance the cupboard's
     scarce of bread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
On the hidden manna 
      I am fed,
Feasting with my Lord."

Oh say, but I'm glad;
Jesus has come 
And my cup's overrun;
Oh say but I'm glad.

Wonderful, marvelous 
Love He brings,
Into a heart that's sad;
Through darkest tunnels 
The soul just sings,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

We have a fellowship 
Rich and sweet,
Tongues can never relate;
Abiding in Him is a real treat,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

Won't you come to Him 
With all your care,
Weary and worn and sad?
You too, will sing 
As His love you share.
Oh say, but I'm glad."

While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

CHORUS
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey."
346;The Breaking of the Day;Eb;"'Tis almost time for the Lord to come, 
I hear the people say;
The stars of heav'n are growing dim:
It must be the breaking of the day.

Chorus
O, it must be the breaking of the day,
O, it must be the breaking of the day;
The night is almost gone,
The day is coming on:
O, it must be the breaking of the day.

The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
In earth and sea and sky,
Aloud proclaim to mortal men,
That the coming of the Master
     draweth nigh.

It must be time for the waiting church 
To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps
To look for the breaking of the day.

There must be those in the field of sin,
Far from the fold astray,
Who once were happy in Jesus' love,
And looking for the breaking of the day.

Go quickly out in the streets and lanes,
And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt and blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the day."
347;Faith Of Our Fathers! Living Still;G;"Faith of our fathers! living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
Oh how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word

CHORUS
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children's fate,
If they, like them, could die for Thee!

Faith of our fathers! we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, 
As love knows how,
By kindly words and virtuous life!"
348;Under His Wings;C;"Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Though the night deepens 
     and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him, 
I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, 
And I am His child.

CHORUS
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

Under His wings, 
What a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly 
Turns to His rest!
Often when earth has 
No balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, 
And there I am blest.

Under His wings, 
O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till 
Life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, 
No evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus 
I'm safe evermore."
349;Lead Me, Savior;C;"Savior lead me, lest I stray,
Gently lead me all the way;
I am safe when by Thy side, 
I would in Thy love abide.

Chorus
Lead me, lead me, Savior, 
lead me, lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me Savior, all the way.

Thou the refuge of my soul,
When life's stormy billows roll,
I am safe when Thou art nigh,
All my hopes on Thee rely.

Savior, lead me, then at last, 
When the storm of life is past,
To the land of endless day, 
Where all tears are wiped away."
350;I See A Crimson Stream;Ab;"On Calvary's hill of sorrow
Where sin's demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid.

CHORUS
I see a crimson stream of blood.
It flows from Calvary,
Its waves which reach 
     the throne of God,
Are sweeping over me.

Today no condemnation
Abides to turn away
My soul from His salvation,
He's in my heart to stay.

When gloom and sadness whisper
You've sinned, no use to pray,
I look away to Jesus,
And He tells me to say:

And when we reach the portal
Where life forever reigns,
The ransomed hosts grand final
Will be this glad refrain."
351;Like Zion's Holy Mount;C;"All they who put their trust in God
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount,
By many ages proved.

Chorus
Like the mount of God, 
Like the mount of God;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
By many ages proved.
They can never be removed, removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
They can never be removed.

As round about Jerusalem
The rugged mountains lie,
So round about His holy saints
Our God is ever nigh.

Tho' fierce the storm in fury beat
And awful thunders roar,
The children of the mighty God
Are safe forevermore.

Thus over-shadowed by His love,
Where harm can ne'er betide,
Within this refuge safe and sure
I ever would abide"
352;My Faith Looks Up To Thee;Eb;"My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Savior divine!
Now hear me while I pray,
Take all my guilt away,
O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When ends life's transient dream,
When death's cold, sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll;
Blest Savior, then, in love,
Fear and distrust remove;
O bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul!"
353;Blessed Be The Name;Ab;"All praise to Him who reigns above,
In majesty supreme,
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem.

CHORUS
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

His name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father's own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.

His name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace;
Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man,
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,
For Thou hast died for all.

Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord;
Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord.

There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord;
There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord.

Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord;
Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord."
354;Joy Unspeakable;Ab;"I have found His grace 
Is all complete,
He supplieth every need;
While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet,
I am free, yes free indeed.

CHORUS
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Oh, the half has never yet been told.

I have found the pleasure 
I once craved,
It is joy and peace within;
What a wondrous blessing! 
I am saved
From the awful guilt of sin.

I have found that hope 
So bright and clear,
Living in the realm of grace;
Oh, the Savior's presence is so near,
I can see His smiling face.

I have found the joy 
No tongue can tell,
How its waves of glory roll!
It is like a great o'erflowing well,
Springing up within my soul."
355;Higher Ground;Ab;"I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as I'm onward bound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

CHORUS
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on Heaven's table land,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell 
Where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till heaven I've found,
Lord, lead me on to higher ground."
356;In the Twinkling of an Eye;Bb;"When the trump of the great archangel
Its mighty tones shall sound,
And, the end of the world proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of man shall come in His glory,
With all the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies 
     from the multitudes that rise,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Chorus
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
The trumpet shall sound, the dead 
     shall be raised,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

When He comes in the clouds descending,
And they who loved Him here,
From their graves shall awake and praise Him
With joy and not with fear;
When the body and the soul are united,
And clothed no more to die,
What a shouting there will be 
     when each other's face we see,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Oh the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in pow'r
And the songs of the blood-bought millions 
Shall hail that blissful hour;
When we gather safely home in the morning,
And night's dark shadows fly,
What a shouting on the shore
     when we meet to part no more,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye."
357;Break Thou The Bread Of Life;C;"Break Thou the bread of life,
Dear Lord to me,
As Thou didst break
The loaves beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page,
I seek Thee Lord;
My spirit pants for Thee,
Oh living Word!

Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord
To me, To me,
As Thou didst bless
The bread by Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My All in All.

Teach me to live, dear Lord,
Only for Thee,
As Thy disciples lived in Galilee;
Then, all my struggles o'er,
Then, victory won,
I shall behold Thee, Lord,
The living One."
358;Rock of Ages;Ab;"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee."
359;Signs Are Everywhere;Bb;"The King is coming in glory 
To catch His bride away,
It may be in the morning  
It may be at mid-day, 
At the even or midnight; 
The trump will sound so clear,
The dead in Christ, and we that live,
His voice shall hear.

Chorus
The King is coming, hallelujah! 
He's coming in the air,
The fig tree is budding, 
The signs are everywhere,
The saints are looking ever up-ward
While jour'ning on their way, 
He's coming, hallelujah!
To catch his bride away.

Behold! He cometh, and leaping  
And skipping o'er the hills;
Like the young roe, like the young hart, 
My soul with rapture thrills; 
Thru the window He's looking,
Thru the lattice-work is seen, 
The winter's past, the rain is o'er, 
The figs are green.

The King is coming , ""Be ready,""  
To meet Him on that day;
With your heart right, 
     with your robes white,
And in this holy way;  
Like the light'ning that flashes
In the twinkling of an eye, 
Our Lord shall come to claim His own
He's drawing nigh."
360;I Remember Calvary;Eb;"Where He may lead me, I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him so,
And I remember 'twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

CHORUS
Jesus shall lead me night and day,
Jesus shall lead me all the way,
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

Oh, I delight in His command,
Love to be lead by His dear hand;
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.

Onward I go, no doubt, nor fear,
Happy with Christ my Savior near,
Trusting that I some day shall see,
Jesus, my Friend of Calvary."
361;Close To Thee;F;"Thou, my everlasting portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior let me walk with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior let me walk with Thee.

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Nor for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me through the vale of shadows,
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee."
362;Cleanse Me;F;"Search me, Oh God, 
And know my heart today;
Try me, Oh Savior, 
Know my thoughts, I pray:
See if there be some wicked 
     way in me:
Cleanse me from every sin, 
     and set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing 
     me from sin:
Fulfill Thy Word, and make me 
     pure within:
Fill me with fire where once 
I burned with shame:
Grant my desire to magnify 
     Thy name.

Lord take my life, and make it 
     wholly Thine:
Fill my poor heart with 
Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, 
     self and pride;
I now surrender: Lord in me abide.

Oh, Holy Ghost, revival comes 
     from Thee:
Send a revival, 
Start the work in me:
Thy Word declares, 
Thou wilt supply our need:
For blessing now, Oh Lord, 
     I humbly plead."
363;He Rolled the Sea Away;C;"When Israel out of bondage came,
A sea before them lay;
The Lord reach'd down 
    His mighty hand,
And rolled the sea away.

Chorus
Then forward still, 
    'tis Jehovah's will, 
Tho' the billows dash and spray,
With a conq'ring tread 
    we will push ahead
He'll roll the sea away.

Before me was a sea of sin,
So great I feared to pray;
My heart's desire the Savior read,
And rolled the sea away.

When sorrows dark, like stormy waves,
Were dashing o'er my way,
Again the Lord in mercy came, 
And rolled the sea away.

And when I reach the sea of death,
For needed grace I'll pray;
I know the Lord will quickly come,
And roll the sea away."
364;Oh That Will Be Glory;F;"When all my labors and trials are o'er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

CHORUS
Oh that will be glory for me,
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace 
I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.

When by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in Heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Friends will be there 
I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Savior, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me."
365;We'll Understand It Better By And By;F;"We are often tossed and driven
On the restless sea of time,
Somber skies and howling tempests
Oft succeed a bright sunshine,
In that land of perfect day,
When the mists have rolled away,
We will understand it better by and by.

CHORUS
By and by when the morning comes,
When the saints of God are gathered home,
We will tell the story how we've overcome;
For we'll understand it better by and by.

We are often destitute
Of the things that life demands,
Want of food, want of shelter,
Thirsty hills and barren lands,
We are trusting in the Lord,
And according to His Word,
We will understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares
Often take us unawares,
And our hearts are made to bleed
For many thoughtless word or deed,
And we wonder why the test
When we try to do our best,
But we'll understand it better by and by."
366;He Was Nailed To The Cross For Me;Eb;"What a wonderful, wonderful Savior,
Who would die on the cross for me!
Freely shedding His precious life blood,
That the sinner might be made free.

CHORUS
He was nailed to the cross for me,
He was nailed to the cross for me;
On the cross crucified, for me He died;
He was nailed to the cross for me.

Thus He left His heavenly glory
To accomplish His Father's plan;
He was born of the Virgin Mary,
Took upon Him the form of man.

He was wounded  for our transgressions,
And He carried our sorrows, too;
He's the Healer of every sickness,
This He came to the world to do.

So He gave His life for others
In redeeming this world from sin,
And He's gone to prepare a mansion,
That at last we may enter in."
367;Redeemed;Ab;"Redeemed how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child and forever, I am.

CHORUS
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night."
368;God Leads Us Along;Eb;"In shady green pastures, 
     so rich and sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water's cool flow 
Bathes the weary one's feet,
God leads His dear children along.

CHORUS
Some thro' the waters, 
Some thro' the flood,
Some thro' the fire, 
But all thro' the blood;
Some thro' great sorrow, 
But God gives a song;
In the night season 
And all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount 
Where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley 
In the darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

Tho' sorrows befall us, 
And Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, 
Defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.

Away from the mire, 
And away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity's day.
God leads His dear children along."
369;He Brought Me Out;C;"My heart was distressed 
'Neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins 
Dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord 
From the deep, miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out 
     to golden day.

CHORUS
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah.

He placed me upon 
The strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established 
     and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling 
While here I remain,
But stand by His grace 
Until the crown I gain.

He gave me a song, 
'Twas a new song of praise,
By day and by night 
Its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing, 
I'm happy and free,
I'll praise my Redeemer, 
Who has rescued me.

I'll sing of His wonderful 
     mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men 
His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation 
At home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth 
And trust in God.

I'll tell of the pit, 
With its gloom and despair,
I'll praise the dear Father, 
Who answered my prayer;
I'll sing my new song, 
The glad story of love,
Then join in the chorus 
With the saints above."
370;Beneath The Cross Of Jesus;C;"Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the 
     noonday heat,
And the burden of the day.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart 
     with tears,
Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love
And my own worthlessness.

I take, Oh cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross."
371;Like a Mighty Sea;F;"My soul today is thirsting 
     for living streams divine,
To sweep from highest heaven 
     to this poor heart of mine;
I stand upon the promise, 
     in Jesus' name I plead;
Oh send the gracious current
     to satisfy my need.

Chorus
Like a mighty sea,
      like a mighty sea,
Comes the love of Jesus, 
     sweeping over me;
The waves of glory roll,
     the Savior to extol,
Comes the love of Jesus,
     sweeping o'er my soul.

I see the clouds arising,
     the mercy clouds of love,
That come to bring refreshing
   down from the throne above,
The earnest of the shower,
     just now to us is giv'n,
And now we wait, expecting 
     the floods of grace from heav'n.

The show'rs of grace are falling,
     the tide is rolling in,
The flood-tide of salvation,
     with pow'r to cleanse from sin;
It's surging thro' my being 
     and takes my sin away,
It keeps me shouting glory!
     thro' all the happy day.

It's coming, yes, it's coming,
     it's coming down this hour,
A torrent of salvation  
     in saving cleansing pow'r.
I hear the billows surging,
     I see them mount and roll;
Oh glory, hallelujah!
     they're sweeping thro' my soul."
372;Glory To His Name;F;"Down at the cross 
Where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing 
From sin I cried;
There to my heart 
Was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

CHORUS
Glory to His name!
Glory to His name!
There to my heart 
Was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

I am so wondrously 
Saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly 
Abides within,
There at the cross 
Where He took me in;
Glory to His name!

Oh, precious fountain 
That saves from sin!
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me 
And keeps me clean;
Glory to His name!

Come to this fountain 
So rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul 
At the Savior's feet;
Plunge in today 
And be made complete;
Glory to His name!"
373;It Is Mine;Bb;"God's abiding peace 
Is in my soul today,
Yes, I feel it now,
Yes, I feel it now;
He has taken all my 
Doubts and fears away,
Though I cannot tell you how.

CHORUS
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
He has given peace, 
Perfect peace to me;
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
Mine for all eternity!

He has wrought in me 
A sweet and perfect rest,
In my raptured heart 
I can feel it now;
He each passing moment 
Keeps me saved and blest,
Floods with light 
My heart and brow.

He has given me 
A never failing joy,
Oh, I have it now! 
Oh, I have it now!
To His praise I will my 
Ransomed pow'rs employ,
And renew my grateful vow.

Oh, the love of God 
Is comforting my soul,
For His love is mine, 
Yes, His love is mine!
Waves of joy and gladness 
O'er my spirit roll,
Thrilling me with life divine."
374;Builded on the Rock;F;"I builded on the Rock,
On the Rock of God,
Builded on the Rock,Christ Jesus;
I dug down deep 
And builded on the Rock,
Builded on the Rock of God.

Chorus
I hold not the Rock,
But the Rock holds me
The Rock holds me, 
The Rock holds me;
I rest on the Rock,
And the Rock holds me,
Resting on the Rock of God.

Why should I fear 
When the winds sweep by?
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Or shaken be when 
The waves roll high?
Builded on the Rock of God.

Hush, raging billows at His command, 
Builded of the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Oh, peace be still 'neath 
His loving hand!
Builded on the Rock of God.

Praise God for our foundation sure! 
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
No storms can harm our house secure,
Builded on the Rock of God."
375;At Calvary;C;"Years I spent in vanity 
     and pride,
Caring not my Lord 
     was crucified,
Knowing not it was for 
     me He died
On Calvary.

CHORUS
Mercy there was great, 
     and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied 
     to me;
There my burdened soul 
     found liberty,
At Calvary.

By God's Word at last my 
     sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law 
     I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring 
     turned
To Calvary.

Now I've given to Jesus 
     everything,
Now I gladly own Him as 
     my King,
Now my raptured soul can 
     only sing
Of Calvary.

Oh, the love that drew 
     salvation's plan!
Oh, the grace that brought 
      it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that 
     God did span
At Calvary!"
376;My Burdens Rolled Away;F;"I remember when my burdens 
     rolled away,
I had carried them for years, 
Night and day;
When I sought the blessed Lord, 
And I took Him at His Word,
Then at once all 
My burdens rolled away.

CHORUS
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away;
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away.

I remember when 
My burdens rolled away,
That I feared would never leave 
Night or day;
Jesus showed to me the loss, 
So I left them at the cross,
I was glad when 
My burdens rolled away.

I am singing since 
My burdens rolled away,
There's a song within my heart 
Night and day;
I am living for my King, 
And with joy I shout and sing
Hallelujah! all 
My burdens rolled away."
377;Bring Them In;F;"Hark, 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who've gone astray
Far from the Shepherd's fold away.

CHORUS
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring the wandering ones to Jesus.

Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wandering ones to find?
Who'll bring the lost ones the fold,
Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountains wild and high,
Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee,
""Go find My sheep where'er they be."""
378;Jesus Paid It All;Eb;"I hear the Savior say,
""Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.""

CHORUS
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
""Jesus died my soul to save,""
My lips shall still repeat."
379;Friendship With Jesus;C;"A friend of Jesus, oh, what bliss
That one so weak as I
Should ever have a friend 
     like this
To lead me to the sky.

CHORUS
Friendship with Jesus,
Fellowship divine;
Oh, what blessed sweet 
     communion,
Jesus is a friend of mine.

A friend when other friendships 
      cease,
A friend when others fail;
A friend who gives me joy 
     and peace,
A friend who will prevail.

A friend to lead me in the dark,
A friend who knows the way;
A friend to steer my weak, 
     frail bark,
A friend my debts to pay.

A friend when sickness lays 
     me low,
A friend when death draws near;
A friend as through the vale I go,
A friend to help and cheer.

A friend when life's rough 
     voyage is o'er.
A friend when death is past;
A friend to greet on heaven's 
     shore,
A friend when home at last."

Weary heart He calls you, 
""Come to me and rest,""
Does the path grow rugged?

Leave the unknown future
     in the Master's hands,
Whether sad or joyful,
Jesus understands."

Chorus
Where the healing waters flow
Where the joys celestial glow,
Oh, there's peace and rest and love,
Where the healing waters flow!

Now with Jesus crucified,
At his feet I'm resting low;
Let me evermore abide
Where the healing waters flow.

Whiter than the driven snow,
Now I sing my sweet refrain,
Where the healing waters flow."
383;My Sheep Know My Voice;Ab;"My sheep know my voice
And the path that I take,
They follow wherever I go;

And come at my call,
But a stranger's voice do they
     not know.

CHORUS
My sheep know my voice
And day by day
They abide in the fold
And go not astray;
They love me because
I have made them my choice
And they follow my call
For my sheep know my voice.

My sheep know my voice
And the pastures of green
Where I lead them so often to feed;
My sheep know my voice and the
     cool sparkling stream
Where beside its still waters I lead.

My sheep know my voice
And the valley of death
Through which I shall lead them
     some day;
But no danger nor harm can touch
     one of them
For I will be with them alway."

Life and rest, and joy and peace.

Oh ye righteous,
Your perfect redemption is nigh;
Swiftly the darkness of midnight approaches,
""He cometh,"" shall sound from the sky.
Long has the battle been waged against evil
By suffering saints here below.
Jesus is coming to banish our sorrow,
And lead us where tears never flow.

Come, dear Lord Jesus. 
Thy promise fulfilling;
""Come quickly!"" our souls cry to Thee:
Long has the world been enthralled 
     by the tempter,
The curse is on land and on sea.
Yet Thou shalt triumph, the nations subduing,
The truth of the Word cannot fail;
God's wondrous glory, like ocean's deep billows,
To earth's farthest bounds shall prevail."

Beautiful visions of glory I see;
Jesus in brightness revealed unto me.

And the labor ended,
We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves.

Going forth with weeping,
Sowing for the Master,
Though the loss sustained 
Our spirit often grieves;
When our weeping's over,
He will bid us welcome,
We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves."

Chorus
""Hold the fort, for I am coming,""

Satan leading on;
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone!

See the glorious banner waving!
Hear the trumpet blow!

Over ev'ry foe.

Onward comes our great Commander.
Cheer, my comrades, cheer."

We shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown,
And when the battle's over
We shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

Must I be carried to the skies,
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed the bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?

Sure, I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord:
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word."
390;He Took My Sins Away;Ab;"I came to Jesus,

The load of sin 
Was more than I could bear,
He took them all away,
He took them all away.
And now on Him 
I roll my every care,
He took my sins away.

No condemnation 
Have I in my heart,
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.
His perfect peace 
He did to me impart,
He took my sins away.

If you will come 
To Jesus Christ today,
He'll take your sins away,
He'll take your sins away.
And keep you happy 
In His love each day,
He'll take your sins away."

Never fear, He will surely answer:
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Now burst on my sight;
Angels, descending, 
Bring from above,
Echoes of mercy, 
Whispers of love.

Perfect submission, 
All is at rest!
I, in my Savior, 
Am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, 
Looking above,
Filled with His goodness, 
Lost in His love."
393;Jesus Opened up the Way;Ab;"Jesus Christ the Lord 
Opened up the way to glory
When He died to save us 
From our ruined state.
And He asks that we shall go
Tell the world the story,
How His blood will save them
From their awful fate.

Chorus
Jesus opened up 
The way to heaven's gate
When He died on the cross
To redeem all the lost;
He prepared the road 
That leads to His abode,
'Tis a road, marked by blood
But it leads us home to God.

And the way is marked
By the foot-prints of the Savior,
With His blood He made it,
Made it plain and straight;
If you walk that way,
It will lead you into heaven,
Lead you safely into 
Glory's golden gate.

Sinner, will you come and join
      in this heav'nly journey,
Walk the bloody pathway 
That the Savior trod;
Then when life is over 
And all the sheaves are garnered,
You will meet the Savior 
     and be not afraid."
394;Master, the Tempest Is Raging;C;"Master, the tempest is raging! 
The billows are tossing high!

How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

Chorus

Peace, be still!""

Or demons or men or whatever it be,

The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, be still! Peace be still! 
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, peace, be still!

Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
O waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul!
And I perish! I perish, dear Master; 
O hasten and take control!

Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast.
Linger, O blessed Redeemer, 
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
And rest on the blissful shore."

Who shed His precious blood
To restore a world 
To happiness and God;

Who for Adam's race 
Paid such a fearful price;

The Paschal Lamb of God,
For the world received 
""Redemption thro' His blood.""

""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
Let men and angels sing, 
""Worthy is the Lamb,""

Draw me nearer, nearer, 
     nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now, 
    to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up 
    with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour,
That before Thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer, 
    and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love 
    that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy 
    that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee."
397;Blessed Be The Fountain;C;"Blessed be the fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God:
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Though I've wandered far from His fold,

And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than the snow,
Whiter than the snow;
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o'ercame;
Grievous were the sorrows he bore,
But He suffered thus not in vain.
May I to that fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below;
Wash me in the blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me-
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."
398;I Need Thee Every Hour;Ab;"I need Thee every hour,

Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

I need Thee every hour,
Most holy one;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son."
399;Launch Out;C;"The mercy of God is an ocean divine,
A boundless and fathomless flood;
Launch out in the deep, cut away
     the shoreline,
And be lost in the fullness of God,

Chorus
Launch out into the deep,
Oh, let the shoreline go,
Launch out, launch out in the
     ocean divine,
Out where the full tides flow.

But many, alas! only stand 
    on the shore
And gaze on the ocean so wide;
They never have ventured its 
    depths to explore,
Or to launch on the fathomless tide.

And others just venture away 
    from the land,
And linger so near to the shore,
That the surf and the slime
      that beat over the strand,
Dash o'er them in floods evermore.


Oh,let us launch out on this
     ocean so broad,
Where the floods of salvation e'er flow;
Oh, let us be lost in the mercy of God,
Till the depths of His fullness we know."

Savior, Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Let me at a throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit, 
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heav'n but Thee?"

     took away my sin
I have had the sunlight of His love within.

Tho' clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows 'round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul.

While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigour on,
And leave the world behind.

I cross the wide-extended fields,
I journey o'er the plain,
And in the sunlight of His love
I reap the golden grain.

Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The Light that came to me;
Behold the brightness of His face,
Thro'out eternity."

Oh the children of the Lord have
     a right to shout and sing,
For the way is growing bright

We are lost amid the rapture
     of redeeming love;

We are going to a palace
     that is built of gold;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
Where the King in all His splendor
     we shall soon behold:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

There we'll shout redeeming mercy
     in a glad, new song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
There we'll sing the praise of Jesus
     with the blood-washed throng:
Glory to God, hallelujah!"

CHORUS
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will over-spread the sky;
But when trav'ling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev'ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold."
404;What, Never Thirst Again?;Bb;"There flows from Calvary a stream
For every sinner's pain,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never thirst again.

Chorus
What! never thirst again?
No, never thirst again;
What! never thirst again? 
No, never thirst again,
For he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

Earth's fountains fair,
But mock our souls,
Like desert phantoms lure,
And they that drink,the fainter grow,
The keener thirst endure.

This stream from Calvary still flows,
To bless and cleanse and heal,

Oh, balm for ev'ry pain! 
To thee I haste, for Jesus said,
I'll never thirst again."

CHORUS
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

Tho' they are slighting Him,
Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried
That grace can restore:
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken
Will vibrate once more.

Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor
The Lord will provide:
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand'rer
     a Savior has died."

Sometimes where Eden's 
     bowers bloom,
By waters still, 
O'er troubled sea,
Still 'tis His hand 
That leadeth me!

Lord, I would clasp 
Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content, whatever lot I see, 
Since 'tis my God

He's fairer than the lily, 
      brighter than the morning star;
He fills and satisfies
      my longing spirit o'er and o'er;
Each day He grows still sweeter 
      than He was the day before.

My heart is sometimes heavy,
      but He comes with sweet relief;
He folds me to His bosom 
      when I droop with blighting grief;
I love the Christ who all my burdens

Each day He grows still sweeter 
      than He was the day before."

My Savior stands between;
He stands to shield me from danger,
When earthly friends are gone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

When in affliction's valley
I'm treading the road of care;
My Savior helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet, entangled with briars
Ready to cast me down,
My Savior whispers His promise, 
""I never will leave thee alone.""

He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side;
For me He opened the fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He's waiting in glory,
Seated upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone."

And all my idols torn from my heart, 
And now He keeps me by His power.
Though all the world forsake me, 
And Satan tempts me sore,
Through Jesus I shall 
Safely reach the goal;

He will never, never leave me, 
Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith 
And do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, 
I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He 
My hungry soul shall fill.
Then sweeping up to glory, 
To see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll!"

Happy in His love and grace,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Here the sky is always bright;
'Tis no place for gloomy 
     Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music

Just outside my mansion door,
Where I'm living on the hallelujah side."

We are not divided, 
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never 
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, 
Which can never fail.

Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song;

He knew what God had said,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Daniel prayed unto the Lord 
     thrice each day,
Then unto the lion's den led the way;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He did not fear or dread,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Often with the carnal mind I was tried,
Asking for deliverance oft I cried;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I reckoned I was dead,
By faith I saw the victory ahead.

When like those who've gone before 
     to that land,
By death's river cold and dark 
     I shall stand;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I will not fear or dread,
By faith I see the victory ahead."

To paths I do not know,
I'll answer dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I'll go where you want me to go.

I'll go where you want me to go , dear Lord
O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord,

Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand'rer whom I should seek,
Oh Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide, 
Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I'll say what you want me to say.

There's surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth's harvest-fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life's short day
For Jesus, the Crucified.
So, trusting my all unto Thy care, 
I know Thou lovest me!
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what you want me to be."

Rest beyond the river.

Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."

Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

Give us the promised Holy Ghost,
We want another Pentecost,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

God of Elijah, hear our cry,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
He'll make us fit to live or die,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
To burn up every trace of sin,
To bring the light and glory in,

433;Throw Out The Life-Line;F;"Throw out the Life-Line 
Across the dark wave,
There is a brother 
Whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother! 
Oh, who then will dare
To throw out the Life-Line, 
His peril to share?

Chorus
Throw out the Life-Line! 
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is drifting away!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is sinking today.

Throw out the Life-Line 
With hand quick and strong;
Why do you tarry, 
Why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; 
Oh hasten today
And out with the Life-Boat! 
Away, then, away!

Throw out the Life-Line 
To danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish 
Where you've never been;
Winds of temptation 
And billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out 
Where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season 
Of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift 
To eternity's shore;
Haste then,my brother, 
No time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line 
And save them today."
434;Our Lord's Return To Earth Again;F;"I am watching for the coming 
Of the glad millennial day,
When our blessed Lord shall come

For  the Lord is coming back 
     to earth again.

After Jesus shall come back 
     to earth again.

Jesus' coming back will be the answer
To earth's sorrowing cry,
For the knowledge of the Lord shall fill
The earth and sea and sky;
God shall take away all sickness 
And the sufferer's tears will dry,
When our Savior shall come back 
     to earth again.

Yes, the ransomed of the Lord shall come 
To Zion then with joy,
And in all His holy mountain 
Nothing hurts or shall destroy;
Perfect peace shall reign in every heart,
     and love without alloy,
After Jesus shall come back 
     to earth again.

Then the sin and sorrow, pain and death
     of  this dark world shall cease,
In a glorious reign with Jesus of a
     thousand years of peace;
All the earth is groaning, crying 
For that day of sweet release,
For our Jesus to come back 
     to earth again."

Keep me, Savior, from day to day,
Under the precious blood.

Here Jesus makes salvation known,
Under the precious blood.

Lord, with Thy self my spirit fill,
Under the blood, under the blood;
And work in me to do Thy will,
Under the precious blood.

Sweet peace abides within the heart,
Under the blood ,under the blood;
And gifts divine their joy impart,
Under the precious blood.

Under the blood, under the blood;
Exerts His sanctifying power,
Under the precious blood."
436;The Message of His Coming;Bb;"We're looking for His coming,
      in the clouds of heaven,
Coming back to earth 
      to catch away His own;
Then may we all be ready, 
      when midnight cry is given,
To go and reign with Christ 
      on His throne.

Chorus
Gladly may we herald the message 
Of His blessed appearing,
Soon He's coming in glory, 
Tell to one and all;
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, 
Why slumber when the end is nearing,
But get ready for the final call.

We're longing for the glory 
     that awaits the faithful,
Who shall overcome, 
     and ev'ry conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward, 
     the prize is life eternal
To all who win the fight over sin.

We're praying for the advent 
      of our blessed Savior,
Who has promised life 
      to all who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending, 
      the message being given,
And soon we'll see our Lord 
      face to face.

We see the signs appearing 
      of His blessed coming,
Lo, behold the fig leaves 
      now becoming green;
The gospel of His kingdom 
      has gone to ev'ry nation;
That we are near the end 
      can be seen."

Wonderful words of Life.
Jesus, only Savior,
Sanctify forever:"
438;Yes, I Know!;F;"Come, ye sinners, lost and hopeless,
Jesus' blood can make you free;
For He saved the worst among you,
When He saved a wretch like me.

CHORUS
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' blood can make the 
     vilest sinner clean.
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' blood can make the 
     vilest sinner clean.

To the faint He giveth power,
Through the mountains makes a way;
Findeth water in the desert,
Turns the night to golden day.

In temptation He is near thee,
Holds the powers of hell at bay;
Guides you to the path of safety,
Gives you grace for every day.

He will keep thee while the ages
Roll throughout eternity;
Though earth hinders and hell rages,
All must work for good to thee."
439;Hiding In Thee;Eb;"Oh safe to the Rock
That is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts
And sorrows would fly;
So sinful, so weary, Thine,
Thine would I be;
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

CHORUS
Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noontide,
In sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation
Casts o'er me its power;
In the tempests of life,
On its wide heaving sea,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict,
When pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and
Breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials
Like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee,
Oh Thou Rock of my soul."
440;My Savior's Love;F;"I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.

CHORUS
How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!

For me it was in the garden
He prayed, ""Not My will, but Thine,""
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me."
441;Tell Me The Old, Old Story;C;"Tell me the old,  old story 
Of unseen things above;
Of Jesus and His glory,  
Of Jesus and His love.
Tell me the story simply, 
As to a little child,
For I am weak and weary, 
And helpless and defiled.

CHORUS
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story softly, 
That I may take it in,
That wonderful redemption,  
God's remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often, 
For I forget so soon,
The early dew of morning, 
Has passed away at noon.

Tell me the same old story 
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory 
Is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world's glory 
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell  me the old, old story: 
Christ Jesus makes thee whole."

     worldly strife;
Come, feast upon the love of God,
And drink everlasting life."
443;I've Anchored In Jesus;Ab;"Upon life's boundless ocean 
Where mighty billows roll,
I've fixed my hope in Jesus, 
Blest anchor of my soul;
When trials fierce assail me 
As storms are gathering o'er,
I rest upon His mercy 
And trust Him more.

CHORUS
I've anchored in Jesus, 
The storms of life I'll brave,
I've anchored in Jesus, 
I fear no wind or wave,
I've anchored in Jesus, 
For He hath power to save,
I've anchored to the Rock of Ages.

He keeps my soul from evil 
And gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters 
And bid their tumult cease;
My pilot and deliverer, 
To Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him, 
He's at my side,

He is my Friend and Savior, 
In Him my anchor's cast,
He drives away my sorrows 
And shields me from the blast;
By faith I'm looking upward 
Beyond life's troubled sea,
There I behold a haven 
Prepared for me."
444;My Redeemer;Ab;"I will sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

CHORUS
Sing, oh, sing, of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell

I will sing of my  Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be."
445;Let The Lower Lights Be Burning;Ab;"Brightly beams our Father's mercy
From His lighthouse evermore,
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.

CHORUS
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave!
Some poor fainting, struggling sea-man
You may rescue, you may save.

Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;
Some poor sailor tempest tossed,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost."
446;The Sure Foundation;F;"There stands a Rock on shores of time
That rears to heav'n its head sublime;
That Rock is cleft, and they are blest
Who find within this cleft a rest.

Chorus
Some build their hopes on the 
     ever drifting sand,
Some on their fame, or their treasure, 
     or their land;
Mine's on a Rock that forever will stand,
Jesus, the ""Rock of Ages.""

That Rock's a cross, its arms outspread,
Celestial glory bathes its head;
To its firm base my all I bring,
And to the Rock of Ages cling.

That Rock's a tow'r, whose lofty height,
Illum'd with heav'n's unclouded light,
Opes wide its gate beneath the dome
Where saints find rest with Christ at home."
447;Wonderful Peace;Ab;"Far away in the depths 
Of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody 
Sweeter than psalm;
In celestial like strains 
It unceasingly falls
O'er my soul 
Like an infinite calm.

CHORUS
Peace! peace! wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray
In fathomless billows of love.

What a treasure I have 
In this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul;
So secure that no power 
Can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll.

I am resting tonight 
In this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus' control;
For I'm kept from all danger 
By night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul.

And me thinks when I rise 
To that city of peace,
Where the author of peace 
I shall see,
That one strain of the song 
Which the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom shall be:

Ah! soul, are you here 
Without comfort or rest,
Marching down the rough 
Pathway of time?
Make Jesus your friend 
Ere the shadows grow dark;
Oh, accept this sweet 
Peace so sublime."
448;'Tis Burning In My Soul;C;"God sent His mighty power 
    to this poor, sinful heart,
To keep me every hour, 
    and needful grace impart;
And since His Spirit came, 
    to take supreme control,
The love enkindled flame 
    is burning in my soul.

CHORUS

The fire of heavenly love 
    is burning in my soul,
The Holy Spirit came, 
    all glory to His name!
The fire of heavenly love 
    is burning in my soul.

Before the cross I bow, 
    upon the altar lay
A willing offering now, 
    my all from day to day.
My Savior paid the price,  
    my name He sweetly calls;
Upon the sacrifice the fire 
    from heaven falls.

No good that I have done, 
    His promise I embrace;
Accepted in the Son, 
    He saves me by His grace.
All glory be to God! 
    let hallelujahs roll;
His love is shed abroad, 
    the fire is in my soul."
449;Leaning On The Everlasting Arms;F;"What a fellowship, 
What a joy divine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;

Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Oh, how sweet to walk 
In this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
Oh, how bright the path 
Grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

What have I to dread, 
What have I to fear,
Leaning on the everlasting arms?
I have blessed peace 
With my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms."

Since my life is free from sin,
Victory, victory.

Shout your freedom everywhere,
His eternal peace declare,
Victory, victory.
Let us sing it here below,
In the face of every foe,
Victory, victory.

We will sing it on that shore,
When this fleeting life is o'er,
Victory, victory.
Sing it here, ye ransomed throng,
Start the everlasting song:
Victory, victory."
451;His Yoke Is Easy;Ab;"The Lord is my Shepherd, 
I shall not want,
He maketh me down to lie
In pastures green, 
He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

CHORUS
His yoke is easy, 
His burden is light,
I've found it so, 
I've found it so;
He leadeth me 
By day and by night,
Where living waters flow.

My soul crieth out: 
""Restore me again,
And give me 
The strength to take
The narrow path 
     of righteousness,
E'en for Thine own 
     name's sake.""

Yea, though I should walk 
The valley of death,
Yet what should I fear from ill?
For Thou art with me and 
Thy rod and staff support me still."
452;Jesus Loves Even Me;F;"I am so glad that 
Our Father in heav'n
Tells of His love in the Book 
He has giv'n,
Wonderful things 
In the Bible I see;
This is the dearest 
That Jesus loves me.

CHORUS
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me:
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

Tho' I forget Him 
And wander away,
Still He doth love me 
Wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving 
Arms would I flee,
When I remember 
That Jesus loves me.

Oh, if there's only one 
Song I can sing,
When in His beauty 
I see the  great King,
This shall my song 
In eternity be:
""Oh, what a wonder 
That Jesus loves me.""

Jesus loves me,
And I know I love Him;
Love brought Him down
My poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was love made 
Him die on the tree;
Oh, I am certain that 
Jesus loves me!

If one should ask of me, 
How can I tell?
Glory to Jesus, 
I know very well!
God's Holy Spirit 
With mine doth agree,
Constantly witnessing 
Jesus loves me.

In this assurance 
I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus, 
I know I am blessed;
Satan, dismayed, from my 
Soul now doth flee,
When I just tell him that
Jesus loves me."

Free from its toil and care,
Heavenly joys to share,

This is my pray'r.

Beautiful things on high,
Over in yonder sky,
Thus I shall leave this shore,
Counting my treasures o'er;

Carry me by and by,
Never to sorrow more,
Heavenly shore."

O what words I hear him say!
Happy place! so near, so precious!
May it find me there each day;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
I would look upon the past;
For His love has been so gracious,
It has won my heart at last.

Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Where can mortal be more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And, when weary, find sweet rest;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
There I love to weep and pray,
While I from his fullness gather
Grace and comfort every day.

Bless me, oh my Savior, bless me,
As I sit low at Thy feet;
Oh look down in love upon me,
Let me see Thy face so sweet,
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
Make me holy as He is;
May I prove I've been with Jesus,
Who is all my righteousness."

It speaks! polluted nature dies!
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

I rise to walk in heav'n's own light
Above the world and sin,
With heart made pure, and 
     garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

Amazing grace! 'tis heav'n below
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus know,
My Jesus crucified."

No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

For my pardon this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my cleansing, this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus."

To God's holiness so clean,
Where there's death to self and sin,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I'm within the holiest pale,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the inner veil,
Oh glory be to God!
I am sanctified to God
By the power of the blood,
Now the Lord is my abode,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!"
458;Amazing Grace;F;"Amazing grace! 
     How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, 
     but now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught 
     my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did 
      that grace appear
The hour I first believed;

Thro' many dangers, 
      toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought 
      me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised 
    good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my shield 
    and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh 
    and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, 
    within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The world shall 
     soon to ruin go,
The sun refuse to shine;
But God, who called 
     me here below,
Shall be forever mine.

When we've been 
      there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days 
      to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

Praise God, Praise God

Praise God, Praise God, 
    Praise God.

Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light,
And the burdens of my heart, 
     rolled away,
It was there by faith, 
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day.

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
Tis all that I can do!"

I am meek and lowly,
Come and trust My might;
Come, My yoke is easy,
And My burden's light.

Are you disappointed, 
      wand'ring here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt 
      and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle
      in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus, 
He will give you rest.

Stumbling on the mountains 
      dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling tow'rd the pit
      of hell's consuming flame,
By the pow'rs of sin 
      deluded and oppressed, 
Hear the tender Shepherd,
""Come to Me and rest.""

Have you by temptation 
      often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness 
      brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you, 
      if you'll claim His best,
In the Holy Spirit, 
He will give you rest."
461;Where He Leads Me;F;"I can hear my Savior calling,
I can hear my Savior calling,
 I can hear my Savior calling,
""Take thy cross and follow,
     follow Me.""

CHORUS
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
And go with me, with me all the way."
462;I Know Whom I Have Believed;C;"I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

CHORUS
But I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day.

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus thro' the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air."
463;I Believe Jesus Saves;F;"I am coming to Jesus for rest,
Rest, such as the purified know;
My soul is athirst to be blest,
To be washed and made 
     whiter than snow.

CHORUS
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow;
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow.

In coming, my sin I deplore,
My weakness and poverty show;
I long to be saved evermore,
To be washed and made 
     whiter than snow.

To Jesus I give up my all,
Every treasure and idol I know;
For His fullness of blessing I call,
Till His blood washes 
     whiter than snow"
464;Sweet By And By;F;"There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

CHORUS
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days."
465;When I Survey;F;"When I survey the wondrous cross,
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all."
466;The Great Physician;Eb;"The great Physician now is near;
The sympathizing Jesus.
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus.

CHORUS
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

Your many sins are all forgiv'n,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to heav'n,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Savior's name,
I love the name of Jesus.

And when to that bright world above
We rise to be with Jesus,
We'll sing around the throne of love,
His name, the name of Jesus."
467;Oh Happy Day;F;"Oh happy day that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Savior and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

CHORUS
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away.

'Tis done, the great transaction's done;
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;
He drew me, and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

Now rest, my long-divided heart;
Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
Nor ever from my Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed."
468;The Old Account Settled;Ab;"There was a time on earth, 
When in the book of heaven
An old account was standing
For sins yet unforgiven;
My name was at the top, 
And many things below,
I went unto the keeper, 
And settled long ago.

CHORUS
Long ago, long ago, 
Yes the old account 
Was settled long ago;
And the record's clear today, 
For He washed my sins away,
When the old account 
Was settled long ago.

The old account was large, 
And growing every day,
For I was always sinning, 
And never tried to pay;
But when I looked ahead, 
And saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle,
I settled long ago.

When at the judgment bar, 
I stand before my King,
And He the book will open, 
He cannot find a thing;
Then will my heart be glad, 
While tears of joy will flow
Because I had it settled, 
And settled long ago.

When in that happy home, 
My Savior's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story, 
And praise Him for His love;
I'll not forget that book, 
With pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled, 
And settled long ago.

O sinner, seek the Lord, 
Repent of all your sin,
For thus He hath commanded, 
If you would enter in;
And then if you should live 
A hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it, 
You settled long ago."
469;Stand Up For Jesus;G;"Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
ye soldiers of the cross,
Lift high His royal banner, 
it must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory, 
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished 
and Christ is Lord  indeed.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict, 
in this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him, 
against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, 
and strength to strength oppose.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus; 
stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you - 
ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor, 
and watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger, 
be never wanting there."
470;Yesterday, Today, Forever;Ab;"Oh, how sweet the glorious message, 
     simple faith may claim;
Yesterday today, forever,
 Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful, 
     heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest; 
     Glory to His name!

CHORUS
Yesterday, today, forever, 
Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never! 
     Glory to His name,
Glory to His name, Glory to his name;
All may change but Jesus never! 
     Glory to His name.

He who was the friend of sinners, 
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at 
His footstool penitently bow.
He who said, ""I'll not condemn thee, 
     go and sin no more;""
Speaks to thee that word of pardon, 
     as in days of yore.

Oft on earth He healed the sufferer 
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows 
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue, 
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His fullness 
Still will give as much.

As of old He walked to Emmaus, 
      with them to abide;
So through all life's way He walketh, 
      ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him, 
     hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be this same Jesus, 
     as He went away."
471;Revive Us Again;F;"We praise Thee, O God, 
For the Son of Thy love, 
For Jesus who died
And is now gone above.

Chorus
Hallelujah! 
Thine the glory,
Hallelujah! amen; 
Hallelujah!
Thine the glory, 
Revive us again.

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior,
And scattered our night.

All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins
And has cleansed ev'ry stain.

Revive us again;
Fill each heart with Thy love,
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above."
472;Take The Name Of Jesus With You;F;"Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it, then, where'er you go.

CHORUS
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

Take the name of Jesus with you,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

Oh the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him
When our journey is complete."
473;Jesus Loves Me;C;"Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak but He is strong.

CHORUS
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin.
Let His little child come in.

Jesus loves me! loves me still,
Though I'm very weak and ill;
From His shining throne on high,
Comes to watch me where I lie.

Jesus loves me; He will stay
Close beside me all the way;
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high."
474;Look To The Lamb Of God;F;"If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God;
He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.

CHORUS
Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,
For He alone is able to save you;
Look to the Lamb of God.

When Satan tempts, 
and doubts and fears assail,
Look to the Lamb of God;
You in His strength 
Shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you aweary, 
Does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer 
And fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows 
On your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow 
Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God."
475;Blest Be The Tie That Binds;F;"Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, 
    our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again."
476;Sweet Hour Of Prayer;C;"Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear,
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
I view my home, and take my flight:
This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing thro' the air,
Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"
477;When They Ring The Golden Bells;Eb;"There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore 
By faith's decree;
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

CHORUS
Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee.
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

We shall know no sin nor sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond
    the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
When in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the spirit
    to be free
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Aiden,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me."
478;Jesus, Lover Of My Soul;F;"Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high!
Hide me, oh my Savior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:
Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me!
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, oh Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
False and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace."
479;Joy To The World!;C;"Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.

Joy to the world! the Savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills
    and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, and wonders of His love."

Late in time behold Him come,
Off-spring of a virgin's womb.

Hail th' incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with men to appear,
Jesus our Immanuel here.

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace,
Hail the Sun of righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Ris'n with healing in His wings:
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.

Come, Desire of nations, come!
Fix in us Thy humble home:
Rise, the woman's conqu'ring seed,
Bruise in us the serpent's head;
Adam's likeness now efface,
Stamp Thine image in its place:
Second Adam from above,
Reinstate us in Thy love."
482;Silent Night! Holy Night!;G;"Silent night! Holy night!
All is calm, all is bright 
'Round yon virgin mother and child,
Holy infant so tender and mild,

Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn or redeeming grace,

483;Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem;Eb;"Oh little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by:
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary;
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Oh holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend on us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today.
We hear the holy angels
The great glad tidings tell;
Oh come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel."
484;It Came Upon The Midnight Clear;Bb;"It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
From heaven's all-gracious King:""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still thro' the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
Oh rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing.

For lo, the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the evercircling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing."
485;Away In A Manger;F;"Away in a manger,
No crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus,
Asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing,
The Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
No crying He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle,
Till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever,
And love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And take us to heaven,
To live with Thee there."

Oh, why do you tarry so long?
Your Savior is waiting to give you
A place in His sanctified throng.

CHORUS
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?
Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?

What do you hope, dear brother,
To gain by a further delay?
There's no one to save you but Jesus.
There's no other way but His way;

Do you not feel, dear brother,
His Spirit now striving within?
Oh, why not accept His salvation,
And throw off your burden of sin?

Why do you wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Savior is longing to bless you;
There's danger and death in delay."

Calling today, calling today;
Why from the sunshine 
Of love wilt thou roam
Farther and farther away?

Out of life's storms and into Thy calm,
Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
Jesus, I come to Thee.

Out of unrest and arrogant pride,
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
Into Thy blessed will to abide,
Jesus, I come to Thee;
Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,
Out of despair into raptures above,
Upward for aye on wings like a dove,
Jesus, I come to Thee.

Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
Into the joy and light of Thy home,

Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
Jesus, I come to Thee."

Cleansed and made holy,
Humble and lowly,
Right in the sight of God?

O'er self and o'er sin
Is thy heart right with God?
Over all evil without and within?
Is thy heart right with God?

Is there no more 
Condemnation for sin?
Is thy heart right with God?
Does Jesus rule 
In the temple within?
Is thy heart right with God?

Are all thy pow'rs 
Under Jesus' control?
Is thy heart right with God?
Does He each moment 
Abide in thy soul?
Is thy heart right with God?

Art thou now walking 
In heaven's pure light?
Is thy heart right with God?
Is thy soul wearing 
the garment of white?
Is thy heart right with God?"

With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,

Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,

When trouble comes and there’s
no one around,
Satan, he tries to tell me that my
God let me down;
Through every dark hour the best
thing I’ve found,
It was to give God the thanks.
For He has never, never, never
failed me yet,
So why should I start now to worry

In everything I will never forget,
To give God the thanks."

I wonder, have I done my best
for Jesus,
When He has done so much for me?
The hours that I have wasted are
so many,

The hours I’ve spent for Christ so
few.
Because of all my lack of love for
Jesus,
I wonder if His heart is breaking
too?

I wonder, have I cared enough
for others,
Or have I let them die alone?
I might have helped a wanderer
to the Saviour;
The seed of precious Life I might
have sown.

No longer will I stay within the

I’ll climb to mountain heights
above
The world is dying now for want
of someone
To tell them of the Saviour’s
matchless love."

O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be
discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

In His arms He’ll take and shield
thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there."

Let me walk with You Jesus,
Don’t ever leave me alone,
For without You I could never,
No never make heaven my home.

blue,
You found me when no one
would love me,
And no one knew just what to do."
533;CLOSE TO THEE F;;"Thou, my everlasting portion,

You’re the Lily of my Valley,
You’re my Bright and Morning Star,

slain.

CHORUS
So I’ll cherish the old rugged
cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged
cross,
And exchange it some day for a
crown.

Oh, that old rugged cross, so
despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for
me;
For the dear Lamb of God left
His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In the old rugged cross, stained
with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see.
For ’twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

To the old rugged cross I will ever
be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly
bear;
Then He’ll call me some day to my
home far away,
Where His glory forever I’ll share."

Rest beyond the river.

Sheds its beams around me.

Hoping, trusting, ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."

The Blood that gives me strength
from day to day,

my fears,
And it dries all my tears;
The Blood that gives me strength
from day to day,
It shall never lose its power."

Saviour, Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,

Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

More than life to me,
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?"

Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father’s throne,
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims
are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in
heart,
And hope to meet again."

Jesus is a friend of mine.

A friend when other friendships cease,
A friend when others fail,
A friend who gives me joy and peace,
A friend when foes assail.

A friend when sickness lays me low,
A friend when death draws near,
A friend as thru the vale I go,
A friend to help and cheer.

A friend when life’s short race is o’er,
A friend when earth is past,
A friend to meet on Heaven's shore,
A friend when home at last."

Thy power and Thine alone,
Can change the leper’s spots,
And melt the heart of stone.

Since nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim,
I’ll wash my garments white,
In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb."

sorrow He died;
The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised and
rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary.

CHORUS
He was wounded for our
transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid,
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate’s judgement hall,
Now His suffering affords perfect
healing for all,
This wonderful Healer’s mine.

Came the leper to Christ, saying
""Surely I know,
That Thou, Lord, can’st make me
whole.""
When His great faith was seen,
Jesus said, ""Yes I will""
And touched him and made him
clean.

Made me every whit whole,
And He’ll do the same for you.
He’s the same yesterday and
today and forever,
This Healer of men today."

Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone,
Thou must save, and Thou alone.
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

To Thee, whose blood can cleanse
each spot,

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse,
relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,

There in the kingdom of glory
Never shall fall the night.

While here I wage the strife;
Then will the victors be given
Crowns of eternal life."

In various ways;
Troubles he had some,
But not from above,
God gave him His sign
On the wings of a dove.

CHORUS
On the wings of a snow-white
dove,
God sends down His pure sweet
love,
A sign from above,
On the wings of a dove.

Jesus, our Saviour
Came to earth one day;
He was born in a stable,
In a manger of hay;
Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign
On the wings of a dove.

Though I have suffered
In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;
Faith wasn’t forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign
On the wings of a dove."
571;JESUS, JESUS, JESUS D;;"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
There’s just something about that

Kings and kingdoms will all pass
away,
But there’s something about that
Name."
572;WHEN I SURVEY THE CROSS F;;"When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me
most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands,
His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled
down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature
mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all!"
573;MAGNIFY THE LORD D;;"I will bless the Lord at all times,
His praise will continue in my
mouth;
I will make my boast in the Lord,

Let us exalt His name together,
O come and magnify the Lord with
me,
Let us exalt His name together.

worship Him."

Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine;

Truly know that Thou art mine.

576;IF THAT ISN’T LOVE G;;"He left His splendour of heaven,
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely hill of Golgotha,
There to lay down His life for me.

CHORUS
If that isn’t love, the ocean is dry,
There’re no stars in the sky,
And the sparrows can’t fly,
If that isn’t love, then heaven’s a
myth;
There’s no feeling like this,
If that isn’t love.

Even in death He remembered,
The thief hanging by His side,
Then He spoke with love and
compassion,
Then took him to paradise."
577;HE LOOKED BEYOND C;;"Amazing grace, shall always be
my song of praise.
For it was grace that bought my
liberty.
I do not know just how He came to
love me so;
He looked beyond my faults and
saw my needs.

CHORUS
I shall forever lift my eyes to
Calvary;
To view the Cross where Jesus
died for me,
How marvelous! the grace, that
caught my fallen soul;
He looked beyond my faults and
saw my needs.

It was God’s grace that brought
me out of darkness,
And to the light where I can clearly
see,
I’ll shout it from the mountains and
the valleys;
He looked beyond my faults and
saw my needs."
578;I REMEMBER CALVARY C;;"Where He may lead me I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him
so,
And I remember ’twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

CHORUS
Jesus shall lead me night and day,
Jesus shall lead me all the way,
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

O I delight in His command,
Love to be led by His dear hand;
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained
Calvary.

Onward I go no doubt nor fear,
Happy with Christ my Saviour
near;
Trusting that I some day shall see,
Jesus my Friend of Calvary."

Upon that lonely night,
And wrestled there alone
Until the morning light;
He won a princely title
To gird him for the right;
I want that kind of blessing.

CHORUS
I want, I want that kind of
blessing,
That saves and keeps, and
satisfies the soul;
I want, I want that full salvation
’Til billows of heaven o’er me roll.

When Israel at last came
Into Canaan’s land,
The Lord His riches gave
So full on every hand;
They drove their foes before
them
And dwelt a happy band,
I want that kind of blessing.

This is the day of grace,
The Comforter is here,
We are a chosen race,
Our God is drawing near.
He’s waiting to be gracious
The prayer of faith to hear,
And then He’ll send the blessing."

Trust and obey, for there’s no
other way
To be happy in Jesus;
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love,
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favour He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear only trust and obey."

As Thou didst bless the bread by
Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My All in All.

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness seems to hide His
face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne."

635;IT'S DRIPPING WITH BLOOD D;;"The first one to die for this Holy
Ghost plan,
Was John the Baptist, but he died
like a man;
Then came the Lord Jesus, they
crucified Him,
He taught that the Spirit would
save men from sin.

CHORUS
It’s dripping with blood, yes,
It’s dripping with blood,
This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping
with blood,
The blood of disciples who died for
the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping
with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, and
John the divine,
They gave up their lives so this
Gospel could shine;
They mingled their blood, like the
prophets of old,
So the true Word of God could
honest be told.

Then they stoned Stephen, he
preached against sin,
He made them so angry, they
dashed his head in;
But he died in the Spirit, and gave
up the ghost,
And went to join others, in that
life-giving host.

There’re souls under the altar,
crying, ""How long?""
For the Lord to punish those
who’ve done wrong;
But there’s going to be more
who’ll give their life’s blood
For this Holy Ghost Gospel and its
crimson flood."

soldiers,
And face to face in stern array,
With armour gleaming and colors
streaming,
The right and wrong engage today;
The fight is on, but be not weary,
Be strong and in His might hold
fast;
If God be for us, His banner o’er
us,
We’ll sing the victor’s song at last.

The fight is on, arouse ye soldiers
brave and true,
Jehovah leads, and victory will
assure;
Go buckle on the armour God has
given you,
And in His strength unto the end
endure.

The Lord is leading on to certain

The bow of promise spans the

Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane;
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
’Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise,
Which can never fail.

At the sign of triumph,
Satan’s host doth flee;
Oh, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell’s foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise!

Onward, then, ye people!
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honour,
Unto Christ the King;
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing"

I’m so glad that I can say I’m one
of them.

CHORUS
One of them, one of them,
I am glad that I can say I’m one of
them;
One of them, one of them,
I’m so glad that I can say I’m one
of them.

Though these people may not
learned be,
Nor boast of worldly fame,
They have all received their
Pentecost,
Baptized in Jesus’ name;
And are telling now, both far and
wide,
His power is yet the same,
I’m so glad that I can say I’m one
of them.

They were gathered in the upper
room,
All praying in His name,
They were baptized with the Holy
Ghost,
And pow’r for service came;
Now what He did for them that day
He’ll do for you the same,
I’m so glad that I can say I’m one
of them.

Come, my brother, seek this
blessing
That will cleanse your heart from
sin,
That will start the joy-bells ringing
And will keep the soul aflame;
It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His name,

There is but one way to enter in it,
Just as they did on Pentecost.

CHORUS
Are you in the Church triumphant?
Are you in the Saviour’s Bride?
Come and be baptized into the Body,
And forevermore abide.

There is but one Church, Bride or
Body,
And into it we’re all baptized;
By the one, true, promised Holy
Spirit;
Though by the world we’re all
despised.

Every creed has claimed to be the
Body,
But the ""plumb line"" proved untrue
All their dreams, for God has so
determined
To bring His Son’s true Bride to view.

Many thought that they were in the
Body,
’Till the Holy Ghost had come;
When the Word of God was
opened to them,
They entered in, and yet there’s
room.

Those who died before the Holy
Spirit
came upon us from on high,
May, by faith with saints of old
departed,
Arise to meet Him in the sky.

When the Bridegroom comes,
will you be ready;
And your vessel all filled and bright?
You will be among the foolish virgins
If you do not walk in the light."

To keep that which I’ve committed
Unto Him against that day.""

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I’ll walk the vale with Him,
Or ""meet Him in the air."""

CHORUS
When He reached down His hand
for me,
When He reached down His hand
for me;
I was lost and undone, without
God or His Son,
When He reached down His hand
for me, for me.

I was nearing despair, when He
came to me there,
And He showed me that I could be
free;
Then He lifted my feet, gave me
glory complete,
When He reached down His hand
for me, for me.

How my heart doth rejoice since I
made Him my choice,
From the tempest to Him now I
flee;
Now I lean on His arm, I’m secure
from all harm,
Since He reached down His hand
for me, for me.

Since the Lord gave me peace,
Heavenly joys never cease;
Lord, I give all my life unto Thee;
Guide my feet, hold my hand,
grant with Thee I may stand,
For You reached down Your hand
for me, for me."

the day, oh, yes.

CHORUS
There will be peace in the valley

There will be peace in the valley
for me, oh, Lord, I pray;
There’ll be no sadness, no sorrow,
no trouble I’ll see;
There will be peace in the valley
for me.

There the flow’rs will be looming,
And the grass will be green;
And the skies will be clear and
serene, oh, yes;
Well the sun ever beams, in this
valley of dreams;
And no clouds there will ever be
seen, oh, yes.

Well, the bear will be gentle, and
the wolf will be tame;
And the Lion shall lay down by the
Lamb, oh, yes;
Well the beast from the wild, shall
be led by a little child;
And I’ll be changed, changed from
this creature that I am, oh, yes."

How great Thou art, how great
Thou art!

When through the woods and
forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in
the trees;
When I look down from lofty
mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the
gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, His
Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take
it in;
That on the cross, my burden
gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my
sin.

When Christ shall come with shout
of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall
fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble
adoration
And there proclaim, my God, how
great Thou art!"
658;THE HAVEN OF REST F;;"My soul in sad exile
Was out on life’s sea,
So burdened with sin and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice saying,
""Make Me your choice;""
And I entered the ""Haven of Rest!""

CHORUS
I've anchored my soul in the haven
of rest,
I’ll sail the wild seas no more;
The tempest may sweep o’er the
wild, stormy deep,
In Jesus I’m safe evermore.

I yielded myself to His tender
embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, and I anchored
my soul;
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul,
Since the Lord made me whole,
Has been the old story, so blest,
Of Jesus, who’ll save whosoever
will have
A home in the ""Haven of Rest!""

How precious the thought that we
all may recline,
Like John, the beloved and blest,
On Jesus’ strong arm,
Where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the ""Haven of Rest!""

O come to the Saviour,
He patiently waits,
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul in the
haven of rest
And say, ""My Beloved is mine."""
659;HE IS LORD F;;"He is Lord, He is Lord (I praise His Name)
He has risen from the dead and
He is Lord,

660;SUCH LOVE F;;"That God should love a sinner
such as I,
Should yearn to change my sorrow

Nor rest till He had planned to
bring me nigh,
How wonderful is love like this!

CHORUS
Such love, such wondrous love,
Such love, such wondrous love,
That God should love a sinner
such as I,
How wonderful is love like this!

That Christ should join so freely in
the scheme,
Although it meant His death on
Calvary,
Did ever human tongue find nobler
theme,
Than love divine that ransomed
me?

That for a willful outcast such as I,
The Father planned, the Saviour
bled and died;
Redemption for a worthless slave
to buy,
Who long had law and grace
defied.

And now He takes me to His
heart, a son,
He asks me not to fill a servant’s
place;
The ""far-off country"" wand’rings
all are done,
Wide open are His arms of
grace."
661;I LOVE HIM TOO MUCH E;;"I love Him too much to fail Him now,
I love Him too much to break my
vow,
For I promised the Lord,
That I would make it somehow,
And now I love Him too much,
To fail Him now."

Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine
Heir of salvation, purchased of God
Born of His Spirit, washed in His
Blood.

This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my
sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above
Filled with His goodness, lost in
His love."
663;HE TOUCHED ME D;;"Shackled by a heavy burden
’Neath a load of guilt and shame,
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same.

CHORUS
He touched me, Oh He touched me
And oh, the joy that floods my soul!
Something happened and now I
know,
He touched me and made me whole.

Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed and made me
whole,
I shall never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls."
664;MY FAITH LOOKS UP TO THEE C;;"My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Saviour divine,
Now hear me while I pray,
Take all my sin away,
O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee,
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life’s dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside."

Restore unto me the joy of Thy
salvation,
And renew a right spirit within
me"
666;WHY WORRY G;;"Why worry, when you can pray?
Trust in Jesus, He’ll knows the
way;
Don’t be a doubting Thomas,
Rest fully on His promise,
Why worry, worry, worry, worry
When you can pray?"
667;THE LOVE OF GOD C;;"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with
care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

CHORUS
O, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong;
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints and angels song.

When hoary times shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms
fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hill and mountains call;
God’s love, so sure, shall still
endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race,
The saints’ and angels’ song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment
made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the
whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."
668;WE ARE THE SONS OF GOD D;;"We are the sons of God,
We are the sons of God,
We have washed our robes

I hear the people say;
The stars of heaven are growing dim:
It must be the breaking of the day.

CHORUS
O, it must be the breaking }
of the day, }2x
The night is almost gone,
The day is coming on:
O, it must be the breaking of the day.

The signs foretold in the sun and
moon,
In earth and sea and sky,
Aloud proclaim to mortal men,
That the coming of the Master
draweth nigh.

It must be time for the waiting church
To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps
To look for the breaking of the day.

There must be those in the field of
sin,
Far from the fold astray,
Who once were happy in Jesus’ love,
And looking for the breaking of the
day.

Go quickly out in the streets and
lanes,
And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt and
blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the
day."

morning,
When with our Saviour heaven is

gather,
No storms will threaten, no fears
annoy.
O day of gladness, O day unending;

Beyond the sunset, eternal joy.
Beyond the sunset, a hand will
guide me
To God, the Father, whom I adore;
His glorious presence, His words
of welcome,
Will be my portion on that fair shore.

Beyond the sunset, O glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones who’ve
gone before.
In that fair homeland we’ll know no
parting.
Beyond the sunset forevermore."
672;MAJESTY F;;"Majesty, worship His Majesty;

of Jesus;
Magnify, come glorify Christ Jesus
the King,
Majesty, worship His Majesty,
Jesus who died, now glorified,
King of all Kings."
673;THERE IS A FOUNTAIN A;;"There is a fountain filled with blood,
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins,
And sinners, plunged beneath that
flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners, plunged beneath that
flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Wash all my sins away.
Wash all my sins away.
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious
blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

Be saved, to sin no more.
Be saved, to sin no more.
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my
theme,
And shall be till I die,

And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my
theme,
And shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping,
stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave.

Lies silent in the grave.
Lies silent in the grave.
When this poor lisping,
stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave."
674;DOWN FROM HIS GLORY D;;"Down from His glory, ever living
story,
My God and Saviour came, and
Jesus was His Name.
Born in a manger, to His own a
stranger,
A Man of sorrows, tears and
agony.

CHORUS
O how I love Him! How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!
The great Creator became my
Saviour,
And all God’s fullness dwelleth in
Him.

What condescension, bringing us
redemption;
That in the dead of night, not one
faint hope in sight;
God, gracious, tender, laid aside
His splendour,
Stooping to woo, to win to save my
soul.

Without reluctance, flesh and
blood His substance,
He took the form of man, revealed
the hidden plan.
O glorious mystery, Sacrifice of
Calvary,
And now I know Thou wert the
great ""I AM."""
675;THINK ABOUT HIS LOVE F;;"Think about His Love,

Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord,
Speak, and I’ll be quick to answer
Thee;
Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord,
Speak, and I will answer,
""Lord send me.""

When the coal of fire touched the
prophet,
Making him as pure as pure can be,
When the voice of God,
Said ""Who’ll go for us?""
Then He answered, ""Here I am,
send me.""

Millions now in sin and shame are
dying;
Listen to their sad and bitter cry;
Hasten, brother, hasten to the
rescue;
Quickly answer, ""Master, here am I.""
Soon the time for reaping will be
over;

May we hear His blessed, ""Child,

Though all hell assail me, I shall
not be moved;
Jesus will not fail me, I shall not

Just like a tree that’s planted by

I shall not be moved.

Though the tempest rages, I

To gather the Jewels home.

CHORUS
Then cheer, my brother, cheer,
Our trials will soon be o’er,
Our loved ones we shall meet,
shall meet,
Upon the golden shore.
We’re pilgrims and we’re strangers
here,
We’re seeking a city to come,
The lifeboat soon is coming,
To gather the Jewels home.

Sometimes the Devil tempts me,
And says it’s all in vain
To try to live a Christian life
And walk in Jesus’ name;
But then we hear the Master say,
""I’ll lend you a helping hand,
And if you’ll only trust Me,
I’ll guide you to that land.""

The lifeboat soon is coming,
By eyes of faith I see
As she sweeps through the waters
To rescue you and me,
And land us safely in the port
With friends we love so dear.
""Get ready,"" cries the Captain;
""Oh, look, she’s almost here.""

Oh, now’s the time to get on board,
While she is passing by;
But if you stand and wait too long,
You shall forever die;

And get on board the lifeboat,
She’ll carry you safely home."

Grace that will pardon and cleanse
within;
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that is greater than all our
sin.

Sin and despair like the sea waves
cold,
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, yes, grace
untold,
Points to the Refuge, the Mighty
Cross.

Dark is the stain that we cannot
hide,
What can avail to wash it away?
Look! there is flowing a crimson
tide;
Whiter than snow you may be

You that are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace

686;THEN JESUS CAME C;;"One sat alone beside the highway
begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he

He clutched his rags and shivered
in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and bade his
darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the tempter’s
power is broken;
When Jesus comes the tears are
wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the life
with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus
comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil
spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in
misery;
He cut himself as demon pow’rs
possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the
captive free.

""Unclean! unclean!"" the leper cried
in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in
helplessness stood near;
The fever raged, disease had
gripped its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast out
every fear.

So men today have found the
Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion,
lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them
sad and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt
Himself within."
687;WHEN WE SEE CHRIST C;;"Oft times the day seems long, our
trials hard to bear;
We’re tempted to complain, to
murmur and despair;

catch His bride away,
All tears forever over, in God’s
eternal day.

CHORUS
It will be worth it all, when we see
Jesus;
Life’s trials will seem so small,
when we see Christ;
One glimpse of His dear face, all
sorrow will erase,
So bravely run the race till we see
Christ.

Sometimes the sky looks dark,
with not a ray of light;
We’re tossed and driven on, no
human help in sight;
But there is One in heaven, who
knows our deepest care,
Let Jesus solve your problem, just
go to Him in prayer.

Life’s day will soon be over, all
storms forever past;
We’ll cross the great divide, to
glory safe at last;
We’ll share the joys of heaven, a

The tempter will be banished, we’ll

Against all evil,
Never run or even lag behind,
If you would win;
For God and the righteous,
Keep on the firing line."

ground.""

CHORUS
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on heaven’s tableland,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears
dismay;
Tho’ some may dwell where these
abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I’ll pray till heav’n I’ve found,
""Lord, lead me on to higher ground."""

When I shall lay my armour by,
And dwell in peace at home?

CHORUS
We’ll work till Jesus comes,
We’ll work till Jesus comes,
We’ll work till Jesus comes,
And we’ll be gathered home!

To Jesus Christ I fled for rest;
He bade me cease to roam;
And lean for succour on His breast
Till He conduct me home.

I sought at once my Saviour’s side,
No more my steps shall roam;
With Him I’ll brave death’s chilling
tide
And reach my heavenly home."
699;AT CALVARY G;;"Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was
crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He
died On Calvary.

CHORUS
Mercy there was great, and
grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to
me;
There my burdened soul found
liberty, at Calvary.

By God’s Word at last my sin I
learned;
Then I trembled at the law I’d
spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring
turned To Calvary.

Now I’ve given to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary.

Oh, the love that drew salvation‘s
plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down
to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did
span at Calvary."
700;GOT ANY RIVERS G;;"Got any rivers you think are

make it right.
Daystar shine down on me,
Let Your Light shine thru me in the
night.

Lord I see a world that’s dying,
Wounded by the master of deceit.
Groping in the darkness,
Haunted by the years of past
defeat;
But then I see You standing near
me,
Shining with compassion in Your
eyes.
Jesus shine down on me,
Let Your light shine thru me in the
night."

Word;
Stay with the Message that you
have heard;
List’ to His prophet, his Message
heed;
Walk in the Light where His star
doth lead.

In every church age a star did
shine,
To help God’s people a Truth to
find;
In this last church age a star
shines bright,
So friend receive it, walk in the
Light.

Do not be fearful or filled with
dread,
Your prophet sleepeth, he is not
dead;
The Bride is waiting now for that
Voice,
And in this hope we can now
rejoice.

His Word of promise He gave the
Bride,
From his White Charger the
prophet cried,
""Yet one more time shall I ride this
Trail.""

never fail."

709;ALL THE GLORY G;;"While walking on this earth,
We are nothing in ourselves,
Yet God’s chosen to use us
In His mighty hand;
For the Master's plan requires
human instruments;
But they must not ever glorify
themselves.

CHORUS
All the glory must be to the Lord,
Only He is worthy of our praise.
No one on earth should give glory
to himself;
For all the glory must be to the
Lord.

Are we ready to obey Him
When He urges us to go?
Are we willing to be nothing

Or when shining from the top,
Are we willing to lay down our lives
for Him?"

With my troubles and selfish pleas.
I know I have failed You in so
many ways,
But never have You failed
To meet all my needs;
I am the least in Your kingdom,
I know,
But Lord don’t forsake me now;
All of Your mercies
I could never afford,
I’m undeserving of Your Love,
But love me, Lord.

CHORUS
For nobody here really knows me,
And no one here understands my
fears,
And when I’m in trouble and I’m all
alone,
Lord, only You can dry my tears.
O, if You should leave me,
Then where could I go
To find rest for my weary soul?
And because I’m so unworthy,
I love You even though
I’m undeserving of Your Love
But love me Lord.

I don’t deserve the blood that You
shed,
When You died on the cross in my
stead,
And to think that each drop of
blood that fell from Your brow,
Would reach down a drop a time
To cleanse my soul now;
I don’t deserve the place that You
prepared
For my life when this world is o’er,
But take my love forever,
Your presence I adore,
I’m undeserving of Your Love,
But love me Lord."
713;HE BROUGHT ME OUT C;;"My heart was distressed ’neath
Jehovah’s dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins
dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord from the deep
miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out to
golden day.

CHORUS
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah!

He placed me upon the strong
Rock by His side,
My steps were established and
here I’ll abide;
No danger of falling while here I
remain,
But stand by His grace until the
crown I gain.

He gave me a song, ‘twas a new
song of praise,
By day and by night its sweet
notes I will raise;
My heart’s overflowing, I’m happy
and free,
I’ll praise my Redeemer, who has
rescued me.

I’ll sing of His wonderful mercy to
me,
I’ll praise Him till all men His
goodness shall see;
I’ll sing of salvation at home and
abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth and
trust in God."

Don’t you give in,
Don’t let it bring you down,
You don’t have to worry

Jesus said there’ll be tribulations,
But He said, ""I have overcome.""
Brothers and sisters, well now’s
the time to stand,
Don’t you know the battles all are

Lean on Him and we’ll all say....."

dealing
With our strife and many
problems
In our own way;
So we’re in a broken up state,
Got to find a way to prostrate,
Help us oh Lord.

BRIDGE

Don’t we?
And we need each other,

us,
And would want to really see us,
In one accord."

Something keeps holding me,
Everyday I see,
He’s helping me faithfully
To overcome my trials;
He’s guiding me constantly,
Giving me victory,

Of his desire to steal away my faith,
But I have found in time the
revelation,
The strength I need to keep me by
His grace."

hillside,
That overlooks life’s sea;
When I’m tossed it sends out a
light,
That I might see;

darkness now,
Will safely lead me o’er;
If it was not for that lighthouse
My ship would sail no more.

CHORUS
I thank God for the Lighthouse,
I owe my life to Him;
For Jesus is the Lighthouse,
And from the rocks of sin
He has shone His Light around
me,
That I might clearly see;
If it was not for that Lighthouse
Tell me where would this ship be

Everybody that lives around us,
Says tear that old lighthouse
down,
The big ships don’t sail this way
anymore,
There’s no use of it standing round
But then my mind goes back to
that stormy night,
When just in time, I saw the Light,
Yes, the Light from that old
Lighthouse
That stands up there on the hill."

Taking back the land,
Marching our vessels into war;
We are binding up the wounded,

Advancing from the ocean
Back to the shore.

strategy,
Confusing the enemy,
We’re doing it all through unity,

Trusting, serving, every day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Soon His beauty we’ll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold."
738;I WAS ON HIS MIND C;;"There’s no one great amongst us,
We’re nothing on our own,
We make mistakes, and often slip,
Just common flesh and bone;
But someday, I’ll prove just why I
say,

For while He was on the Cross
I was on His mind.

CHORUS
For, He knew me,
Yet, He loved me,`
He whose glory makes the
heavens shine.
I am so unworthy of such mercy,
Yet, while He was on the Cross
I was on His mind.

The look of love was on His face,
The thorns were on His head,
Blood was on His scarlet robe,
Stained in crimson red;
Though His eye was on the crowd
that day
He looked ahead in time,
And while He was on the cross
I was on His mind."
739;MY TENT NO MORE PITCHED F;;"My tent is no more pitched

river,
I’ll rest ’neath the evergreen tree;
I’ll carry my cross till the midnight
Come morning there’s glory for
me.

go on."

Farther along we’ll know all about
it,
Farther along we’ll understand
why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in the
sunshine,
We’ll understand it all by and by.

When death has come and taken
our loved ones,
It leaves our home so lonely and
drear;
Then do we wonder why others
prosper,
Living so wicked year after year.

Faithful till death said our loving
Master,
A few more days to labour and
wait
Toils of the road will then seem as
nothing,
As we sweep through the beautiful
gate.

When we see Jesus coming in
glory,
When He comes from His home in
the sky;
Then we shall meet Him in that
bright mansion,
We’ll understand it all by and by."

It’s later than you think;
The Bride is preparing now,
For her Lord to meet.
All things are ready now,
The combine is here.
He that hath an ear to hear,
The evening time is here.

Gross darkness throughout the
land,
And people can’t understand,
God’s prophet has warned the land
Proclaiming the Word to men;
So if you’ll be saved today,
Just follow that way He gave,
That’s accepting the Word of God
Oh, this is the evening time.

Seven thunders they don’t believe,
How else could the Seals be
revealed
To give the Bride rapturing faith,
Sleeping saints and our Lord to
meet.
If you want to be raptured today,
Follow Ephesians 0:11’s way,
It’s the anointed Word today,
Oh, this is the evening time."

Another sunset that I’ll see,
God will make this trial a blessing,
Just be patient, you will see.

CHORUS
God will make this trial a blessing,
Though it sends me to my knees;
Though my tears flow like a river
Yet in Him there’s sweet relief;
There’s no need to get discouraged,
There’s no need to talk defeat;
God will make this trial a blessing,
And the whole wide world will see.

I was not the first one to come into
this place,
You see every child of God this
test he must face,
It is here that God will mould you,
And make you what you ought to be.
God will make this trial a blessing,
Just be patient you will see.

I’m standing on the mountain,
Looking back I can see
When I was in my lowest valley,
His strong hand was leading me.
Oh, it’s good to see the sunrise,
And to taste sweet victory!
God has made this trial a blessing,
Oh, the love He has for me."
749;YOU ARE WORTHY G;;"You are worthy to be praised,
Lord Almighty,
And I worship You,
You are worthy to be praised;
Lord, I love You, and I worship
You,
You are worthy to be praised,
You are worthy, worthy,
Worthy to be praised."
750;JESUS NEVER FAILS F;;"So many have tested Him
Throughout the course of time,
So many still reach out to Him
With broken hearts and minds,
And every one of them will say,
Without exception that they find:
Jesus never fails.

CHORUS
Jesus never fails, Jesus never
fails,
You might as well get thee
behind me, Satan,
You cannot prevail
Because Jesus never fails.

Even in the days of old
He brought His people through,
Then He came and He showed
His love,
And died for me and you.
Jesus rose again and He proved
That His story has been true,
That Jesus never fails.

Sometimes in my life comes
trouble,
At times so hard to bear;
I know I could not make it
Without my Saviour being there;
It’s so encouraging just to know,
However deep we’re in despair:
That Jesus never fails."
751;BIND US TOGETHER D;;"Bind us together Lord, bind us
together
With cords that cannot be
broken,
Bind us together Lord, bind us

There is only one King,
There is only one body,
That is why I sing."

753;THROUGH IT ALL F;;"I've had many tears and sorrows,
I've had questions for tomorrow,
Many times I didn’t know right
from wrong;
But in every situation,
God gave me blessed
consolation,
That my trials only come to make
me strong.

CHORUS
Through it all, through it all,
I’ve learned to trust in Jesus,
I’ve learned to trust in God;
Through it all, through it all,
I’ve learned to depend upon His
Word.

I’ve been to lots of places,
And I’ve seen millions of faces,
But there were times I felt so all
alone;
But in my lonely hours,
Those precious lonely hours,
Jesus let me know that I am His
own.

So I thank God for the
mountains,
And I thank Him for the valleys,
And I thank Him for the storms
He brought me through;
For if I never had a problem,
How could I know that my God
would solve them;
How could I know what faith in
God can do."
754;IT’S THE LIFE A;;"It’s the life behind the Name,
That makes the demons tremble;
It’s the life behind the Name,
That makes the proud heart
humble;
It was God who devised a plan,
That in all things like a man,
He would live, so He could give,
Give us the life behind the Name."
755;DO YOU KNOW GRACE D;;"I was down as low as one could go,
I had no strength of my own;
Everything I worked for all my life,
Everything I loved was gone;
The lowest valley of my life.
I was flat on my face,
But then the great hand of Jesus
Reached down and picked me up,
Oh yes! I know grace.

CHORUS
Do you know grace,
Amazing grace?
Have you heard how sweet the
sound?
There are many dangers, toils and
snares,
We’ve already come,
Look where you came from
And where you are,
And I’ll ask you, ""Do you know
grace?""

When it comes time for Him to
take His Bride,
To that evergreen shore,
And He chooses you and I
To live in that land forever more;
When we’ve been there ten
thousand years,
And you see me in that place,
Oh! you could ask me this
question again,
I’ll say, ""Yes! I remember grace."""
756;ONLY BY GRACE A;;"Only by grace can we enter,
Only by grace can we stand,
Not by our human endeavor;
But by the blood of the Lamb.
Into Your presence You called us,
You called us to come;
Into Your presence You draw us,
And now by Your grace we
come,}2x

Lord, if You mark our }
transgression, who would stand?}
Thanks to Your grace we are }
cleansed }
By the blood of the Lamb. }2x"
757;ARE YOU WASHED? F;;"Do you know what it is
Not to have one guilty feeling,
Not to wonder where you’re going
when you die;
Not condemned of the past,
Not afraid of what tomorrow holds
in store
And know the reason why?
Yes, that’s just how it is
When you go down in the water
’Cause by faith you believe in what
you heard,
It’s no impossible dream,
You can start over clean
When you’re washed by the water
of the Word.

CHORUS
Are you washed by }
the water, }
Washed by the water }
of the Word? }2x

It's like being born again
With a whole new life to live,
Never having to look back to what
you’ve been,
’Cause according to the Lord
You’ve just started your existence,
And where He’s concerned there
never was no sin;
For when God looks your way
He no longer sees a sinner
But a saint who’s been washed
white as snow;
Not by any thing we’ve done
But by the blood of God’s own Son.
Are you washed by the water of
the Word?"
758;IF THAT SAME SPIRIT C;;"If that same Spirit that raised }
Christ from the dead }
Dwell in you, dwell in you, }2x

body, }
If that Spirit dwell in you. }2x"
759;I WAS BORN TO SERVE F;;"From the dust of the earth,
My God formed this body,
His breath made me a living
soul;
And then the light of His Word
Struck the germ deep inside me,
That is why, that is why I love
Him
so.

CHORUS
For I was made in His likeness,
Created in His image,
For I was born to serve the Lord;
And I can’t deny Him,
I will always walk beside Him,
For I was born to serve the Lord.

My hands, they were made to
serve His people,
My eyes, they were made to
read God’s Word;
My feet, they were made to walk
in His pathway;
And my body is the temple of the
Lord.

Whom He foreknew, He did
predestinate,
To be conformed into His image,
Whom He foreknew, it’s them He
also called.
Whom He called, He did justify;
Whom He justified, He has
glorified,
And I’m waiting for the
translation
to meet my Lord."
760;ALL OVER THE WORLD A;;"All over the world the Spirit is
moving,
All over the world as the prophet
said it would be;
All over the world there’s a mighty
revelation
Of the coming of the Lord as the
waters cover the sea.

Deep down in my heart.........."
761;MY TRIBUTE G;;"How can I say thanks
For the things You have done for me,
Things so undeserved,
Yet You gave to prove Your love
for me;
The voices of a million angels
Could not express my gratitude;
All that I am and ever hope to be
I owe it all to Thee.

CHORUS
To God be the glory, }3x
For the things He has done;
With His blood He has saved me,
With His power He has raised me;
To God be the glory,
For the things He has done.

Just let me live my life,
Let it be pleasing Lord unto Thee;
And should I gain any praise,
Let it go to Calvary."
762;QUIET ME D;;"Working daily for Your cause,
There's so little time to pause
And seek Ye prayerfully.
Good intentions somehow fail,
Empty promises prevail;
Oh Lord, am I too busy for You to
quiet me?

CHORUS
Quiet me,
Let peaceful waters flow,
Learn to be still my soul.
Let me hear
Jesus walking near,
Touch me Lord, and quiet me.

There’re so many songs unsung,
And dreams not yet begun,
For there’s so much to do
In so little time;
Yet there is nothing that can
replace
All the times I seek Your face;
Oh Lord, I want Your perfect will
For this life of mine."
763;MY SINS ARE GONE C;;"You ask me why I’m happy,
So I’ll just tell you why;
Because my sins are gone,
And when I meet the scoffers,
Who ask me where they are,
I say, ""my sins are gone.""

CHORUS
They’re underneath the Blood,
On the Cross of Calvary;
As far removed as darkness is
from dawn,
In the sea of God’s forgetfulness,
That’s good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar,
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone,
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I’m glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me,
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, ""my sins are gone,
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,""
I’m glad my sins are gone.

I'm living now for Jesus,
I’m happy night and day
Because my sins are gone,
My soul is filled with music,
With all my heart I say,
""I know my sins are gone."""
764;LET HIM BREATHE ON ME D;;"Let Him breathe on me,
Let Him breathe on me,
Let the breath of God
Now breathe on me;
Let Him breathe on me,
Let Him breathe on me,
Let the breath of God
Now breathe on me."
765;HE SET ME FREE G;;"Once like a bird in prison I dwelt,
No freedom from my sorrow I felt,
Then Jesus came and listened to
me;
And glory to God, He set me free.

CHORUS
He set me free, yes, He set me free;
He broke the bonds of prison for
me;
I’m glory bound my Jesus to see,
For glory to God He set me free.

Now I am climbing higher each
day,
Darkness of night has drifted
away,
My feet are planted on higher
ground,
And glory to God I’m homeward
bound.

Good-bye to sin and things that
confound,
Naught of this world shall turn
me around,
Daily I’m working, I’m praying
too,
And glory to God, I’m going
through."
766;WHAT A MIGHTY GOD F;;"What a mighty God we serve,
What a mighty God we serve,
Angels bow before Him,
Heaven and earth adore Him,
What a mighty God we serve."
767;HE WAS THERE A;;"He was there all the time,
He was there all the time,
Waiting patiently in love,
He was there all the time."
768;NO ONE EVER CARED A;;"I would love to tell you what I think
of Jesus,
Since I’ve found in Him a friend so
kind and true.
I would tell you how He changed
my life completely,
He did something that no other
friend can do.

CHORUS
No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
There’s no other friend so kind as
He,
No one else could take the sin and
darkness from me,
Oh how much He cares for me.

Every day He comes to me with
new assurance,
More and more I understand His
words of Life.
I would never know just why He
came to save me,
Till someday soon I’ll see His
blessed face above."
769;BELOVED LET US LOVE F;;"Beloved let us love one another;
For love is of God,
And everyone that loveth is borned
of God and knoweth God.
He that loveth not knoweth not
God, for God is love;
Beloved let us love one another
with Jesus' love.

Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
And its righteousness,
And all these things shall be added
unto you. Hal -le-lu, Hallelujah!

Man shall not live by bread alone,
But by every Word
That proceeds from the mouth of
God. Hallelujah!"
770;MORE OF YOU A;;"I’m not trying to find just some new
frame of mind,
That will change my old point of
view.
For I’ve been through it all;
Deep inside nothing’s changed,
I’m not new;
I’m not seeking a gift or emotional
lift.
But one thing I’m longing to do,
Is to lift up my cup and let You fill it
up with just You!

CHORUS
More of You, more of You,
I’ve had all, {I cry Lord} but what I
need, just more of You.
Of things I’ve had my fill
And yet I hunger still;
Empty and bare, Lord, hear my
prayer for more of You.

I have searched all around
In the husks that abound,
But I find no nourishment there;
Now my strength’s almost gone
and I feel the pull of despair;
Yet my thirst drives me on,
and I stumble along,
Over ground so barren and dry,
For the spring’s just ahead,
Living water! Lord, fill me, I cry."

Hold on, }
There is no failure in God. }2x

Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of God
my Saviour;
Standing, standing,
I’m standing on the promises of
God.

Standing on the promises that
cannot fail,
When the howling storms of
doubt and fear assail.
By the living Word of God I shall
prevail,
Standing on the promises of
God.

Standing on the promises I now
can see
Perfect, present cleansing in the
blood for me;
Standing in the liberty where
Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of
God.

Standing on the promises of Christ
the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally by love’s
strong cord,
Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s
sword,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises I cannot
fall,
Listening every moment to the
Spirit’s call,
Resting in my Saviour as my all in
all,
Standing on the promises of God."

the clouds of heaven,
Coming back to earth to catch
away His own;
Then may we all be ready, when
midnight cry is given,
To go and reign with Christ on His
throne.

CHORUS
Gladly may we herald the message of
His blessed appearing,
Soon He’s coming in glory, tell to
one and all;
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord,
why slumber when the end is
nearing,
But get ready for the final call.

We’re longing for the glory that
awaits the faithful,
Who shall overcome, and every
conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward,
The prize is life eternal
To all who win the fight over sin.

We’re praying for the advent of our
blessed Saviour,
Who has promised life to all who
trust His grace;
His coming now is pending, the
message being given,
And soon we’ll see our Lord face
to face.

We see the signs appearing of His
blessed coming,
Lo, behold the fig leaves now
becoming green;
The gospel of His kingdom has
gone to every nation;
That we are near the end can be
seen."
774;EMPTY ME F;;"Oh Lord, I’ve heard Your Word
that has called me,
And now I can’t turn away;
I’m compelled by the truth that I
hear,
Just to walk with You my Lord,
This is my prayer.

CHORUS
Empty me, dear Lord,
Of all my self and pride;
Empty me, dear Lord,
Remove secret sins inside;
Empty me, Oh, my loving Lord,
Until I’m just like a little child,
So Your will could be done in my
life.

And I know that in myself I am not
worthy Lord,
Of the place that You’ve prepared
for me;
But I love You, and I really want to
serve You,
So each day of my life
I will live for You.

Sometimes from within,
Lord, how I groan and cry,
How I hunger and I thirst for Thee;
But I would not be satisfied,
Until I be filled with You,
Empty me, so that I can be filled
with You."

From an old rugged tree,
And it whispers draw closer to
Me,
Leave this world far behind,
There are new heights to climb,
And a new place in Me you will
find.

CHORUS
And whatever it takes,
To draw closer to You Lord,
That’s what I’ll be willing to do,
And whatever it takes,
For my will to break,
That’s what I’ll be willing to do.

I'll trade sunshine for rain,
Comfort for pain,
That’s what I’ll be willing to do;
And whatever it takes,
For my will to break,
That’s what I’ll be willing to do.

Take the dearest thing to me,
If that’s how it must be,
To draw me closer to Thee;
Let the disappointments come,
Lonely days without the sun,
If in sorrow, more like You I’ll
become.

Take my houses, take my lands,
Take my dreams and my plans,
For I’m placing my whole life in
Your hands,
And if You’ll call me today to a
land far away,
Then I’ll go and Your will obey."

Till I stand in heaven’s fair land,
Till I’m safe forever more,
On that happy golden shore,
No, He’ll never let go of my hand.

He's been faithful when cold winds

But His holy love that amazes me
Is that He loves me, even when I
fail."

Victory ahead! Victory ahead,
Through the blood of Jesus,
Victory ahead;
Trusting in the Lord, I hear the
conqueror’s tread,
By faith I see the victory ahead.

David, with a shepherd’s sling
and five stones,
Met the giant on the field all
alone;
Trusting in the Lord, he knew
what God had said,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Daniel prayed unto the Lord thrice
each day,
Then unto the lion’s den led the way;
Trusting in the Lord, he did not fear
or dread,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Often with the carnal mind I was
tried,
Asking for deliverance oft I cried;
Trusting in the Lord, I reckoned I
was dead,
By faith I saw the victory ahead.

When like those who’ve gone
before to that land,
By death’s river cold and dark I
shall stand;
Trusting in the Lord, I will not fear
or dread,
By faith I see the victory ahead."

With swift feet they shall run,
They shall leap the mountain like a

Like a great angelic choir sing,
I can almost hear their voices ring.

Now the time has come to count

For the One who died to give us life;
Till the Trumpet sounds on that
final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say.

Is coming in plain view;
O, to cap God’s chosen Bride,
Redemption draweth nigh;
He’s that lovely One,
He’s coming in plain view.

The grapes are yours and mine,
Little foxes spoil the vine,
For the vineyard blossoms forth
her harvest time;
Keep your eyes on things above,
Don’t look at me or you,
See that lovely One, He’s coming
in plain view.

In the cleft of the Rock,
In the secret place so high,
Till the daybreak and the
shadows
flee away,
Oh, in that mountain place,
A sweet smell’s coming through;
He’s that lovely One -
He’s coming in plain view."
790;WHEREVER I AM F;;"Wherever I am, I’ll praise Him,
Whenever I can, I’ll praise Him,
For His love surrounds me like the
sea,
I’ll praise the Name of Jesus,
Lift up the Name of Jesus,
For the Name of Jesus lifted me."
791;VICTORY IN JESUS F;;"I heard an old, old story,
How a Saviour came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning,
Of His precious blood’s atoning,
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory.

CHORUS
O victory in Jesus,
My Saviour, forever,
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing,
How He made the lame to walk
again
And caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, ""Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit,""
And somehow Jesus came and
brought
To me the victory.

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of
gold
Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I’ll sing up
there
The song of victory."
792;I AM BLESSED F;;"I am blessed, I am blessed,
Every day that I live I am
blessed;
When I wake up in the morning,
When I lay my head to rest
I am blessed, I am blessed."
793;HAD IT NOT BEEN F;;"Just suppose God searched
through heaven,
And couldn’t find one worthy to be
The supreme sacrifice that was
needed,
To buy eternal life for you and me.

CHORUS
Had it not been for a place called
Mt. Calvary,
Had it not been for the old rugged
Cross,
Had it not been for a Man called
Jesus,
Then forever, my soul would be
lost.

I’m so glad He was willing to drink
that bitter cup,
Although He prayed, ""Father let it
pass from me,""
I’m so glad He didn’t call Heaven’s
angels,
To take the nails from His hands
that set me free.

I’m so glad He has promised a
Second Cycle,
And I’m so glad He’s now riding
this trail again,
I’m so glad He revealed those
Seven Thunders
To give His Bride the power in His
New Name."
794;I LOVE YOU LORD F;;"I love You Lord, and I lift my
voice,
To worship You, O my soul, rejoice,
Take joy my King in what You hear,
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
In Your ear."
795;A BRAND NEW TOUCH D;;"CHORUS
Lord, You know I need a brand
new touch,
My strength from yesterday is
gone;
But if You’ll give me, Lord,
another touch,
I’ll have the strength to carry on.

I tho't the sun had come to stay,
But all too soon it went away,
And in its place the storm clouds
came,
And with the clouds there came
the rain;
It rained so hard and oh, so long,
But midst the storm I felt a calm;
It was Your touch that brought
me through it all,
Without Your help I’d surely fall.

Yesterday has come and gone,
And now a new day’s coming on,
I do not know what it may bring,
My heart may cry instead of sing;
But it matters not what comes my
way, Lord,
If You’ll just touch me new each
day;
Your loving touch drives all my
fears away,
Close by Your side I want to stay.

BRIDGE
Lord, You know how weak I
really am,
Even better than myself;
But with Your help I know I really
can,
Make it thro’ the darkest night,
And everything's gonna be all
right."

Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgement day?
Are you ready? Are you ready
for the judgement day?

There’s a bright day coming, a
bright day coming,
There’s a bright day coming by
and by,
But its brightness shall only come
to them that love the Lord,
Are you ready for that day to come?

There’s a sad day coming, a sad
day coming,
There’s a sad day coming by and
by,

doom,
""Depart, I know ye not,""
Are you ready for that day to
come?"
798;GOD IS GOD D;;"God is God, and He always

He’s the God in the lion’s den;
He’s the God of the whole creation,
He’s the God in the hearts of men."
799;WEAR A CROWN F;;"Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His Name?

CHORUS
And when the battle’s over, we
shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown! Yes,
we shall wear a crown!
And when the battle’s over, we
shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.
Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown;
And when the battle’s over, we
shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God?

Sure I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord;
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word."
800;I AM ONE OF THE FEW G;;"I am one of the few, one of the
few,
And by faith in God’s Word I can
claim it;
Though the way may seem long,
Though the opposition strong,
For the Bride there’s a way
provided;
If you plan to go through,
Just to hope would not do,
But you’ve got to be firmly decided
To follow the Lord by obeying His
Word,
And believe that ""I’m one of the
few."""
801;GO TELL THEM I AM F;;"I would that all be saved
And live an abundant life,
And know what it’s like to be so
free,
Free from sin and strife.

CHORUS
Oh, but how, how will they know Me
But by My word?
Oh and how, how will you tell them,
Unless you go and do the things
you’ve heard?

I would that all be fed
And all be clothed,
And everyone would be so
blessed,
And all would be made whole.

I would that all men would prosper
And walk in My divine health,
But don’t you know their soul’s
Got to grow first of all,
Or never will they touch my wealth.

Some of you are called to be
missionaries,
Others are called to remain;
Beautiful are all the feet of those
who carry
To the world, My Word and My
Name.

BRIDGE
You’ve got to lay hands on the sick
And they’ll recover,
It’s written in my Word
And you know it’s true;
You’ve got to raise up the dead in
Jesus Name,

you.
Go tell them I AM, Go tell them I
AM..."

picture,
The hoarding mobs for selfish

sealed, it’s all in vain.

CHORUS
The end is here, it’s now at hand,
The Bride is gathering; the world is
failing;
Israel’s awakening; nations are
breaking;
Our prophet taught us, we believe
the end is here.

Sirs, this is the time! our prophet
spoke of,
The Angel came with a Shout,
The mountain shook as His Voice
cried out,
""Time is no more."" loud and clear
the Shout went forth.

captives,
And the opening of the prisons to
them that are bound.

CHORUS
It’s the anointing that makes the
difference,
Once you’ve known It
You’ll never be the same;
You can’t live without It
Once it rests upon you;
It will teach you how to walk in
Jesus’ name.
In My name, you will cast out
demons;

In M y name, you will speak with

You shall lay your hand upon the
sick,
And they will recover;
All these signs shall follow you in

Seeking a refuge for my soul?
Needing a friend to help me in the

My most precious treasure
Lavished on Thee;
Broken and spilled out,

So, Lord, let me sing Your bride a
song."
842;I SHALL KNOW HIM D;;"Standing somewhere in the
shadows you’ll find Jesus,
He’s the One who always cares
and understands;
Standing somewhere in the
shadows you will find Him,
And you’ll know Him by the nailprints
in His hand.

CHORUS
I shall know Him, I shall know Him,
As redeemed by His side I shall
stand;
I shall know Him, I shall know Him
By the prints of the nails in His
hands."
843;FILL ME NOW F;;"Hover o’er me, Holy Spirit,
Bathe my trembling heart and brow;
Fill me with Thy hallowed
presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.

CHORUS
Fill me now, fill me now,
Jesus, come and fill me now;
Fill me with Thy hallowed
presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.

Thou cans’t fill me, gracious Spirit,
Though I cannot tell Thee how;
But I need Thee, greatly need
Thee,
Come, O come and fill me now.

I am weakness, full of weakness,
At Thy sacred feet I bow;
Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
Fill with pow’r, and fill me now.

Cleanse and comfort, bless and
save me,
Bathe, O bathe my heart and brow;
Thou art comforting and saving,
Thou art sweetly filling now."
844;TOUCH YOUR PEOPLE F;;"We need wisdom, we need power,
And true love for each other,
We have had so many big but
empty worlds,
So we come before Your face,
Asking for Your grace,
Bring Your people to a state of
fruitful life;
Restore Your church again.

CHORUS
Touch Your people once again,
With Your precious Holy hand, we
pray,
Let Your Kingdom shine upon this
earth,
Thru a living glorious church;
Not for temporary needs, but to
restore authority and power,
Let Your mighty rushing wind blow
in,
Touch Your people once again.

Lord You see Your tired servants,
And Your broken wounded soldiers,
Oh, how much we need Your
precious healing hands;
We need the power of the cross,
It’s the only source for us,
When we stand up facing final
battle cry;
Restore Your church again."
845;WHERE THERE'S A DEEP C;;"We see the tree in the winter,
The green leaves are turned
brown and red,
The life that was there has gone
back to the ground,
It looks like the tree is dead.
There is a promise of springtime,
That life will be made anew;
It speaks of the resurrection
morning,
It shows that God's Word is true,

CHORUS
Where there’s a deep, deep
calling,
There’s a deep, deep to respond
Where there’s a hope for a city,
There’s a land beyond the sun,
Where there’s a yearning,
burning, to leave this world we
have known,
There is a King returning, coming
to take us home.

Each one must come to his winter,
And God all His children has
saved,
That though they may lay us
beneath the cold ground,
The life that was there is not
dead,
We have a promise of
springtime,
That life would be made anew,
We'll meet at the resurrection
morning,
We'll sail beyond the blue.

God's seed had to die and be
buried,
In Luther it started to sprout,
The work had begun, drawn forth
by the sun,
The message of faith brought it
out,
Then came the stalk by John
Wesley,
The Holy Ghost made the wheat
grow,
Then the chaff and the wheat
separated,
God’s seventh angel Word made
it so."
846;THE OLD ACCOUNT G;;"There was a time on earth,
When in the book of heaven
An old account was standing for
sins yet unforgiven;
My name was at the top and many
things below,
I went unto the keeper and settled
l ong ago.

CHORUS
Long ago, (down on my knees)
Long ago (I settled it all)
Yes, the old account was settled
Long ago; (Hallelujah!)
And the record’s clear today,
For He washed my sins away,
When the old account was settled
l ong ago.

The old account was large,
And growing everyday,
For I was always sinning,
And never tried to pay;
But when I looked ahead
And saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle,
I settled long ago.

When at the judgement bar,
I stand before my King,
And He the book will open,
He cannot find a thing;
Then will my heart be glad,
While tears of joy will flow
Because I had it settled and
settled long ago.

When in that happy home,
My Saviour's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story,
And praise Him for His love;
I'll not forget that book,
With pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled,
And settled long ago.

Oh sinner, seek the Lord,
Repent of all your sin,
For thus He hath commanded,
If you would enter in;
And then if you should live
A hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it,
You settled long ago."
847;SINCE I’VE BEEN REDEEMED C;;"I have a song I love to sing,
Since I have been redeemed,
Of my Redeemer, Saviour, King,
Since I have been redeemed.

CHORUS
Since I have been redeemed,
Since I have been redeemed
I will glory in His name;
Since I have been redeemed,
I will glory in my Saviour’s name

I have a Christ that satisfies,
Since I have been redeemed,
To do His will my highest prize,
Since I have been redeemed.

I have a witness bright and clear,
Since I have been redeemed,
Dispelling every doubt and fear,
Since I have been redeemed.

I have a home prepared for me,
Since I have been redeemed,
Where I shall dwell eternally,
Since I have been redeemed."
848;BATTLE HYMN OF REPUBLIC G;;"Mine eyes have seen the glory of
the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are
stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous
sentence by the dim and flaring
lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the
trumpet that shall never sound
retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of
men before His judgement seat;
O, be swift, my soul to answer
Him! be jubilant my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ
was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that
transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
Let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on."
849;I COULD NEVER OUT LOVE F;;"There’ve been times when giving,
And loving brought pain,
And I promised I would never,
Let it happen again;
But I found out, that loving,
Was well worth the risk,
And that even in losing I’ll win.

CHORUS
I want to live, the way
He wants me to live;
I want to give,
Until there’s just no more to give;
I want to love, love,
Till there’s just no more love;
I could never, ever out love my
Lord.

Jesus showed us that only
Through dying we live,
And He gave, when it seemed
There was no more to give,
Jesus loved when loving
Brought heartache and loss;
And He forgave from the old
rugged Cross."
850;NO NEVER ALONE A;;"I’ve seen the lightning flashing,
And heard the thunder roll;
I’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing,
Trying to conquer my soul;
I’ve heard the voice of my
Saviour,
Telling me still to fight on;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

CHORUS
No, never alone! No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone! No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

The world’s fierce winds are
blowing,
Temptations sharp and keen;
I feel a peace in knowing
My Saviour stands between;
He stands to shield me from
danger,
When earthly friends are gone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

When in affliction's valley,
I’m treading the road of care;
My Saviour helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet, entangled with briars,
Ready to cast me down,
My Saviour whispers His promise,
""I never will leave thee alone""

He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side;
For me He opened the fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He’s waiting in glory,
Seated upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone."
851;WE'LL TALK IT OVER C;;"Tho' shadows deepen and my
heart bleeds,
I will not question the way He leads;
This side of heaven we know in part,
I will not question a broken heart.

CHORUS
We’ll talk it over in the by and by,
We’ll talk it over, my Lord and I,
I’ll ask the reasons, He’ll tell me why,
When we talk it over in the by and
by.

I'll trust His leading; He’ll never fail,
Thro’ darkest tunnels or misty vale;
Obey His bidding and faithful be,
Tho’ only one step ahead I see.

I’ll hide my heartache behind a
smile,
And wait for reasons till after while;
And ‘tho He try me I know I’ll find,
That all my burdens are silver lined."
852;MORE THAN ENOUGH C;;"Jehovah Jireh, my Provider,
You are more than enough for me.
Jehovah Rapha, You’re my Healer,
By Your stripes I’ve been set free.
Jehovah Shammah You are with me,
You supply all my needs;
You are more than enough,
You are more than enough,
You are more than enough for me.
Jehovah Nissi, You are my
victory, You are more than
enough for me.

Jehovah sidkenu, my righteousness,
All You are I now can be.
Jehovah Ra-ah, You're my shepherd,
Shalom, You are my peace.
You are more than enough, so
much more than enough, You
are more than enough for me."
853;HAVE THINE OWN WAY C;;"Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Thou art the Potter;
I am the clay.
Mould me and make me
After Thy will,
While I am waiting,
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me,
Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in Thy presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me I pray!
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine !
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine!

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o’er my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see,
Christ only, always,
Living in me!"
854;I WAS GLAD C;;"I was glad when they said unto
me,
I was glad when they said unto
me,
I was glad when they said unto
me,
Let us go in the house of the
Lord.

So glad, { so glad }
So glad, { so glad }
So glad, { so glad }
So glad."
855;JESUS IN ME D;;"William Branham is the prophet
To this seventh age;
He revealed every mystery,
And to God we give our praise.
With the saints he is waiting
For us to understand,
The seven thunders mystery,
The stature of a perfect man.

CHORUS
Jesus in me, Jesus in me,
Seven thunders within this life of
mine,
From Paul to William Branham,
From Faith to Perfect love,
These lively stones are reaching
out to God.

There is no one like my Jesus,
No person can compare,
He satisfies me fully,
There’s no reason for despair;
And when battles in this life
Get me down all so low,
He fills my lamp with living oil
When in prayer to Him I go.

His grace is all sufficient
For this failing flesh of mine,
Every answer to the Bible,
It has been there all the time;
And even though I fail Him daily,
Perfection dwells within,
Those seven thundering voices
Will bring Jesus back again.

The foundation of the pyramid
Is Faith preached by Paul,
Irenaeus fought for Virtue,
That pyramid grew tall.
Do you see where we are
standing?
Just one more step and then
Those seven thundering voices
Will bring Jesus back again."
856;THE OLD FASHIONED MEETING C;;"Oh, how well I remember in the
old-fashioned days,
When some old-fashioned
people had some old-fashioned
ways;
In the old-fashioned meetings, as
they tarried there,
In the old-fashioned manner,
How God answered their prayer.

CHORUS
'Twas an old-fashioned meeting, in
an old-fashioned place,
Where some old-fashioned people
had some old-fashioned grace:
As an old-fashioned sinner I began
to pray,
And God heard me, and saved me
in the old-fashioned way.

There was singing, such singing of
those old-fashioned airs!
There was power, such power in
those old-fashioned prayers,
An old-fashioned conviction made
the sinner pray,
And the Lord heard and saved
him,
In the old-fashioned way.

Well, they say it is better, ""Things
have changed don’t you know,""
And the people in general, seem to
think it is so;
And they call me old-fashioned
when I dare to say,
That I like it far better in the
old-fashioned way.

If the Lord never changes, as the
fashions of men,
If He’s always the same, why,
He is old-fashioned then!
As an old-fashioned sinner saved
thro’ old time grace,
Oh, I’m sure He will take me to an
old-fashioned place."
857;IN HIS PAVILION F;;"In times of trouble and inward
struggle
When it seems the end of the way,
Taking His direction,
I’m longing for perfection,
I only need to feel His hand in mine.

CHORUS
Dear Jesus, I’m in Your pavilion,
There I’ll find the strength
I need to carry on,
In the secret of Your presence,
Beholding Your beauty, oh Lord.

In God’s Word I’m reading, how
my life is leading,
Onward to that beautiful shore.
I’ll greet the saints at heaven’s door,
With a love I’ve never felt before,
What joy is waiting there for me.

But until then, I’ll stay
In Your pavilion,
There I’ll find the strength
I need to carry on;
In the secret of Your presence,
Beholding Your beauty oh Lord."
858;THE LILY OF THE VALLEY D;;"I've found a friend in Jesus, He's
everything to me.
He's the fairest of ten thousand to
my soul;
The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone
I see
All I need to cleanse and make me
fully whole.
In sorrow He's my comfort, in
trouble He's my stay,
He tells me every care on Him to
roll. Hallelujah!
He’s The Lily of the Valley, the
Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to
my soul.

He all my grief has taken, and all
my sorrows borne;
In temptation He's my strong and
mighty tower;
I have all for Him forsaken, and all
my idols torn
From my heart, and now He keeps
me by His power.

Though all the world forsake me,
and Satan tempt me sore,
Through Jesus I shall safely reach
the goal. Hallelujah!
He's the Lily of the Valley, the
Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to
my soul.
He'll never, never leave me, nor
yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith and do His
blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, I've nothing
now to fear;
With His manna He my hungry
soul shall fill.

Then sweeping up to glory, we'll
see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever
roll. Hallelujah!
He's the Lily of the Valley, the
Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to
my soul."
859;THERE IS A RIVER F;;"There was a thirsty woman,
Who was drawing from a well,
Her life was ruined and wasted,
Her soul was bound for hell.
Then she met the Master,
Who told of her great sin,
He said, ""If you drink this water,
You’ll never thirst again.""

CHORUS
There is a river
That flows from deep within.
There is a fountain
That frees the soul from sin.
Come to these waters;
There is a vast supply.
There is a river,
That never shall run dry.

There came a sound from Heaven
As a rushing, mighty wind,
It filled their hearts with singing,
And gave them peace within.
The prophet gave the promise,
The Spirit will descend,
And from your inner being,
A river with no end."
860;THE BRIDE OF CHRIST;;"The Bride of Christ is an oddball
She stands like a great speckled bird
She's sprinkled with the blood of her Husband
She's not ashamed of her mate

She's mocked by the world and the churches
She bears the reproach of the Word
She wears no make-up of Creeds and Dogmas
She wears the garment of the Word

The Bride is standing like a lady
She's dressed in an old fashioned way
But that's the way her husband likes it
He's coming to take his Bride away

The Bridegroom has placed in her finger
A ring of unmerited grace
The marriage certificate has been written
And that's the Lamb's Book of Life

The marriage has already been conducted
The Bridegroom came in '63
The marriage counsellor William Branham
Has joined the Bride to the Bridegroom

The Bride is married to one husband
She's dead to the world and denominations
She's pregnant with His word the 7 Seals
She'll manifest the Son, the Spoken Word

The Bride is going to the marriage supper
She'll meet her Bridegroom in the air
She'll be rejoicing for 3 ½ years, 
And then she'll come to the Millennium"
861;THE GRASS IS GREENER D;;"Well I watched a hand today
Reach out to a loved one,
And it nearly broke my heart to say
good-bye
When I heard my brother say that
He was leaving,
I’ve been waiting, oh so long, for
God’s chariot to take me home
Where the grass is greener on the
other side,
Where the grass is greener on the
other side.

CHORUS
Where the roses never ever die,
God’s river never runs dry,
Children play forever on the hills of
freedom;
No more war, no more pain,
No more parting ever again,
The grass is greener on the other
side,
Where the grass is greener on the
other side.

Oh, this earth with all of its beauty
holds so little,
And if I could leave today, I’ll be
satisfied.
Well I hope that you won’t think
that I’m ungrateful,
But my heart is set on glory,
And my mind is fixed on glory,
Where the grass is greener on the
other side,
Where the grass is greener on the
other side."
862;TRAVELLING ON THE ROAD F;;"We are travelling on the right
road
We are travelling on the right
road,
There is one way to the city of God
We are travelling on the right
road."
863;HE’S BEEN FAITHFUL F;;"In my moments of fears,
Through many pains, many tears,
There’s a God who was faithful to
me;
When my strength was all gone,
When my heart had no song,
Even then God was faithful to me;
Every word He has promised is
true,
What I thought was impossible
I’ve seen my God do.

CHORUS
He’s been faithful, faithful to me.
Looking back, His love and mercy I
see.
Though in my heart, I have
questioned,
Even failed to believe;
Yet He’s been faithful, faithful to
me.

When my heart looked away,
The many times I could not pray,
Still my God, He was faithful to me;
The days I’ve spent so selfishly
Reaching out for what pleased me,
Even then God was faithful to me;
Every time I come back to Him,
He is waiting with open arms,
And I see once again."
864;IT WON'T BE LONG D;;"It won’t be long, soon we’ll be
leaving here,
It won’t be long, we’ll be going
home.

Count the years as months,
Count the months as weeks,
Count the weeks as days,
Any day now, it won’t be long,
We’ll be going home.

We shall be like Him, }3x
In the twinkling of an eye,
In a moment of time,
We’ll be going home."
865;NO OTHER BLOOD D;;"So many years, so many Lambs
were offered up,
But all the blood that was spilt
Could never fill that bitter cup,
Till one spotless Lamb in the
form of man,
Gave His life on Calvary,
His was the only blood that could
ever set me free.

CHORUS
For His blood was not just blood
Of another spotless lamb,
But His blood was precious blood,
For it was to claim back man.
With His blood, He healed my
body
And set my spirit free,
I’m so glad for His precious blood
That still flows from Calvary.

No other blood could heal my
broken body,
No other blood could save my
sin-sick soul,
No other blood can conquer
death
And win the victory,
No other blood, than the blood
He shed for me."
866;JEHOVAH HIDE ME F;;"I am under the Rock,
The Rock is higher than I,
Jehovah hide me,
I am under the Rock.
Go tell my enemy,
I am under the Rock,

I am under the Rock."
867;OH, THE BLOOD OF JESUS F;;"Oh, the blood of Jesus,
Oh, the blood of Jesus;
Oh, the blood of Jesus,
That washes white as snow."
868;HE DROPPED THE CHARGES G;;"CHORUS
He dropped the charges,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Although I was wrong,
He dropped the charges,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Showed me right from wrong,
He dropped the charges,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Cast them all away.

I was guilty of all the charges,
doomed in disgrace,
But Jesus with His special love
saved me by His grace;
He pleaded and He pleaded, He
pleaded my case,
Jesus dropped the charges, Jesus
dropped the charges,
Now I’m saved through grace and
faith.

I was guilty for so long,
Lived in sin too long,
But Jesus with His special love,
Reached down with His arm so
strong;
He picked me up and turned me
around,
Gave me a brand new song,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Now to Him I belong.

We may remember and remember,
All of the things we’ve done,
But Jesus with His special love,
Forgave us of every one;
He put me on the right road,
Lifted my heavy load,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Now I’m free down in my soul.

At Calvary I heard Him say,
At Calvary I heard Him say,
At Calvary I heard Him say,
Case dismissed, case dismissed,
Saved by grace."
869;ONLY JESUS CAN SATISFY C;;"This world may try to satisfy that
longing in your soul,
You may search the whole world
o’er
But you’ll be just as before,
You’ll never find true satisfaction,
Not until you’ve found the Lord,
For only Jesus can satisfy your
soul.

CHORUS
Only Jesus can satisfy your soul,
And only He can change your life
And make you whole.
He’ll give peace you never knew,
Sweet love and joy and heaven too,
For only Jesus can satisfy your soul.

You may have the fame and fortune,
All the wealth you could obtain,
Yet if you have not Christ within,
Your living here would be in vain,
For there’ll come a time when
death shall call you,
Riches cannot help you then,
So come to Jesus, for only He can
satisfy."
870;MY HOUSE IS FULL C;;"There is peace and contentment in
the Father’s house today;
Lots of food on His table and no
one is turned away;
There is singing and laughter as
the hours pass by,
But a hush calms the singing as
the Father sadly cries:

CHORUS
My house is full, but my field is
empty;
Who will go and work for me today?
It seems my children all want to
stay around my table,
But no one wants to work in my
field.}2x

Push away from the table, look out
through the window pane;
Just beyond the house of plenty
lies a field of golden grain;
And it’s white unto harvest, but the
reapers where are they?
In the house, oh, can’t the children
hear the Father sadly say:"
871;NEVER FORSAKEN A;;"Oh, I know you may be weary,
And at times it can get rough,
You may not have all you want
But you always have enough;
And when it seems you’re at the
end,
Just remember what I say,
I’ve never seen the righteous
forsaken
Nor his seed begging for bread.

CHORUS
I’ve never seen God’s people
With a need that He could not
meet,
I know that He cares for His own
And His promises He’ll keep.

Oh, I know it seems so hopeless,
And you don’t know what to pray,
You’ve done all you know you
could
And it seems there’s just no way;
And when your darkest hour would
come,
Just remember what I say,
I’ve never seen the righteous
forsaken
Nor his seed begging for bread.

So just hold on a little longer,
The answer’s soon to come,
The endless waiting almost over,
The victory’s almost won,
And when again you feel this joy
Just remember what I say;
I’ve never seen the righteous
forsaken
Nor his seed begging for bread."
872;THOU ART WORTHY A;;"Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,
Thou art worthy O Lord.
To receive glory, glory and honour,
Glory and honour and power;
For Thou hast created, hast all

And for Thy pleasure they are
created
Thou art worthy O Lord."
873;I JUST CAME SAY TO THANKS C;;"Lord, I didn’t come here
To ask You for anything,
Lord, I just want to say, ""Thank
You Lord.""
You answered a million prayers,
oh God
That I forgot to thank You for,
Lord, I just want to say, ""Thank
You Lord.""

CHORUS
For maybe tomorrow
I’ll have troubles and sorrows,
And a thousand tears may fall,
But until I face tomorrow’s test
I’ll have no special favours to ask
Lord, I just want t o say, ""Thank You
Lord.""

You’ve been so good,
And You’ve been so kind,
I’m so grateful Lord,
I’m so grateful Father,
You kept us in our right minds.
Many times we didn’t know what to
do,
But You always brought us through,
We come today Lord,
We come today Father,
Just to say, ""Thank You Lord.""

You gave us eyes to see,
When we were bound, You set us
free,
We can’t forget Lord,
All of the things that You have
done.
Lord, we travelled by land
And we travelled by air,
I know You kept us Lord,
You kept us from harm, hurt and
danger."
874;I'VE BEEN CHANGED G;;"I've been changed, I've been reborn,
All my life has been rearranged;
What a difference it makes when
the Lord has His way;
All my life, Praise God, has been
changed."
875;WOUNDED SOLDIER D;;"See all the wounded,
Hear all their desperate cry for
help,
They’re seeking for shelter and for
peace.
Our comrades are suffering,
Come let us meet them and their
need
Don’t let the wounded soldier die.

CHORUS
Come let us pour the oil,
Come let us bind the hurt,
Let’s cover them with the blanket
of His love;
Come let us break the bread,
Come let us give them rest,
Let’s minister healing to them;
Don’t let another wounded
soldier die.

Obeying their orders,
They fought on the front line for
their King,
Tearing down the enemy’s
stronghold;
But, weakened from battle,
Satan crept in to steal their lives;
Don’t let the wounded soldiers
die."
876;THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR D;;"Once my heart and soul were
fettered
By the binding chains of sin,
But the great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Blessed be His holy name!
He's the great emancipator,
That's the song of the redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting,
O, so helpless and alone,
But the seeking Shepherd found
me,
Led me to my Father's home."
877;HE'LL DO IT AGAIN A;;"You may feel down and feel like
God has somehow forgotten
That you are faced with
circumstances you can’t get
through;
Right now it seems that there’s
no way out and you’re going
under,
But, God’s proven time and time
again,
He’ll take care of you.

CHORUS
And He’ll do it again,
He’ll do it again,
If you just take a look,
At where you are now,
And where you have been.
For hasn’t He always come
through for you,
He’s the same now as then.
You may not know how,
You may not know when,
But He’ll do it again.

My God knows the pain
You’re going through and He
knows how you’re hurting,
You see, He knows just how
your heart has been broken in
two.
But He’s the God of the stars
and of the sun and of the sea
And He is your Father.
He can calm the storm and find a
way
To take care of you.

BRIDGE
He’s still God
And He will not fail you;
He’s still God
And He cannot change.
Know that He’s God
And He’s fighting for you,
Just like Moses,
Just like Daniel,
Just like Shadrack, Meshack,
Abednego."
878;A GLORIOUS CHURCH D;;"Do you hear them coming brother,
Thronging up the steeps of light,
Clad in glorious, shining garments,
Bloodwashed, garments pure and
white?

CHORUS
'Tis a glorious church without spot
or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb;
’Tis a glorious church without spot
or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb.

Do you hear the stirring anthems,
Filling all the earth and sky,
’Tis a grand victorious army,
Lift its banner up on high!

Never fear the clouds of sorrow,
Never fear the storms of sin,
We shall triumph on the morrow,
Even now our joys begin.

Wave the banner, shout His
praises,
For our victory is nigh;
We shall join our conquering
Saviour,
We shall reign with Him on high."
879;MAKE MY LIFE TO BE G;;"Make my life to be like a melody,
Ever sounding out the message of
the Cross.
Saviour, let me be like a melody,
Ever sounding out the message of
the Cross.

With Jesus in your heart, no
discord can arise,
He can make the saddest heart to
harmonize.
Saviour, let me be like a melody
Ever sounding out the message of
the Cross."
880;RISE AGAIN E;;"Go ahead, drive the nails in my
hand,
Laugh at me, where you stand,
Go ahead, and say it isn’t me,
The day will come, when you will
see.

CHORUS
'Cause I’ll rise again,
Ain’t no power on earth
can tie me down;
Yes, I’ll rise again,
Death can’t keep me
in the ground.

Go ahead, and mock my name,
My love for you is still the same;
Go ahead, and bury me,
But very soon, I will be free.

Go ahead, and say I’m dead and
gone,
But you will see that you were
wrong;
Go ahead, try to hide the Son,
But all will see, that I’m the One."
881;HE IS MY EVERYTHING D;;"He is my everything,
He is my all.
He is my everything,
Both great and small;
He gave Himself for me,
Made everything new;
He is my everything,
None other will do.

Some folks may ask me,
Some folks may say,
Who is this Jesus you talk
about each day?
May I never complain or murmur
Lord;
He is my everything, He is my
all."
882;JESUS MORE THAN EVER D;;"He healed the blind man;
Walked on the water,
And He raised up Jairus
daughter.
He fed the hungry, cleansed the
leper;
But we need Jesus now more
than ever.

CHORUS
Jesus now more than ever,
We are sailing in stormy
weather;
And all His children should get
together,
For we need Jesus now more
than ever.

He touched the lame man and
he started walking;
He touched the dumb man
and he started talking;
He put their lives all back
together,
But we need Jesus now more
than ever.

In the book of Revelation,
We read about the persecution;
We are heading in that direction,
And only Jesus’ blood would give
protection."
883;TRUST IN THE LORD D;;"Trust in the Lord
With all thine heart;
And lean not to thine own
understanding;
But in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him and
He shall direct thy path.

Trust Him, trust Him,
And thou shall find good favour,
and good understanding;
Trust Him, trust Him,
And He shall direct thy path."
884;BECAUSE HE LIVES F;;"God sent His Son, we called Him
Jesus,
He came to love, heal and
forgive,
He bled and died to buy my
pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove
that my Saviour lives.

CHORUS
Because He lives, I can face
tomorrow,
Because He lives, all fears are
gone,
Because I know He holds the
future,
And life is worthwhile living just
because He lives.

And then one day I’ll cross that
river,
I’ll fight life’s final war with Him,
And then as death gives way to
victory,
I’ll see the light of glory for I
know He reigns.

And then in our day, God sent
His prophet,
Just as He promised that He
would send
To prepare a bride for this end
time message,
And Christ in me is there to
prove that His word still lives."
885;I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH C;;"I am the Way, the Truth and the
Life
That’s what Jesus said,
I am the Way, the Truth and the
Life
That’s what Jesus said.
Without the Way there is no
going,
Without the Truth there is no
knowing,
Without the Life there is no living;
I am the Way, the Truth and the
Life
That’s what Jesus said."
886;HE RESTORETH MY SOUL G;;"When I’m low in spirit,
I cry, ""Lord lift me up, I want to
go higher with thee.""
But the Lord knows I can’t live on
the mountain,
So He picked out a valley for me.

CHORUS
He leads me beside still waters,
Somewhere in the valley below;
He draws me aside to be tested
and tried,
But in the valley, He restoreth my
soul.

It's dark like a dungeon and the
sun seldom shines,
And I question, ""Lord, why must
this be?""
But He tells me there’s strength
in my sorrow,
And there’s victory in trials for
me."
887;CAUSE ME TO COME F;;"///Cause me to come to Thy river

drink, cause me to live.

Oh Lord///
Cause me to come, cause me to
drink, cause me to live.

presence, oh Lord///
Cause me to come, cause me to
drink, cause me to live."
888;A SUPERNATURAL PLACE D;;"Lazarus heard a voice though
dead in the tomb,
And Samuel heard the same,
though yet a boy;
We read of Moses and Paul who
were changed in their ways,
They heard the voice of God from
a supernatural place.

CHORUS
Into a supernatural place,
Hearing God’s voice, seeing His
face,
Heavenly words of light have
shone on the bride,
Oh, what a reflection of glory and
grace!
What a reflection of glory and
grace.

In the dark of night, God sent a
light,
To quicken us by the rising of the
Son;
Our gloom is passed away,
We are looking at the day
Thru eyes that see a supernatural
place."
889;GLORIFY HIS NAME G;;"I came to glorify His Name,

I came to glorify the Name of the
Lord,
I came to glorify His Name."
890;HE’S STILL WORKING ON ME D;;"He’s still working on me
To make me what I ought to be.
It took Him just a week to make
the Moon and the Stars, the Sun,
the Earth and Jupiter and Mars.
How loving and patient He must
be,
He’s still working on me."
891;HEADING FOR GLORY D;;"Sometimes I feel lonely on these
shores where I wait,
In this world that You died for
there’s so much evil and hate.
But my cross gets so heavy and my
friends, they are so few,
But Your arms are my shelter and
my eyes are on You.

CHORUS
Heading for glory on a ship coming
in,
You know, gone will be our
heartaches we’ve had now and
then.
Oh, He is coming for His children,
A crown of life they will wear.
Heading for glory on a ship coming
in.

Well you know, soon this battle on
this earth, it shall end.
And we long for that country where
we’ll be free from all sin,
Oh, it seems that I can hear
shouting and it’s coming, it is so
near,
Well it can’t be much longer,
Soon that ship will be here."
892;IN THE NAME OF JESUS C;;"In the Name of Jesus, in the Name
of Jesus,
We have the victory,
In the Name of Jesus, in the Name
of Jesus,
Satan will have to flee.
When we come in the Name of
Jesus,
Tell me who can stand before,
In the precious Name of Jesus,
We shall have the victory."
893;GLORY TO GOD C;;"We are never, never weary of
the grand old song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We can sing it loud as ever,
With our faith more strong:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

a right to shout and sing,
For the way is growing bright and
our souls are on the wing;
We are going by and by to the
palace of a King!
Glory to God, hallelujah!

We are lost amid the rapture of
redeeming love;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We are rising on its pinions to
the hills above:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

We are going to a palace that is
built of gold;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
Where the King in all His
splendour we shall soon behold:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

There we’ll shout redeeming
mercy in a glad, new song;

There we’ll sing the praise of
Jesus with the blood-washed
throng:
Glory to God, hallelujah!"
894;OH WHAT A JOY F;;"Oh, what a joy, O what a joy,
O what a joy in my soul,
It’s Jesus on the inside reflecting
on the outside,

895;WE ARE WELL ABLE A;;"'Twas the Lord of host that led us
out of Egypt’s land:
And He led us through the Red
Sea by His mighty hand,
Never halting in the wilderness.
But His command
Gave us assurance we were
able to possess the land.

CHORUS
We are able to go up and take the
country,
And possess the land from Jordan
to the sea;
And tho giants tall be there our
way to hinder,
God will surely give the victory.

When the spies brought back the
message, this is what they said;
""Against giants and walled cities,
we cannot be led.""
But a Caleb and Joshua said,
""They’ll be as bread:
We are able to go up and possess
the land-ahead.""

When we crossed the river Jordan,
in the land we found;
Wine and oil, and milk and honey,
richest fruits abound;
Sparkling fountains, and the
showers come upon the ground;
We were able, Hallelujah! let
God’s praise resound.

There’s no thirsting for old Egypt,
since we're in this way,
And we care not what the critics or
the ten spies say;
For the land abounds in plenty,
and we're here to stay.
Won’t you come and join us,
brother, enter in today?"

To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope, and peace, and

And baptize every one.

Yes, this power from heaven
descended
With the sound of rushing wind;
Tongues of fire came down upon
them,
As the Lord said He would send.

Yes, this ""old-time"" power was
given
To our fathers who were true;
This is promised to believers,
And we all may have it too."

And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than the snow!
Whiter than the snow!
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,

Father, I have wandered from
Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;

911;SOMETHING GOOD F;;"I just feel like something good is
about to happen,
I just feel like something good is
on its way;
He has promised that He'll open
all of heaven,

very day,
When God's people humble
themselves and call on Jesus;
And they look to heaven
expecting as they pray,
I just feel like something good is
about to happen;
And brother this could be this
very day.

I have learnt in all that happens
just to praise Him,
For I know He’s working all
things for my good,
Every tear I shed is worth the
investment,
For I know He will see me
through,
He said He would;
He had promised eye or ear
could hardly fathom,
All the things He has in store for
those who pray,
I just feel like something good is
about to happen and brother this
could be the very day.

Yes, I've noticed all the bad news
in the papers,
And it seems like things are getting
bleaker every day,
But for the child of God it makes
no difference,
Things are gonna get better any
way,
I have never been thrilled about
tomorrow,
Sunshine always bursting through
the cloud of gray,
I just feel like something good is
about to happen,
And brother this could be the very
day."
912;SIGNS OF THE TIMES D;;"Years of time have come and
gone
Since I first heard it told,
How my Jesus would come to
earth again,
If back then it seemed so real,
Then I just can’t help but feel
How much closer
His coming is today.

CHORUS
Signs of the times are
everywhere,
And there’s a brand new feeling
in the air,
Keep your eyes upon the
Eastern skies,
Lift up your head,
Redemption draweth nigh.

Wars and strife on every hand,
And violence fills our land,
Still some people doubt
That He would come again,
But the word of God is true
He redeemed you chosen few,
Don’t lose hope,
Soon Christ Jesus will descend."

Lord today!
Because You cared for me,

praise.

My heart, my heart,
My soul belongs to You,
You paid the price for me,
Way back on Calvary.
Yes, I’ll praise You; I’ll lift You up,
And I’ll magnify Your Name!
That’s why my heart is filled with
praise."
914;UNTIL THEN F;;"My heart can sing when I pause
to remember,
A heartache here is but a
stepping stone
Along the trail that’s winding
always upward,
This troubled world is not my
final home.

CHORUS
But until then, my heart will go on
singing,
Until then, with joy I’ll carry on.
Until the day mine eyes behold
the city,
Until the day God calls me home.

The things of earth will dim and
lose their value,
If we recall, they’re borrowed for
awhile
And things of earth that cause
the heart to tremble
Remembered there, will only
bring a smile.

This weary world with all its toil
and struggle,
May take its toll of misery and
strife,
The soul of man is like a waiting
eagle
When it’s released, it’s destined
for the sky."
915;THE BLOOD PREVAILS F;;"The blood prevails,
The blood of the bleeding Lamb,
Has power to save,
Just like the olden days,
The blood prevails,

blood,
Praise God for the cleansing
blood,
Praise God for the cleansing
blood,
That washes white as snow."
916;I SEE A CRIMSON STREAM F;;"On Calvary's hill of sorrow
Where sin's demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid.

CHORUS
I see a crimson stream of blood,
It flows from Calvary,
Its waves which reach the throne
of God,
Are sweeping over me.

Today no condemnation
Abides to turn away
My soul from His salvation,
He's in my heart to stay.

When gloom and sadness whisper
You've sinned, no use to pray;
I look away to Jesus,

Where life forever reigns,
The ransomed hosts grand final
Will be this glad refrain."

down here and planning ahead,
So busy with their fortunes,
They forget what Jesus said,
About the wars and earthquakes,
And the fig tree budding leaves,
But there’s a group of people
getting ready to leave.

CHORUS
Ready to leave in the twinkling of
an eye,
Making investments in the bank
up in the sky,
Happy preparations, not a
reason to grieve.
Are you in that number getting
ready to leave?

Sinner, what’s the reason for
your needless delay?
While you’re hesitating Christ
could come just any day.
Heed the Saviour calling, make
your way to Calvary,
And get in that number getting
ready to leave."

was His grace,
I know it was His grace for me;
One day when I was lost, He
died upon the cross,
I know it was His grace for me.

I Know it was His love, I know it
was His love,
I know it was His love for me;
One day when I was lost, He
died upon the cross,
I know it was His love for me.

I Know His Word is true, I know 
His Word is true,
I know His Word is true for me;
One day when I was lost, He

Heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the
tempest;
Glory to His name.

CHORUS
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same;
All may change, but Jesus never!
Glory to His name.
Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
All may change, but Jesus never!
Glory to His name.

He who was the friend of
sinners,
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at His
footstool
penitently bow.
He who said, ""I'll not condemn
thee,
Go and sin no more;""
Speaks to thee that word of
pardon,
As in days of yore.

Oft on earth He healed the
sufferer
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue,
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His
fullness,
Still will give as much.

He who pardoned erring Peter,
Never need'st thou fear;
He that came to faithless
Thomas,
All thy doubt will clear.
He who let the loved disciple
On His bosom rest,
Bids thee still, with love as
tender,
Lean upon His breast.

He who 'mid the raging billows,
Walked upon the sea;
Still can hush our wildest
tempest,
As on Galilee.
He who wept and prayed in
anguish,
In Gethsemane,
Drinks with us each cup of
trembling,
In our agony.

As of old He walked to Emmaus,
With them to abide;
So through all life's way He
walketh,
Ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him,
Hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be ""this same
Jesus,""
As He went away."

Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
It's good enough for me.

It will make you stop your lying;
It will save you when you're dying,
It will start the devil flying;
And it's good enough for me.

It's so good I want no other,
For It makes me love my brother;
And it brings things from under cover,
And it's good enough for me.

(It was good for Paul and Silas...)

undone,
Just look at what sin has done,
Believing the lie Satan told to
Eve that day,
Throwing this world in total

East of Eden no longer to bear,
And they can see driven from
God,
What sin has done.

CHORUS
God, rich in mercy, God, rich in
mercy,
Sent us His Son,
We were undone,
God, rich in mercy.
God, rich in grace, God, rich in
love,
Sent us the best from Heaven
above,
Saying to all men today,
God’s rich in mercy, God’s rich in
mercy.

A prophet God sent to restore
His Word,
As it’s recorded in Malachi 4,
Behold! I will send to you Elijah
before that day,
What sin destroyed, I will restore,
Proving to men God keeps His
word,
Now they can see what I've
revealed,

927;WHO AM I? A;;"When I think of how He came so
far from glory,
Came to dwell amongst the lowly
such as I,
To suffer shame and such
disgrace,
On Mt. Calvary take my place,
Then I ask myself the question,
Who am I?

CHORUS
Who am I that a king would
bleed and die for?
Who am I that He would pray
""not my will but thine Lord?""
The answer I may never know,
Why He ever loved me so,
But to an old rugged cross to go,
Who am I?

When I'm reminded of His Word,
‘I'll leave thee never,
Just be true, I'll give to you a life
forever,’
I wonder what I could have done,
To deserve God’s only Son
To fight my battles till they're
won,
Who am I?"
928;WHO I AM? A;A;"O glorious victory, that day He
set me free,
And made my heart, His very
throne;
My life is no longer mine,
I’m a prisoner of love divine;
And now I live to praise His
Name.

CHORUS
Who I am Lord? Who I am?
I can see now who I am,
A part of my Saviour, a part of His
Word,
It’s a revelation, of who I am.

On Calvary He died, to redeem His
lost Bride;
The King of kings became my
Saviour.
This is God’s great mystery,
Of love expressed to me,
That Christ and I might be made
one."
929;IT IS TRULY WONDERFUL A;;"He pardoned my transgressions,
He sanctified my soul,
He honours my confessions,
Since by His blood I'm whole.

wonderful!
It is truly wonderful what the Lord
has done!
Glory to His name.

He keeps me every moment,
By trusting in His grace,
’Tis thro’ His blest atonement,
That I may see His face.

He brings me through afflictions,
He leaves me not alone;
He's with me in temptation,
He keeps me for His own.

He prospers and protects me,
His blessings ever flow;
He fills me with His glory,
He makes me white as snow.

He keeps me firm and faithful,
His love I do enjoy,
For this I shall be grateful,
And live in His employ.

There's not a single blessing,
Which we receive on earth,
That does not come from
heaven,
The source of our new birth."

weary and sad,
When it seems that my friends

Interceding there for you;

Like servants unto man,
Enslaved by vain traditions,
And a world of self-made plans,
Would we ever be made free,
Be granted liberty,
Or be forced to serve the systems round about us?
But the Bible tells about
A seventh year release,
Where the masters free their servants
If they choose to be set free,
And at the dawning of the day
They could go in their way
Or take the mark of bondage ever to be a slave.

Freedom or bondage,
What would you choose today?
A free man forever,
Or a servant to the grave?
You can have a life anew,
I know God will see you through,

CHORUS
And we are free,
From the chains of any man,
We are free,
And freely we can stand
Before the world and its religions,
And boldly testify, that we are 
bought with a price.
His blood has our sacrifice,
That makes us free for the 
marriage unto Him.
We are free,
Purged and born again,
So rejoice that in our day, the price 
for freedom has been paid.
Who the Son has set free
Is free indeed.

Our name is something different 
now,
Our life is not our own,
We’re united with Jesus Christ,
And Jesus Christ alone,
And there’s no man can take His 
place,
There’s no church we’ll have to face,
Because the voice of God is 
speaking now through us.

And we are free
Like the eagles in the sky
We are free,
So spread your wings and fly,
Don’t look back, don’t turn around,
To Christ we’re Heaven bound,
Who the Son has set free is free 
indeed.

Don’t look back, don’t turn around

He brought me love that only He 
could give;
I brought Him cause to cry.

live,
I taught Him how to die.

Father and said,

I’m not gonna stay,
I’m not gonna pay.”

Hold to God’s unchanging hand!
Build your hopes on things 
eternal,
Hold to God’s unchanging hand!

Trust in Him who will not leave 
you,
Whatsoever years may bring!
If by earthly friends forsaken,
Still more closely to Him cling!

Covet not this world’s vain 
riches,
That so rapidly decay,
Seek to gain the heavenly 
treasures,
They will never pass away!

When your journey is completed,
If to God you have been true,
Fair and bright the home in glory,
Your enraptured soul will view!"
959;ALL IS WELL;F;"All is well, all is well,
We have heard the message 
Shalom! All is well.
There is a place of perfect rest,
Behind the inner veil.
So rest, little Bride rest,
For all is well."
960;IN HIS TIME;D;"In His time, in His time,
He makes all things beautiful
In His time,
Lord, please show me every day,
As You’re teaching me Your 
way,
That You do just what You say,
In Your time."
961;THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME;G;"This world is not my home,
I’m just a’ passing through.
My treasures are laid up,
Somewhere beyond the blue.
The angels beckon me,
From heaven’s open door.
And I can’t feel at home,
In this world anymore.

CHORUS
O Lord, You know,
I have no friend like You,
If heaven’s not my home,
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me,
From heaven’s open door,
And I can’t feel at home
In this world anymore.

They’re all expecting me,
And that’s one thing I know;
I fixed it up with Jesus,
Many years ago.
I know He’ll see me through,
Tho’ I am weak and poor,
And I can’t feel at home,
In this world anymore.

Just over in the glory land,
We’ll live eternally;
The saints on every hand
Are shouting “victory”.
The songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven’s shore,
And I can’t feel at home
In this world anymore."
962;LET THE CHURCH;F;"Let the Church be the Church,
Let the people rejoice,
For we’ve settled the question,
And we’ve made our choice.
Let the anthems ring out,
Songs of victory swell,
For the Church triumphant
Is alive and well."
963;ROBES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS;F;"My soul is now sorrowful as I fore 
an evil day
Lord what must I say shall this cup 
pass away
But here am I in your footprints, 
Lord your son
To this end was I born. So lord thy 
will be done

CHORUS
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord
My soul shall be joyful in my God 
For He has clothed me with his 
garments of salvation
And He has covered me with His 
robes of righteousness.

I’m forsaken and rejected and I’m 
judged by sinful men
Should protest in defense, or in 
anger be tense
When I stand in this grace Lord may 
I behold your dear face 
May the vision hide the shame
Till I see the glory name.

When I’m pressed out and seemed 
defeated 
In the eyes of wicked men, shall you 
grant me deliverance 
And my full Inheritance. When you 
strike me I will speak
And command creation again. That 
the faces of my 
accusers will be greatly ashamed."
964;FOREVER YOU WILL BE;F;"All heaven declares the glory of the 
risen Lord,
Who can compare with the beauty 
of the Lord?

CHORUS
Forever You will be,
The Lamb who died for me,
And I’ll gladly bend my knees,
To worship You alone.

I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lamb
Who once was slain to reconcile 
man to God."
965;THE HEAVENS DO RULE;D;"Oh, the depth of the knowledge 
And the wisdom of the Lord!
His judgements are 
unsearchable,
And His ways past finding out;
Who hath directed His Spirit?
And whose counsel did He take?
For by Him and through Him
Are all things on earth made.

CHORUS
And we know that all things work 
together for our good,
The footsteps of the righteous are 
ordered by the Lord;
Even though things don’t work out
The way we think they should,
Yet we know in all things,
That the heavens surely rule.

Which of us by taking thought 
could add to ourselves?
Why do we yet so many times 
resist His will?
We’ve got to realize salvation is 
wholly of the Lord;
Just stand still and consider
All the wondrous works of God.

There is nothing that happens 
without a real intent,
Our experiences were ordained, 
Our trials have been sent
That we might manifest the purpose
Unto which we have been called,
So in perfect confidence
We can submit to Him our all."
966;HE SIGNED THE DEED;F;"He signed the deed with His 
atoning blood,
He ever lives to make His promise 
sure.
Though all the hosts of hell march 
in;
To make a second claim,
They all march out at the mention 
of His name."
967;THANK YOU FOR THE RAIN;G;"For twenty-three years we have 
been looking
For God to send the revival 
amongst us;
Wednesday the 3rd of June we 
received our inheritance claim;
Now we know the New Name
And we are not hollering again, 
and again, and again
And again.

CHORUS
Thank You Lord for sending   } 
the rain, (Hallelujah)      }2x
We thank you again and again, 
And again and again and again,
We thank You.

All false branches must be cut 
off,
For the tree must be pruned and 
cleaned,
For it’s the Holy Spirit that is 
planting the life within us
Because He knows that we are 
the Bride, are the Bride, are the 
Bride, are the Bride.

Many families, they were 
attached to this Word
But they were under man’s 
teaching;
When our shepherd waved the 
wave-sheaf over them,
Then they realized they are not 
shuck, but they are seed, they 
are seed, they are seed, they are 
seed"
968;I LOVE HIM;C;"I love Him, I love Him,
Because He first loved me,
And purchased my salvation on 
Calvary’s tree."
969;TURN ON THE LIGHT;F;"A people that once sat in 
darkness saw a marvelous light,
The light of God’s revealed Word 
flashed across our hearts
And we have been made whole.
Now we walk in the light as He is 
in the light,
Having fellowship one with the 
other,
God’s blood that cleanses and 
His love that conquers.

CHORUS
There’s a man here that can turn 
on the light, 
There’s a man here that can turn 
on the light, 
So If you’re in darkness, cannot 
find your way,
There’s a man here that can 
show you the way.

In the beginning was the Word 
and the Word was with God,
And the Word was made flesh 
and dwelt among us,
The light of God’s revealed Word
Face to face we see now,
Almighty God unveiled before us,
The Lamb that was slain, who 
took the Book
And showed us our names.

King Theophany Jesus that is 
walking in and amongst us,
God En Morphe for the final turn 
at the west.
So when you look, what do you 
see now?
It depends on what you’re 
looking for,
We are a people that have been 
set free,
Living epistles that can show you 
the door."
970;PAST THE CURTAIN OF TIME;D;"There’s a curtain that’s drawn 
between earth and Heaven,
And just beyond lies a beautiful 
clime
Where the evils of this life no 
longer can touch me;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
of time.

CHORUS
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
of sorrows and fear,
Let me view that sunny bright 
clime;
It would strengthen my faith and 
would banish all fear;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
of time.

I’m helpless, alone, and I want to 
see Jesus,
And hear the sweet harbor bells 
chime,
Where my friends and dear loved 
ones are waiting for me;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
of time.

I’m so homesick and blue, and I 
want to see Jesus,
I would like to hear those sweet 
harbor bells chime;
It would brighten my path and 
would vanish my fear;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
of time."
971;HE IS HERE HALLELUJAH;C;"He is here, hallelujah!
He is here, amen!
He is here, holy, holy!
I will bless His name again;
He is here, listen closely,
Hear Him calling out your name;
He is here, you can touch Him,
You will never be the same"
972;A GIFT OF GRACE;C;"A Gift of Grace was all it took
To redeem me again back to His 
own;
I’ve been redeemed, He saved my 
soul,
My Saviour paid the price,
Now I’m no more my own.

CHORUS
So seek on Saints,
Seek till you’re filled with  power;
Seek on saints
Till His Spirit in you is  endowed,
It’s been revealed,
This is the final hour;
And soon His Bride, His Chosen 
One
Will go on home.

Unmerited the favour that He 
granted me
To bring me home today, His very 
Own;
’Twas love, ’twas Grace
That stooped so low to conquer 
me;
My Sovereign Lord gave 
Sovereign Grace
To redeem me.

And now I’m home, His robe’s 
wrapped around me;
This land is mine, this Promise is 
for me.
Amazing grace, amazing love
Christ poured on me,
His Word went with a promise,
One day we shall meet"
973;I WILL PRAISE THE LORD;D;"I will praise the Lord,
I will praise the Lord,
No matter what tomorrow brings,
What it has in store,
I will praise the Lord"
974;PRAISE YE THE LORD;Bb;"Praise ye the Lord all ye people!
Praise Him for His goodness, 
His majesty and power;
For His merciful kindness is 
great towards us,
And His righteousness endureth 
forever.

CHORUS
He’s the Lord of creation,
He’s the Rock of our salvation,
He paid the price for our 
redemption,
And He is worthy, (so worthy)
He is our comfort in times of 
sorrow,
Our strength to face tomorrow,
Our refuge in times of trouble,
And He alone is worthy to be 
praised.

Give thanks unto Him and serve 
Him,
For He forgiveth all thy sins,
And healeth all thy diseases,
Who redeemeth you from a life 
of destruction,
And crowneth you with loving 
kindness and tender mercies.

BRIDGE
We have so much to praise and 
thank Him for,
Our lives are testimonies 
And so many great things He 
has done.
Forget not His love and His 
promises,
For He has promised a new 
Heaven, 
A new Earth and a new Body.

Praise Him, praise Him,
For He alone is worthy to be
praised,
Praise Him, praise Him,
For He alone is worthy to be 
praised,
So all you got to do is praise 
Him, praise Him.
For He alone is worthy to be 
praised,
Praise Him, praise Him.
For He alone is worthy to be 
praised,
For He alone is worthy to be 
praised."
975;FILL MY WAY WITH LOVE;F;"Let me walk, blessed Lord, in the 
way Thou hast gone,
Leading straight to the land 
above;
Giving cheer everywhere, to the 
sad and the lone,
Fill my way every day with love.

CHORUS
Fill my way every day with love,
As I walk with the heavenly 
Dove;
Let me go all the while, with a 
song and a smile,
Fill my way every day with love.

Keep me close to the side of my 
Saviour and Guide,
Let me never in darkness rove;
Keep my path free from wrath, 
and my soul satisfied,
Fill my way every day with love.

Soon the race will be o'er and I’ll 
travel no more,
But abide in my home above;
Let me sing, blessed king,
All the way to the shore
Fill my way every day with love."
976;PEACE PEACE;F;"Peace! peace! wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father 
above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I 
pray,
In the fathomless billows of love."
977;PARENTAL CARE;C;"You loved me when I was so 
unlovable
You died for me when I wasn’t 
worth dying for
You taught me real Godliness; is 
with contentment
And that my trials only come to 
bring me patience

Truly your ways is not like our ways 
And your thoughts like our thoughts
Yet you chip and you mold me to 
Bring me into your image

CHORUS
Truly your love is not parental care 
for a baby 
But your love truly is elective love 
You may cause me to suffer like Job 
Or to be delivered unto to death like 
Paul
But yet in the midst of the all 
you’re just 
Proving how much you really, 
really, really
Love me

You taught me when I’m weak, that 
I’m strong
And the only way up is down
In order to live in your presence, I 
must die
Your love is simply amazing who 
could deny

BRIDGE
Whosoever the Lord loveth, He 
chasteneth 
And if we are without chastisement 
We are not of His. 
Now no chastisement for the present 
Seemeth joyous but then it brings 
forth 
the peaceable fruits of righteousness"
978;WE ARE STANDING;C;"When I walked through the door
I felt His presence
And I know this is the place
Where love abounds;
And this is the temple, Jehovah 
God abides,
And we are standing in His 
presence
On Holy ground.

CHORUS
We are standing on holy ground
And I know that there are Angels 
all around;
Let us praise Jesus now,
For we are standing in His 
presence
On Holy ground.

In His presence, 
There is joy beyond all measure;
At His feet, peace of mind can 
still be found,
So if you have a need, 
I know He has the answer,
So reach out and touch Him,
For we are standing on holy 
ground."
979;THIS IS THE HOLY GROUND;C;"This is holy ground,      }
We’re standing on holy round,}
For the Lord is here;             }
And where He is, is holy.         }2x

These are holy hands,    
We’re lifting up holy hands,  
For the Lord is here   
And where He is, is holy. 
These are holy hands,   
We’re lifting up holy hands,  
For the Lord is here 
And where He is, is holy."
980;ARISE AND POSSESS;C;"CHORUS
Arise, possess your inheritance,
For this is the year of jubilee,
Arise, be not entangled with the 
yoke of bondage.
Understand the liberty by which 
Christ set you free.

Entangled with heavy chains of 
captivity,
Bruised and battered by sin,
Condemned and sentenced to a 
life of bondage,
O God, there was no peace 
within.
Then a sound was heard,
It was like the abundance of rain,
Saying “Rejoice, you have 
received the atonement,
Accept the pardoning word which 
was provided for you,
Because you’re not of the 
bondwoman,
You’re of the free.”

Aren’t you tired of living 
underprivileged?
Saints, don’t you, don’t you hear 
that sound?
Saying freedom to the captives,
Restoration to the blind,
Setting free those who are 
bruised.
Saints, empty your vessels,
Let Him fill them with oil,
You are free, you are free, you 
are free.
So when the creditor comes to 
take away your land,
Show him your account
Settled long ago by Calvary’s 
Lamb,
And say, “I am free, I am free, I 
am free.” 

Now I can tell the world that I’m 
free,
I have heard the trumpet sound
Jubilee; Freedom from all 
burdens and sin,
The Comforter has given me 
peace within.
///And whom the Son has set 
free, is free indeed.///"
981;GOING HOME;F;"CHORUS
I'm going home in the morning,
I'm going home, it won't be long,
I'm going home, it won't be long.

Can't afford to get my line 
tangled in these kind of times,
So I'm looking nine times before 
I make one step,
Don't want to be caught
In an unconscious state of mind,
For I want to leave this earth
In the twinkling of an eye.

I'm going to slip from time into 
eternity,
I'm going to become one with my 
Theophany,
Going to live in that mansion
God has prepared for me,
I'm going to leave this pest-house 
for eternity.

We're going to be reunited with  our 
loved ones
Who have gone on before to 
another dimension;
Soon we'll see Him face to face,
The One who lives inside our 
hearts;
Who saved us by His amazing 
grace,
We'll be with Him never to depart.

Could it be between six or nine?
Whatever the time
I want to be ready to meet my 
Bridegroom."
982;THIS THE YEAR OF JUBILEE;C;"This is the year of Jubilee,
This is the year of Jubilee,
When all the captives are set free
Come ye halt, ye blind, ye lame,
Leap and shout for joy again,
This is the year of Jubilee......."
983;I'LL FLY AWAY;G;"Some glad morning when this life 
is over, 
I'll fly away,
To a home on God's celestial 
shore
I'll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away, O, glory! I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah! by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows of this life have 
grown,
I'll fly away;
Like a bird from prison bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more weary days and 
then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys shall never 
end,
I'll fly away."
984;PART OF HIS BRIDE;G;"He leads me through troubled 
waters,
He holds my hands through 
darkest sky;
He comforts me when my heart is 
laden down with grief,
He's coming back to take me away 
as His bride.

CHORUS
For I'm His bride, I'm His only 
loved one,
I'm His chosen, His fair one, His 
dove;
For I was predestined, 
In His grace, I now abide.
What an honour, oh, how 
marvelous, what a privilege,
Thank You Jesus, I'm part of Your 
bride.

Before the world, He knew me in 
glory,
Before the sun, I lived and reigned 
with Him;
Now my soul longs to see Him,
On the clouds that He rides,
Coming back to rapture me as His 
bride."
985;WHEN THE REDEEMED;F;"I am thinking of the rapture in our 
blessed home on high,
When the redeemed are 
gathering in
How we'll raise the heavenly 
anthem in that city in the sky,
When the redeemed are 
gathering in.

CHORUS
When the redeemed are 
gathering in,
Washed like the snow, and free 
from all sin;
How we will shout and how we 
will sing, 
When the redeemed are 
gathering in.

There will be a great procession 
over on the streets of gold,
When the redeemed are 
gathering in;
O what music, O what singing,
o'er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed are 
gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption's 
story with their voices clear and 
strong,
When the redeemed are 
gathering in;
Then the angels all will listen,
For they cannot join that song,
When the redeemed are 
gathering in.

Then the Saviour will give orders 
to prepare the banquet board,
When the redeemed are 
gathering in;
And we'll hear His invitation, 
""Come, ye blessed of the Lord,""
When the redeemed are 
gathering in."

We'll reach the shores of 
Eternity, 
We are like ships sailing across 
life's troubled sea,   
But with our compass set on the 
North Star 
We'll reach the shores of 
Eternity.

Contrary winds of doctrine blew 
against us on the way,
But we set our eye on the Captain,
Listened to what He had to say.
Many ships were tossed to and fro 
ad were driven off their course,
But we are thankful to our Captain,
We aren't shipwrecked, we aren't lost.
He said, ""Peace be still.""     }
To see the glory of the Lord you} 
must stand still.       } 2x

We are sailing through many 
rough waters,
Using our paddles skillfully,
Now we are faced with 
treacherous conditions,
We need the Master of the sea
To say ""Peace be still.""
To see your troubles end, you 
must stand still;
He'll say, ""Peace be still.""
To see the glory of the Lord you 
must stand still.

Upon the distant shore, there's a 
land that's shining bright;
Soon we'll reach that golden shore
And be welcomed by the Prince of 
Light.
He'll say, ""Peace be still,
My light has led you to do My 
perfect will.""
He'll say, ""Peace be still,""
And when we see Him face to face 
We must stand still."
988;BRIDGE TO HEAVEN;F;"Left the splendour of His throne,
Came down to earth,
Had one purpose in His mind.
Tempted in all points as we are
Yet without sin,
Most worthy High Priest,
He's the Supreme Sacrifice.

CHORUS
He is the bridge from Earth to} 
Heaven,      } 2x
We now live in God's presence 
forever.
I'll always look to Calvary where 
Redemption price was paid for me,
There on the cross, crucified with 
Him.

There on the cross I was in Him,
There on the cross I paid for my sin,
And His glory, I now boldly enter 
in.
Lift your eyes to Calvary, see 
where He has set you free,
Loosed from the grips of sin and 
shame.

Sin has no more dominion over 
you,
You're ordained to do just what 
you do,
He's that bridge to Heaven for me 
and you.

To the splendour of His throne,
His Bride now leaves the Earth,
Quickening power now breaks the 
hold of time;
Travelling faster than the speed of 
light,
We'll be changed in the twinkling 
of an eye,
And that bridge to Heaven will be 
no more."
989;I'M GLAD HE SET ME FREE;A;"I'm so glad Jesus set me free,}3x

We must dwell in unity
So we're showing our love to Him,
Having a blameless testimony
A life that's holy and free from  sin;
We should be an example
To the lost who know not the  way:
We're not children of the night  but 
of the day,
So let us show them the way.

With the joy of the Lord
And the strength of our youth,
Let's be zealous to do God's  will;
Fleeing youthful lusts and 
pressing to be
Empty vessels that God can fill.
We should never lean to our own 
understanding,
Casting our reasoning down,
So we'll be better able to love 
and serve Him."
991;WE'LL GIVE THE GLORY;A;"We'll give the glory to Jesus

Jerusalem,
Knowing that very soon the

Only You, only You      }
Can quench this thirst        }
in my soul.   } 2x

Many nights I can't sleep, everyday 
my soul groans in me,
Waiting for the redemption of this 
body;
No matter what the world may say, 
No matter what the world may do,
It's a fact that I can't rest until I'm 
perfect.

Before the Masterpiece could 
speak it must be smitten
By the determinate counsel of our 
God,
What shall I say then, 'Father take 
this cup from me?'
But nevertheless not my will but 
Thine be done.

Signs of the time quickly 
approaching,
We can see the whole creation is 
groaning;
But, for this purpose came we into 
this world;
To fulfill what is written of us."
993;MORE THAN EVER BEFORE;C;"More than ever before,

994;WHAT WILL YOU PRESENT;C;"I want to present the life of  Christ,
It's my aim today,
For in His image I want to stand
So blameless on that day;
And though this world may  criticize,
It will never understand,
That I can't rest until I be
A perfect man.

CHORUS
What are you going to present to 
the Lord
At the end of your journey?
He's not going to be touched by 
anything
Save His testimony.
What are you going to present to  the 
Lord?
I hope it makes you sigh and cry,
Don't be found in that position
Where you would be wondering why.

Though the world may offer its 
pleasure and peace,
And its luxurious life of ease,
But it simply cannot continue on
For man's just like a breeze;
A moment here and a moment gone,
Like a flower he fades away,
But I just want to stay right on
To that perfect day.

Take rest my soul, in no other arms
Save Jesus own today
For He has opened my eyes to see
That judgement is on its way;
And though ten thousand fall at my 
side
I will never be tossed aside;
For in the shadow of that mighty 
rock is where I'll abide.

Lord take Thy Word, Thy  precious
Word,
And anoint it to my soul;
Perfect what is lacking in  my faith
And make thy servant whole.

For I just want to hear You say,
""Receive thy crown my beloved  son
You have overcome, well done!"""
995;WHEN THE SAINTS GO;C;"I'm a pilgrim and a stranger
Wand'ring through this world of sin,
On my way to that fair city,
When the Saints go marching in.

CHORUS
When the saints go marching in,}2x
Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in.

Oh, I know I'll see my Saviour
If my life is free from sin,
Heaven's doors will open for me
When the Saints go marching in.

When we gather 'round the Throne
And the gates are closed within,
I'll be shouting ""Glory, Glory""
When the Saints go marching in.

I'm waiting for the chariot
To swing low and I'll step in,
On the clouds I'll ride to Heaven
When the Saints go marching in."
996;JESUS WOLL TAKE CARE;C;"Have you ever been so distressed
When you see your circumstances 
look so gloomy,
And the tears begin to cover your 
eyes?
Remember Jesus will take care of 
you.

CHORUS
He's the Rock of all the ages,
He's the light in the darkest night,
A comfort when there's no one left 
to care;
So you don't look at your 
circumstances,
They will only bring you down,
Remember Jesus will take care of 
you.

When you feel so weak and can't 
go on;
And the devil, he tempts you so sore;
But if you only call upon Jesus, 
He will answer,
For He knows that you're weak on 
your own."
997;MANY WATERS;G;"There are so many people
in the world today
Don't really know what 
true love is;
Many have searched the 
whole wide world
And still can't seem 
to find it.
Love is patient, love is kind,
True love can never be broken;
Love beareth all things, 
Love suffers long.
Love is God and God is love,
Who is our King;
But how can you know true love
Without knowing Him?

CHORUS
Many waters cannot        }
quench love,       }
Neither can the floods     }
drown it,           }3x
Whosoever God joins    
together,         
Let no man put asunder.

Therefore shall a man leave 
father and mother
And cleave unto his wife,
Then they shall be no more twain 
But they shall be one.
Then he'll love his bride as Christ 
the church,
Who giveth Himself for it;
For no man yet hateth his flesh,
But loveth and cherisheth it.
Love is God and God is love,
Who is our King;
So how can you know true love
Without knowing Him?"

world,
To whom this Message must be 
told;
All those honest in heart,
In this light they have a part.

CHORUS
You've got to run, run, run, run,
Run with the Message of 
Malachi 4,
You've got to tell it like you've 
never told it before;
Let him that readeth run,
Let him that heareth run,
For this Message is the coming 
of the Lord.

Always ready to give a  reason,
Be instant in and out of season,
Willing to take this blessed  hope
To a lost and dying world.

Seeing we have this ministry,
Let's not faint but earnestly
Seek to build the kingdom of 
God,
For the glory of the Lord."

Be strong in the Lord, 
Be empowered,
Through your union with Him
Draw all your strength,
Put on the armour that God 
supplies,
That you, you may be able to 
stand.

We're not wrestling with flesh 
and blood,
Contending with physical things,
But we're standing in faith,
Against the rulers of this world;
Empowered by His spirit,
In the authority of His name.

Having shod your feet
With the Good News of peace,
Girding your loins with His truth,
The breastplate of righteousness
And the helmet of salvation;
The shield of faith and the sword 
of the Spirit.

Now standing complete in His 
image,
Refusing to be shaken from your 
place,
Praying at all times in the Spirit 
of the Lord,
Interceding on behalf of all the

Just remember the good things He 
has done,
Things that seemed so impossible,
We praise Him for the victories we 
have won!"
1005;ONE LOVE;F;"CHORUS
One love, one love, one love, one 
love.

There was a time in the history of 
man
When he commanded the 
creation
And he and his Maker had one 
love;
And then the deceiver came,
And man lost the power of the 
Name,
For he had broken the bond of 
one love;
It then took the blood of a 
spotless lamb
To be an atonement for fallen
man
It was God's substitute for his sin 
and shame ;
It was a part of God's great 
mystery
To redeem you and me again,

Back to ................} chorus
Then one day the real Lamb 
came,
He came in the Father's Name
To be a ransom for one love.
When on the cross my Saviour 
died,
The power of death He had 
defied,
To give us the token of one love.
He then changed our destiny,
He could now come and live in 
you and me,
Making us creatures now bound 
for eternity;
Brothers and sisters can't you 
see,
He died to set you and I free
again!
Back to .............} chorus

The Holy Ghost the Lord did send,
He fell upon some redeemed men,
They had the token and one love.
They baptized in Jesus Name;
And of His doctrine they weren't 
ashamed,
For they were believers in one 
love.
But then as the ages rolled away
From this doctrine evil men did 
stray;
And the serpent began to ride this 
trail again.
Beware of the creeds of wicked 
men,
Designed to bring us back to 
bondage again;
But we want .......} chorus

In the end time the Son of man
came,
He came in His Father's Name
To give us the token of one love.
Seven Thunders sounded in our 
souls,
Our Lord had gathered us from 
this wicked world
To be united in one love;
Then we will speak and command 
creation again,
Sons and daughters in the 
Father's Name,
Having power and wrapped up in 
His love;
The trumpet shall sound
And we'll take our flight to the 
skies
To be in glory where we'll be with

1007;BE IDENTIFIED;G;"What does it profit a man to follow
The vain traditions of misguided 
men,
Who try to establish a 
righteousness of their own;
A propitiation for their sins?

BRIDGE
O tell me,
What do you think of the blood of 
Jesus
That was shed for you?
Is it sufficient to pardon you from 
sin
(Is it sufficient to purge your 
conscience from sin,)
(Is it sufficient to give you 
dominion over sin,)
Set you free, putting peace within?

CHORUS
Just be identified with your 
sacrifice
To be really justified, look to the 
place where Jesus died;
Be identified, really justified, 
Look to the place where Jesus 
died.

What can a man do to be justified?
What does it take for an angry God 
to be pacified?
If you trust in your power, or 
struggle with all your might,
Yet your righteousness is like filthy 
rags in God's sight.

What a work of grace that a man 
could clearly see
The Lamb with seven horns and 
seven eyes,
When darkness covers the earth 
and death begins to strike
In the place where the blood has 
not been applied!
BRIDGE
What do you think of the opening 
of those Seals,
God's provided way for you?
Is it sufficient? Then, don't add or 
take away;
It's God's provided way to save 
you in this day.
What a work of power the blood has 
done for you and me,
Lifting us from a life of sin, turning 
our bodies heavenly.
And when Satan tries to convict you 
in the courts of memory,
Hear the Lamb return the verdict: 
""Not guilty, not guilty!"" 
(""Not guilty, you are free!"")"

Beulah Land, I'm longing for you!
And someday on thee I'll stand,
There my home shall be eternal,
Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.

I'm looking now across that river
To where pain is going to end 
inside,
Now just a few more days to 
labour;
Then I shall take my heavenly 
flight."

1010;COME WHAT MAY;F;"He didn't say that it was going to 
be easy;
Every promise my Lord has made
We've got to fight to claim.
For as many as He called, 
He gave the power to overcome;
And every devil that stands before 
us
Must be on the run!
So why should I ever think it 
strange
When fiery trials should come my 
way?
For He said that if I do suffer for 
His Name,
With Him I shall reign.

CHORUS
Come what may, with Your Word I 
will stay,
Come what may, I'll press through 
anyway;
Come what may, Lord have Your 
way.

I'll consider Him 
Who for the joy that was set before 
Him,
The cross He endured;
And that same life now dwelleth 
within me
Victory I'm assured.
For He did say, He'll never leave 
me nor forsake me,
And as a seed of Abraham
I'll possess the gates of my 
enemies!
Why should I ever think it  strange
When fiery trials should come  my 
way?
For He said that if I do suffer for 
His Name
With Him I shall reign.

As I journey along,
May Lord I ever be, courageous 
and strong;
For inch by inch I'll possess the 
land
For I'm a journeyman,
By striving lawfully,
Knowing Thou savourest 
reverence and humility;
Let the fullness of that meal  offering
Be displayed in me!
I should never ever think it 
strange
When fiery trials should come  my 
way,
For You said that if I do suffer  for 
Your Name,
With You I shall reign.

When I am down on the ground,
May I press through like a lily
In spite of the muck all around;
Rejoicing in the glory wherein You 
have clothed me.
When I am up in the air
And the strong winds blow,
May I ever know that You are 
there;
But if I be like a wounded dove,
May I press through with Your 
message of Love.
For I no longer ever think it 
strange
When fiery trials should come  my 
way;
For I know that if I do suffer for 
Your Name
Lord, with You I shall reign."

1012;LET THE RAIN COME DOWN;C;"We are living in these last days,
In a harassing and a thirsty age.
God sent Elijah His prophet

the rain.

CHORUS
Let the rain come down,
Let the thunder roll,
Filling me up, let me overflow
Till I can take no more;
Filling me up, let me overflow
Till I can take no more.

When you are a seed of God,
You've got to be planted in the 
Word to die;
Your body might decay here in the 
Earth.
But it will spring to life with  eternal 
growth.

In these last days we are living in,
We know that the life which is in us 
will spring again,
As small as a mustard seed, 
saints, it will grow;
As big and wide with branches 
flowing on the other side!
I want the former and the latter 
rain to reign in you;
I want the former and the latter 
rain to reign in me;
I want the former and the latter 
rain to reign in you;
I want the former and the latter 
rain to reign in me.

I want the rain to come and give 
me Faith,
I want the rain to come and give 
me Virtue,
Let the rain come and give me 
Knowledge,
I want the rain to give me 
Temperance,
Let the rain come and give me 
Patience,
I want the rain to give me 
Godliness,
Let the rain come and give me 
Brotherly Kindness,
And Charity that the Super anointing power could be seen in 
me.

Now I know I'm part of Him;
Soon He'll come and take me

And what joy now fills her  lover's 
heart!
As He beholds His lovely Bride at 
last;
And with joy will the angels sing,
What adoration from the Seraphim!
Objections considered, all 
hollering will cease,
All other women will have to hold 
their peace;
He whispered to us in a language 
unknown,
And now the beauty of His Bride 
will be shown.

Oh, the mystery that the two have 
now become one,
And the victory of all ages is finally 
won;
Flesh of His flesh, bone of His 
bone, we are the same,
United we stand under that special 
name.
The Lamb takes His wife by the

Humble woman, He has chosen

Will sit with Him as Queen upon

In the beautiful garden of Eden;
When God made man and placed 
him 
Over the earth to have dominion,
But He saw man was alone,
He had no one to share his home.

So God put man into a sleep
And took from his side,
One of his ribs close to his heart
With which He formed his bride.
His missing rib has been restored,
His missing rib was in bride form.

This bride has come all dressed in 
white,
A veil she has put on.
She's come to stand at the side of 
him
Whom she was taken from.

His missing rib has been restored,
His missing rib is in bride form."
1018;WE ARE GOING OUT;F;"A prophet like unto Moses came  to
us in this day,
Vindicated with signs and  wonders,

And God has Joshua on the  scene;
So be thou strong and of good 
courage,
As He was with Moses, 
So He'll  be with thee.
CHORUS
For we are the children going
Out of Egypt's land,
We are the children marching 
Into the promised land;
We are the children crossing over.
The Ark is going before us,
We are the children going out
In this Third Exodus.

Oh children, let's all be ready,
Heed to all that God commands;
Let us obey all His instructions
To enter into the promised land
He is the captain of our salvation,
Defeated all our enemies.
Do not be fearful, just be

He is the leader as we march to 
victory."
1019;ANCIENT OF DAYS;D;"I beheld in the courts of Heaven
Where great treason was opposed:
Michael fought the great red Dragon

They mingled the seed of men,
And by deceit, they gained control,
Until...

And we must overcome.

MONOLOGUE
I beheld this same dragon on 
the earth was a dreadful beast:
He plundered and devoured,
having kings to bow at his feet.
But, I beheld till the Prince of 
Princes came,
Great Michael, en morphe
As the bloody Lamb that was 
slain,
He brought to us the victory.
He is....

I beheld this beast was wounded
But his deadly wound was healed:
He cast down the truth, exalted a 
lie,
Having the whole world to be 
deceived.
I beheld till a Mighty Angel came
With an open book in His hand,
He gave me skill and wisdom to 
understand
God's great mystery plan.

I stood in the ranks of a great 
army,
They were the saints of the most

We fought the dragon and 
overcame
By Michael's two-edged sword."

Elijah has come, he has done his 
work already,
As John has said,

And now we are waiting
For the coming of Jesus,
What a blessed day
When the Lamb shall take us.

Our hopes are bright, 
Our lamps are burning,
And day by day our hearts are

This is the evening;
He will come in the morning,
Then we shall wait until that

Even Seven Angels coming in a 
Cloud
Bringing back redemption for me
Opening up the Lamb's book of

And all the hidden mysteries,
And I know that we have eaten 
the Book,
What a people we should be!
And when I see another corn of 
wheat
Coming to a mature stage,
And this is the day of redemption
And the price has been paid;
Yet I see the things You've 
promised
Missing in my life,
Oh how I want to lose my life,
So your Life could be  }
wrapped up in mine.     } 2x

For I'm tired living  underprivileged
When I see what God has done;
I'm tired living as a servant
When it's time for manifested 
sons.
Lord, You gave revival and
And you promised the Third Pull

There are souls under the altar,
They are crying out 'how long

Sleeping saints, they are anxiously
Awaiting on the resurrection.
In my heart there is a cry
To go back to that place,
No more darkly in a mirror
But seeing face to face.
The whole creation is groaning,
Waiting on that sweet release;
The lion wants to lay down with the 
lamb
For a thousand years of peace;
And I want to see the One
Who has been with us all the  time;
But still I want to lose my life
So His Life could be wrapped   }
up in mine.        } 2x

A new day has dawned
And I just can't go on this way,
Just saying that I'm a Christian,
Walking with my Bible everyday,
The Prophet said the true church 
would write
Another Book of Acts,
And if I don't come back to that 
place
Then I have missed the mark.
But between revivals the locks 
have grown,
There is a possibility;
The meal has been placed upon 
the sticks
To be baked into reality,
Faith to use the power
Is growing greater all the time.
So like Samson: Just once more 
Lord,
Like Esther: If I perish I perish  Lord,
Like Jonah: to do Your bidding Lord,
Like Joseph: to be a prisoner;
For the greater works we   }
have to do.        } 2x"

In the dust of the ground;
A pearl of great price,
A jewel for my crown.
The gentle look in her eyes,

She's like an Easter flower
That the Rock of ages did 
shelter;
Her beauty, her character is
undefiled.

CHORUS
And she is my bride,
She is my virtuous wife;
She is my bride
Today and forever.

I've suffered much pain
Before I could take my claim,
But she was chosen long ago to 
bear my name.
We shared years of intimacy,
She was the great mystery in 
me;
She is flesh of my flesh
And bone of my bone.

MONOLOGUE
I believe, ""blessed is the man 
who can find a virtuous wife,"" 
for we live in a time when the 
daughters of men are fair. But 
what is beauty without 
character anyway?... Just 
vanity..... So sons of God, turn 
your eyes away from that wild 
stare. Look for the virtues of 
sacred motherhood..... a meek 
and quiet spirit which is 
precious in the sight of the 
Lord ...... And such virtues you 
can only find in the daughters 
of God ...... who, like Leah and 
Rachel, will build the house of 
Israel, raising sons and 
daughters of God.... would 
worship the Lord and bless 
His Holy Name..... When 
you've  found such a woman, 
then you  can truly say......

My love will keep her all the way,
At my side she'll always stay,
For we're united by my promises;
I'll keep my word.
She'll never be alone
Together we'll share our future 
home,
My queen will sit with me upon 
my throne.

BEHOLD THE LAMB    E
About two thousand years ago
When John was on the earth,
Sent by God to pave the way
For the Saviour of this world:
And as he introduced the 
Messiah
To the people there,
When he saw Jesus coming unto 
Him,
This is what He said.

CHORUS
""Behold the Lamb
Who taketh away the sin of this 
world!""
Behold the Lamb
Has taken away, has taken away 
my sin.

Israel suffered serpent stings
When they provoked the Lord,
God's mercy caused the brazen 
serpent
To be lifted up;
And as for healing, it was lifted
In the wilderness,
So Jesus Christ was lifted
So we could look and live.

In the beginning was the Word,
Then, taking fleshly form,
Was manifested through
Jesus Christ
And lifted on the cross:
And through the opening of 
those Seven Seals
We see so plain,
Just for our redemption, He's 
lifted up again."
1026;SAIL ON;F;"Morning cometh and also the 
night,
Gross darkness upon the earth;
Many are wandering to and fro
And knowledge has increased.
But make sure your anchor holds 
my friend,
And keep your eyes upon the 
North Star
'Cause He promised never to 
leave us;
He's the author and the finisher.

CHORUS
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on,
Land ahoy!
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.

A royal priesthood we are,
A peculiar people,
A holy generation 
That comes from every nation.
And the captain of the Lord's 
host is on our side,
With a flaming sword in His hand
To protect us as we go by.

We've been travelling six 
thousand years,
Going back to Eden.
Soon it wouldn't be long, 
We'll soon see our Promised 
Land.
Standing fast in the liberty
Wherein Christ has made us 
free,
Holding our confession to the 
end;
Lady Liberty.

We're sailing through rugged, 
jagged seas
With thunders, lightning and 
blasts;
Pressing through with all our might
To see God's Word come to pass.
If we perish, we perish,
But we're going to see our King,
Laying our lives on the line,
Knowing that we are nothing."
1027;GOD'S EAGLES;F;"I lived in a world of sin and 
shame
That only caused me grief and 
pain,
And I tried so hard to be free,
Searching for my true identity,
Didn't know I came from  eternity,
Until God came and revealed it 
to me.

CHORUS
On the wings of a    }
snow-white Dove,   }
God sent His pure   }
sweet love,        }
On the wings of a   }
snow-white Dove      }
To take His eagle   }
home.       }2x

I knew somehow I was born to fly
Way up in the sky,
But somehow I couldn't set my 
wings free;
But since that day I heard His 
voice
And made Him my heavenly 
choice,
By His grace I can say I've  been
set free.

Now behold what manner of love
The Father hath bestowed upon 
us,
That we might be called the Sons 
of God!
Wherever He bids us we will go,
Wherever He leads we will  follow,
'Cause who the Son has set free is 
free indeed."
1028;WE ARE HERE TO PRAISE;C;"We are here to praise You,
To lift our hands and sing.
We are here to give You,
The best that we can bring;
Bringing You our love,
Rising from our hearts,
Everything within us cries,
""I love You Lord."""
1029;VICTORY AND GLORY;C;"I have heard but now I see,
God's promise to you and me.
All these years through thick and 
thin,
We have laboured to enter in.
Then God's silence was broken 
through and I can see me and 
you

CHORUS
Singing Victory,
Victory and Glory for all eternity,
It's the promise of God to us.
Victory and Glory, for all eternity, 
Hallelujah!
Victory and Glory, for all eternity,
We'll sing it forever,
Victory and glory for all eternity.

The Thunders came, the Seals 
revealed,
Couldn't understand all, but yet 
we believed.
Many thought we were off on a 
limb;
But they didn't know we were 
worshipping Him.
Wednesday the third of June at 
Cocoyea God decided to display 
Himself.

Now we are climbing higher each 
day,
Conquering all devils who stand 
in our way,
This Bride is ready to make her 
stand
For the kingdom of God is at 
hand,
For it becometh unto us to 
fulfill all righteousness.

This Bride's revival is here to 
stay,
We must press harder to keep it 
that way.
Through prayer, obedience and 
sincerity,
We'll all inherit eternity;
JVHU, I Jesus, is here to prove
that this Bride won't fail"
1030;OUR RESTORED FAITH;G;"This Message bought us back to 
oneness with our God,
With Seven Seals opening up 
His Holy Word.
Seven Mysteries thundering out 
and unfolding;
Rapturing Faith for Rapturing 
Grace now revealing.
CHORUS
The Adoption, full Redemption,
All authority and power
Is restored unto the Bride in this 
great hour.
I was troubled and confused in 
Laodicea,
No satisfaction for this deep and 
inward hunger,
Clouds of darkness hovered o'er 
me trying to blind me,
The Light broke through, the 
shadows flew, and now I can 
see.

I have heard about the inspired 
declaration,
Made by ambassadors for Christ 
from South in Trinidad,
The move is on for the chosen 
ones by election;
The local Bride is gathering in for 
the adoption.

Seven Voices thundered out in 
this hour, 
Revealing Faith to Brotherly 
Kindness for the Rapture,
Anointing hearts and lives with 
overcoming power;
Fear and bondage, skepticism 
could not linger.

We are quickened by this 
blessed revelation,
Changing from glory unto glory 
for Redemption,
Perfect Love uniting hearts for 
translation,
Perfect Faith conquering death 
for resurrection."
1031;LET GOD HOLD YOUR HAND;C;"When you feel that your life is 
almost gone,
And the burdens they are just too 
much to bear,
When you think that my God has left
you in your most trying hour,
Just remember He'll be there to 
hold your hand.

CHORUS
So just let God hold your hand,
He never failed and He will not fail,
He'll always be there,
So when you think that you're so 
alone,
My Jesus, He will help you stand,
So just let go and let God hold 
your hand.

Every word that He has promised 
is true,
He has kept me only by His saving 
grace,
So when the pressures of this world 
engulf you like a mighty sea,
He'll be there, He will be there to 
hold your hand.

Take my hand precious Lord, lead 
me home."
1032;JESUS NAME;C;"Jesus, name above all names,
Wonderful Saviour,
Glorious Lord,
Immanuel, God is with us,
Blessed Redeemer, Living Word."
1033;IMMANUEL IMMANUEL;C;"Immanuel, Immanuel
His name is called Immanuel,
He's God with us,
Revealed in us,
His name is called Immanuel."
1034;MY LORD DELIVERED ME;D;"There was a time  when 
I was deep in sin,
No place in my heart 
For the Lord to enter in;
Stumbling in darkness,
The way I could not find,
There was a deep in my soul, 
I knew I was blind,
Until His light did shine.

CHORUS
My Lord delivered me with His 
mighty hand,
My Lord delivered me from the 
sinking sand.
My Lord delivered me, that is 
why I sing,
My Lord delivered me, I could 
never stop praising Him.

Now I am a warrior with a battle 
to fight,
I'm not afraid for the Lord my 
Captain is in sight,
He'll point the Silver Sword and 
I'll obey His Word,
But the foolish man, he can't 
understand,
I'm His thought made flesh by 
predestination.

So here we are so great with 
child,
Resting on that Seventh Peak, 
Waiting orders from on high
To exercise the Third Pull, 
our inheritance;
But the wicked man cannot 
understand,
There cannot be any 
impersonation.

Love one another my brothers, 
Let's run this race,
Endure to the end, 
For we know we'll see His face.
Grow in grace my sisters, 
Let's fulfill all righteousness,
For we are flesh of His flesh and 
bone of His bone
We'll sit with Him in His throne."
1035;HOLDING MY PALM;G;"When I see all Israel in their homeland,
When I see all prodigals come home;
Then, this evil world,
Clothed with darkness in their  soul,
Very soon to hear from our Redeemer;
The Word-Bride, we are sealed and 
ready,
For the holy new Jerusalem;
I am rejoicing and singing,  Shalom!
Holding my palm in my hand.

CHORUS
Yes, I am holding my palm in my 
hand,} 2x
Where the eagles are gathered
Worshipping the Lamb,
I am holding my palm in my hand.

I'm not boasting about much revelation,
I'm not boasting about much inspiration;
But when I look in 
And miss Elijah from the scene;
I believe and fear, for I know who is 
here;
About two hundred pounds 
Of olive skinned complexion,
Pouring out His fullness unto man;
Like John, I shout, Hallelujah!
Holding my palm in my hand.

And when I hear God's Holy Word 
revealing,
All the mysteries of Christ the Son of 
Man;
I recognize my day and what the Spirit 
says,
""Come out of Laodicea;""
For the white horse rider will take the 
hindmost,
So come into the Royal Holy Ghost;
And the Spirit and the Bride say, 
""Come, come, come,""
Holding my palm in my hand.

And when I feel that hot Shekinah glory,
Drawing me deeper into love's veil;
And I feel those flames of light
Changing my robes to white,
To a place where I could never fail;
For it was by predestination,
He came to dwell in me, His chosen 
one;
Then let the winds, and the waves, and 
Satan storm,
I am holding my palm in my hand.

Now when I see us gathered in Abel 
country
Reviewing forty years of history
And we see how we have come
All the battles that we have won
We are God's mighty marching army
Seven compound redemptive names of 
our great Jehovah
He has been revealing unto us
We are led by the Dove onto perfect 
love
And we are holding our palms in our 
hands"
1036;WE ARE YOUR PEOPLE;G;"Oh Lord, we are Your people
Chosen by Your grace;
You took us from the heathen
To be a super race;
And as children of the great King 
of Kings 
We have all reason to shout and 
sing;
You've given us joy, joy, joy.}2x

If You should mark iniquity,
Which of us could stand?
How could we get through this life
Without Your guiding hand?
So Lord, we ask You, forgive our 
failures
And deliver us from all temptation;
And make us strong, strong, 
strong.}2x

We know we're not deserving
Of all Your graciousness;
We know we fail You daily
And sometimes misbehave,
But Lord, we love You, we want to 
serve You,
Yes Lord, we need You and we 
believe You
Will help us overcome.}2x

Oh yes, You have redeemed us
By Your precious blood;
Your power brought deliverance
When Satan came in like a flood;
And Lord we see You strong in 
battle,
Yes Lord, we see You breaking 
the shackles
And giving us Joy, Joy, Joy.}2x"
1037;MORE THAN CONQUERORS;D;"The hour of shaking is now at 
hand
When many builders would 
realize
They have built on sinking sand.
For the stone that the builders 
refused
They have rejected, the 
Revelation of the Son of Man.
But unto you He's been a 
treasure,
And an anchor to your soul,
All the evils of this world
We'll overcome.

CHORUS
For more than conquerors we are
Through the power of Jesus' Name 
Priests and Kings He has made us
And forever we shall reign

Many pressures came from 
outside and within,
And temptations did rise to take a 
look
Unto the other side;
But by the grace of God we 
resisted sin
And the devils were surprised,
We knew by the Word of the Lord
We were tested and tried;
But unto you who look above
Through the window of perfect love,
God has sent to us His sign
On the wings of a Dove.

Ministry becomes reality,
Now men will see with the eye
The works of God expressed 
through His little Bride,
Every knee must bow, every 
tongue confess,
Men's folly be made manifest,
The foolish man won't be able to 
stand;
But unto the wise who 
understands
Great exploits are now at hand,
For Michael's feet are on the sea 
and on the land."
1038;LO! IN HER MOUTH E;E;"We can see the signs of the times 
are all around,
Unclean spirits like frogs coming out 
of the Dragon's mouth,
False prophets are lying and the 
truth they are denying;
But we have received our 
message of grace,
On the wings of a Snow-White 
dove.

CHORUS
Lo! in her mouth
Is an olive leaf,
That speaks about redemption,
That speaks about His grace.
Lo! in her mouth
Is an olive leaf;
It speaks about eternal life 
And fellowship with God.

Economic and social pressures are 
everywhere,
Many have been caught unawares;
The hour of temptation has come 
upon everyone,
But unto us His little Bride, His 
voice whispers 'Shalom!'

He said, ""Fear not my child, all 
your troubles are over,
Your enemy has been destroyed. 
Your great enemy has been 
conquered;""
Fear none of these things that 
shall tear this world apart,
For the Dove is cooing in our hearts
Who are shut up in the ark."
1039;HE RECONCILED ME;G;"He reconciled me from the pits of 
the miry clay,
He brought me in His arms to stay,
And I'll praise Him for that day.
He reconciled me from the pits of 
the miry clay,
Whenever Satan comes my way,
I'll remind Him of that day."
1040;GREATER WORKS;C;"CHORUS
Greater works than these shall you 
do, 
For it's a promise for me and you.
Greater works than these
shall you do,
For it's a promise for me
and you.

For we are partakers, Lord, of 
Your holiness,
And we are now clothed in  Your 
righteousness;
And we are Your children walking 
in this Evening Light,
And in Your Bride You'll be 
glorified.
For the God of Peace shall bruise 
Satan  under our feet,
The army of the living God, he 
shall not defeat;
So let us praise God for this 
mighty privilege
To be a part of this apostolic 
heritage.

For the cup of the iniquity of this 
world is almost full,
And here we are upon Mt. Zion 
awaiting that final pull;
May God grant us the faith to  use 
that two-edged sword,
For every day Your elect cries, 
""Just once more Lord.""

So brothers and sisters let's  keep 
on abiding in His Word;
Don't look to the things of this 
world and get your vision blurred;
For we've been drawn to that holy 
place
Where Our Lord has placed His 
name; 
Having blessed assurance He'll 
glorify it again.

Greater works than these shall you 
do,
For it's a promise for me and you.
BRIDGE
Unconditional promise for me  and 
you,
Unfailing promise for me and  you,
Holy Ghost promise for me and 
you,
Seven Thunders promise for me 
and you,
Oh, what a mighty promise for me 
and you."
1041;VESSELS OF HONOUR;F;"We are troubled on every side
Yet not distressed,
Perplexed but not in despair;
Persecuted but not forsaken,
Even in trials we are not 
forgotten.
That's why in all these things,
We are more than conquerors
Pressing the upward way;
And we bear in our bodies
The dying of our Lord everyday, 
everyday.

CHORUS
'Cause we are vessels of honour   }
Set aside unto the Master's use,   }
And they whom He foreknew,            }
Them He did choose.  } 
2x

Our Lord was tempted on every 
side,
Yet without sin,
That we could reign with Him;
Proven to be the true Saviour,
Lord and King and Blessed 
Redeemer.
Now we are given a sacred trust
To fulfill His word
In this hour of destruction.
Surely goodness and mercy
Will be with us despite the 
condition."
1042;GOD'S ELECTIVE LOVE;Em;"Deep calleth unto deep ,
In the night time I scarcely sleep.
Why art thou disquieted in me 
my soul?

I've found hope in the Lord of 
glory;
He has revealed my life's 
mystery,
Shown me that I was in His 
thoughts from times of old.

CHORUS
It's the rising of the sun,
When the children of God on the 
earth are born;
This Evening Light from above,
It's nothing less than God's 
elective love.

I see Mary, she's walking slowly,
Along the narrow road that's 
dusty,
When the child is born your 
sorrow will be gone;
""Esther, Esther, touch that 
sceptre,
With the King you have found 
favour;""
Anything you do, do it in that 
name. 

Samson's locks are now a little 
longer,
Faith muscles are becoming 
stronger,
Between the pillars the Lord will 
strike His Masterpiece;
Now the Headstone is drawing 
nearer,
Dynamics are worked in greater 
measure;
Pulsations of faith will soon 
create: ""Let there be.""

Seven Thunders activating the 
countdown,
The North Star leads the battle 
stars to the showdown,
Two hundred million devils  will 
be on the run;
Joel's mighty army comes on 
display,
The elements will tremble  before 
them on that day,
For strong is the Lord that 
executeth His Word.

Our hearts are burning with 
expectation, 
For the promised eternal vacation,
Reservations have already been 
made;
Next attraction, coming soon,
Bridegroom and Bride leave for 
honeymoon,
On the wings of Love she'll take 
her flight thru' the skies."
1043;AFTER ALL;Bb;"Trials here are sometimes many,
And oft times my feet grow weary,
Till it seems I almost stumble 
and fall.
But the tender hand that leads me, 
Is the hand that keeps me steady;
Gives me faith, that I can make 
it, after all.

CHORUS
After all this life is over,
And our burdens have been lifted,
And we stand upon the mountain 
top so tall;
Looking over in that city,
That our Saviour is preparing,
Gives me faith, that I can make it, 
after all.

By myself I cannot make it,
But I know He's there to help me,
He will hear my cry, if only I will call.
""Just keep trusting, and believing,""
Are the words I hear Him whisper;
Just a few more days to labour 
after all."
1044;THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH;F;"The Lord is my strength and }
my song.    }2x
He has become my salvation, }2x
The Lord is my strength 
And my song."
1045;AS I POSSESS THIS LAND;A;"As I continue to possess this land,
Lord let me hold fast this revelation,
All along the way, Lord lead me 
all the time;
For You know this path real good,
It is a road You have already trod,
And you overcame every 
temptation by Your own Word.

CHORUS
Lord anoint me more and more,
With overcoming inspiration,
Seven powerful thundering voices
Shattering every strong temptation;
Perfect faith and confidence,
Lord my soul is longing for;
Perfect strength in perfect 
weakness, Lord allow.

Lord, I know that this land is mine,
For You have made me to 
understand
Your counsel is immutable, You 
cannot lie;
You have restored back all the 
Word,
And Your promises are assured;
Forward in faith to the objective as 
I journey along.

Alert and ever watchful, help me to 
be,
As I walk this land with Thee,
Ever spotless may this pure white 
raiment be;
I've surrendered whole- heartedly,
Looking for the change of immortality
And I remember how You came 
and delivered me.

You are the same Jesus that 
calmed the sea,
And You're dwelling now in me,
Make me conscious more and 
more of my ability;
Full obedience to Thy Word,
Because of love for what You did,
Exercising the faith of God  that's 
locked up in me."
1046;IN THE BEGINNING;Em;"CHORUS
In the beginning, before the 
beginning,
The great Elohim, had no origin,
He had no father, no mother, the 
great Jehovah our God.

He had in His mind before the 
foundation,
That He, the Lamb would be slain
To redeem His creation;
He knew we had fallen from our 
lofty heights to sin,
So He had to come in flesh and 
die,
To bring us back again to Eden.

He came with a Shout revealing 
His redemption,
To call and claim His Bride
From the powers of deception;
So why should we doubt
That His words are in our mouths,
For He has ordained that we must 
prophesy again,
To every nation.

We have crossed back the chasm 
to our lofty heights,
By seven thundering voices, His 
great evening light;
We'll be translated to His heavenly 
domain,
We'll sit with Him as priests and 
kings;
We will reign with Him
Forever and ever and ever."
1047;GOD CAN DO IT AGAIN;F;"God can do it again
And again and again;
There's no reason to doubt
God can do it again.
Yesterday and the day before,
He is always the same;
There's no reason to doubt
God can do it again."
1048;KICK HIM DOWN    C;C;"CHORUS
Kick him down, kick him down } 
Have the devil on the run;           }
A son of God must not be        }
trodden down,      }
So kick that  mamba down.                 }2x 

Arise and shine, King Theophany 
has come,
Let's hold to His unchanging hand.
Praise the Lord, praise His name 
and be garrisoned by prayer;
Don't let the devil shake your 
confidence
Or in your heart put fear.
Don't you hate your brother,  
That's the root of bitterness;
We've got to walk in that way 
of holiness, of holiness.

Cover your face, cover your feet
With reverence and humility,
Let's go into action with God-given 
ability.
Stand flatfooted in your trials,
Though they may be sometimes 
mean;
Always remember to call Jesus on 
the scene.
Remember everyday to have the 
token on display,
It's an act of love so follow that 
Dove,
That snow-white Dove, that snowwhite Dove.

Unconquered by tradition, in this 
day we stand,
Like Joshua and Caleb, we're 
going to take that land;
But brother it won't be easy, 
It's not a flowery bed of ease,
Remember that old devil, 
Will bring on that terrible squeeze;
Don't let him have you blue, 
Wondering what you're gonna do:
For we're on that Seventh Peak, 
So we'll just speak;
We'll just speak."
1049;DRY BONE IN THE VALLEY;Em;"I was a dry bone in the valley,
When Jesus found me;
A dry bone in the valley,
When He put flesh upon me.

CHORUS
Said, ""Son of Man, can these dry 
bones live?""
And I answered, ""Oh Lord, Thou 
knowest.""
You have given us prophetic 
eyes,
So we won't believe Satan's lies;
Although the world thinks us 
absurd,
We'll keep on holding to Your 
Word.

We are the flowers and You are 
life's essence,
May Oh Lord, You have the preeminence;
For that's the reason why You 
made us,
To achieve Your greatest 
purpose.

Now I stand justified and do 
appreciate
The out-pouring of Your wonderful 
grace;
Sanctified from the bondage of sin,
As the Holy Spirit now dwells  
within.

Now I'm no longer a dry bone in 
the valley, 
Since Jesus set me free;
And now I'm growing in His Grace,
And some day soon I'll see His 
face."
1050;LET THE BOOK LIVE;D;"Let the Book live in me dear Lord
Show me myself within Thy 
Word
Show me myself and show me 
my Saviour,
And let the Book live in me."
1051;I FEEL LIKE PRAISING HIM;D;"When I wake up in the morning
And think of the great things
God has done for me,
In my heart there's such rejoicing 
To think that a new day has 
dawned on me;
For the glorious mysteries in God's 
Word,
That He has allowed me to share:
It's only an indication of His great 
love, and how much He cares.

CHORUS
I feel like p-r-a-I-s-I-n-g Him  
P-r-a-I-s-e Him    
I feel like p-r-a-I-s-I-n-g Him  
P-r-a-I-s-e Him  

Like to Abraham, He came down
In this day unto me.
Showing me things that were and 
things that are, and things, things 
that are to be.
What has been hidden from the 
eyes of the wise and the prudent,
He has revealed unto His own;
A message of preparation, to take 
us to our eternal home.

When I think that I'm one in a million
Chosen by God to stand in this evil 
day,
It fills my heart with love for the 
Heavenly Dove who has led me
In God's provided way.
I, who was dead in sins and 
trespasses, so wretched, so 
wretched and so vile,
It took His Amazing Grace, to lift 
me to a place that He now calls me,
Calls me His Bride.

When I see all hell extending her 
borders to swallow up humanity, I 
thank the One with the keys of 
death and hell, 
Who has opened the prison door 
for me.
He has changed my course from 
the regions of the lost, that realm 
of insanity,
By anointing my eyes with a 
Heavenly vision 
To behold and live eternally."
1052;DOVE LEADING THE EAGLE;F;"I just want the Dove
To lead this eagle,
I just want the Dove 
To lead this eagle home;
For I know the Dove is here,
He has come to lead God's 
eagles;
And I know He will guide me,
And keep me in His Word.

I just want to follow
The way You will lead me,
I just want to follow
The way that You will go;
For I know You will lead me
In the footprints that You have 
left,
And I know that You will guide 
 me
And keep me in this path.

I just love that Dove,
For He is my Lord,
I just love that Dove,
For He has been my guide;
He has brought me up seven 
steps
To a perfect faith I've never 
known;
Now He'll send me with His 
Word
As He rides this trail again."
1053;LET'S TAKE TIME;D;"Let's take time to wait upon the 
Lord,
Let's take time to listen to His 
voice;
Unless the Lord builds the 
house,
We labour in vain,
Let's take time to wait upon the 
Lord."
1054;OVERCOMING POWER;G;"The Message came in this last age 
to prepare a Bride,
To walk with Him and talk with Him 
and in His Word abide.
It's written in the Spoken Word, 
and it's  laying there,
To bring us into Rapturing Grace 
and take us out of here.

CHORUS
Overcoming Power is what we 
have today,
Overcoming Power to keep the 
devil away;
Overcoming Power till we become 
the Word.
That's when we'll leave this sinful 
earth
And go and meet the Lord.

We have passed the seventh age, 
The power has to come.
The scientists have gone to work,
They're sure to get the job done.
Our sins and weights to lay aside, 
And we'll set everything right;
So when the inspiration falls we'll 
just take off in flight.

Our Moses has already gone, 
He has prepared the way,
He brought us to the Jordan, 
And he was taken away;
But Joshua is preparing now to 
sound out His command,
To gather all the saints of God to 
enter the Promise Land.

This day will I begin to magnify 
thee in the people's sight,
You and I were eye witnesses at 
Mc.Allister Street that night;
Also in the Hospital we had 
witnesses there;
By inspiration, ""In seven days time,
You'll be walking out of here.""

We've planted flags, we've placed 
our stones,
We had testimonies there,
They will serve as memorials to drive 
away all doubt and fears.
On June the 3rd that's when the 
Lord rolled our reproach away,
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, 
I, Jesus Christ, is here."
1055;BLESSED ARE YOU;Bb;"Like a hart pursued by his evil 
foe,
He knows well to stay near that 
brook
Where the living waters flow;
So panteth my soul after You, 
the living Word,
I know well to stay near that river
where living waters flow.

CHORUS
Blessed are you
Who hunger and thirst after 
righteousness,
Blessed are you
For you shall be filled;
Blessed are you
When men persecute you for My 
name's sake, you see;
Blessed are you, blessed are 
you, blessed are you.

Where there is a deep,
There is a deep to respond;
For unto this end were you born
To be a child of God,
A child of I AM,
Know that the great I AM now 
dwelleth in you,
And soon through you, He'll 
display
He's just as great today 
As He was yesterday.

In the midst of the night,
We saw an amber-coloured 
Light,
The Light of yellowish green
Is Jesus on the scene
Come to lead His elected genes;
Beyond the riven veil,
On peaceful waters the ship now 
sails,
No more tossed to and fro
By stormy winds that blow,
He has anchored our soul"
1056;ANGEL SWEPT BACK WINGS;C;"The Light has come to show 
where we are going,
In bridal step along the way we 
are treading.
The revealed Word has shown 
us our placing,
A Super-race we are in the 
perfect rest of God.

CHORUS
Oh, that Angel with the sweptback wings,
He's the One that means the 
most.
He took us in the Inner Veil,
To reveal Himself more privately.
Here we are in perfect step,
In the promises of God.
Oh that Angel with the swept 
back wings,
He's the One that means the 
most.

All honour and glory and praise to 
His Name,
For He was found worthy to take 
the Book,
And show us our names.
Flesh of His flesh and bone of His 
bone,
In harmony we stand,
In God's provided place,
In the Seventh Seal of God.

The Seven Spirits in Revelation,
Is that notable Angel,
Who brought back the keys
To open the Third Pull.
Came back shouting ""Grace, 
Grace, Grace!
For I, JESUS, am the Word of 
God,
That is in your midst right now."""
1057;CAN'T YOU SEE WHY;D;"Can't you see why I'm happy?
I've accepted the Word of the Lord.
The revealed Word that was 
spoken
By the prophet of Malachi: 4."
1058;THE CHALLENGE;G;"It's a challenge to accept,
It's a faith to rise into,
It's a way I can show the world
That Jesus Christ is true;
It's a life to live, a testimony 
blameless,
Living for Christ, standing every 
test.

CHORUS
For I've got to prove
I'm one in a million,
I've got to show the power of the 
blood;
I've got to prove I'm not like 
those
from Satan's Eden,
I've got to show that I'm a  person
that this world isn't worthy of.

True representative of Christ,
In the field that you've been 
placed,
The joy of your life with Him,
Always a glowing on your face;
Living humbly, following the ways 
He showed,
A true witness of Christ in this day.

Who are the ones that's going to 
stand,
And keep a testimony clean?
In the midst of an unbelieving  world,
We'll keep looking to the unseen;
To really know that we will 
overcome,
And receive His promise to sit on 
His throne."
1059;WE'RE TOGETHER AGAIN;G;"We're together again just praising 
the Lord.
We're together again in one 
accord.
Something good is going to 
happen,
Something good is in store.
We're together again, just praising 
the Lord."
1060;GOD'S CHURCH MARCHING;A;"God's church is led by the 
mighty arm
Of the Great Five Star General,
To execute His redemption plan,
And to wind up the commission.
She is marching now in view,
She is Michael's chosen few;
The Chief Captain with the  Silver 
Sword,
He's pointing her to victory 
ahead.

CHORUS
God's church is marching,
God's church is marching,
God's church is marching the 
victor's march;
God's church is marching, 
God's church is marching,
God's church is marching the 
victor's march.

God's church has moved into a 
sphere,
Where she can have what she 
desires,
For the anointing is released to 
her
To display authority and power.
To have the blind and deaf 
 restored, 
The sick and dead raised by the 
Word,
She's a mighty marching army,
She'll shake the world with her 
 ministry.

God's church is sounding the 
jubilee
And setting the captive free;
She's conquering the enemy
From victory unto victory;
She is strong and courageous
In the revival of the just,
She's made her final turn at the 
west,
And she is marching the victor's 
 march.

God's church is waving the 
banner high,
For her victory day is nigh;
She's in position on the Seventh 
Peak
For the super power now to 
 strike.
She'll be a witness to the total 
 lost
By manifesting the greater 
 works,
And the New Name that she 
bears with pride,
Once again, it will be glorified.

God's church is singing the 
victor's song,
As the battle rages on,
All things are under her dominion
She knows the battle is already 
won.
Soon she'll march to her home 
on high
For communion in the sky,
And those waiting mighty gentile
warriors;
Will rise and join in the victor's 
march."
1061;QUICKENED, CHANGED;D;"Oh, I'm quickened, changed, 
translated
By the power of the Holy Ghost,
And I'm waiting for the outward
To be changed and taken off the 
earth.
His power now is moving,
It's deep inside of me,
When I look into the mirror,
I know it's Him I see."
1062;ABRAHAM'S BLESSING;F;"Abraham's blessings }
are mine;        }4x
I'm blessed coming in,  }
I'm blessed going out,   }3x
Abraham's blessings are mine."
1063;THE DEED THAT CAME;D;"This is what we have been taught
By the prophet of God today.
All the things that Adam lost
Now are available unto us.
He identified the Cloud that came,
As the Deed to man again,
The Deed that came.

CHORUS
This is what it's all about,
Let us lift our voices together and 
shout,
Hallelujah! to our God 
Who has redeemed us by His 
blood,
The Deed that came.

This great mystery that was sealed
In our day has been made so real.
'Twas the abstract title deed,
The promise God made to 
Abraham's seed.
Seven deaths and seven steps,
That the Christ may be formed in 
me,
The Deed that came.

This dominion that Adam lost,
In our day has been displayed;
By a simple, humble man;
One who stood true to God's great 
plan.
And from flesh to Word he came,
Spoke a word and squirrels came,
The Deed that came."
1064;SINGING I LOVE YOU LORD;C;"In moments like these, 
I sing out a song,
I sing out a love song to Jesus;

In moments like these I lift up my 
hands,
I lift up my hands to you Lord.

Singing, I love You Lord, 
Singing, I love You Lord,
Singing, I love You Lord,
I Love You Lord.
Singing, I'll serve You Lord 
Singing, I'll praise You Lord"
1065;THE ORIGINAL LIFE;A;"God's attributes were manifested 
to His Bride in this last day,
We have caught the revelation by 
the last prophet's message;
And we know who we are and 
what we are raised up for,
Praise the Lord for the Original Life.

CHORUS
The Original Life, the Original Seed,
The Original Word is what I believe,
The Son of Man is revealed;
The Seventh Seal is unveiled,
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

Our eyes of understanding, He has 
opened up at last,
And sweet victory is ours who were 
chained down in the past;
True Jubilee has sounded and we 
have responded to our God,
Who's the Original Life.

We are the word made flesh today 
This is what the scripture say
And our names are seen within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin;
Yes we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who's the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption, full 
authority and power,
Sleeping saints will wake and 
join us for translation in this hour;
Gentiles' days soon be over,
Glory, Hallelujah!
To our God, who's the Original 
Life."
1066;IT'S ALL RIGHT;F;"Church it's all right, (Yes, it's all right) 
Church it's all right,  (Yes, it's all right) 
As long as I have my God beside me, 
It's all right,
As long as I have His hand to hold,
As long as He watches over my soul,
As long as I'm under His control,
Then it's all right."
1067;ARISE AND BE DOING;Em;"Oh, prisoners of Love, the Master 
have need of thee.
Who shall build the Lord's house, 
A magnificent sanctuary?
But a people He has chosen to bear 
His name,
Yesterday, today and forever,
His awesome power remains the 
same.

CHORUS
Arise, and be doing and the Lord be 
with thee,
Who shall build the Lord's house, 
A magnificent sanctuary?
Arise, and be doing and the Lord be 
with thee,
We shall build the Lord's house,
A magnificent sanctuary.

""Come forth My sons with wisdom 
and skill,
My anointing is on thee,
Who shall lay any hindrance when 
I've ordained the victory?
Take your hammer and My sword,
Be thou courageous and strong.
Only believe My Word and a 
paradox I will perform.""

""Take My yoke, My love slave,
For it's easy and My burden's light,""
Who shall serve the Lord thy God,
With all his soul and strength and 
might?
But His people He has taken from 
the depths of the miry clay,
Let every lively stone in His 
building find its perfect place."
1068;GOD CAN DO ANYTHING;F;"God can do anything, anything, 
anything,
God can do anything for you.
He's the Alpha, the Omega,
The beginning and the end.
God can do anything for you."
1069;CHRIST REVEALED;F;"The promise of the Lord is now at 
hand,
And in the love of God, O there 
she stands;
That Super-race the Lord has 
spoken to, 
""Thus saith the Lord, she's in plain 
view.""

Our beloved prophet cried to see 
our day,
When the beloved Bride of God 
will show the way,
Today, here stands the Bride 
becoming Christ;
Passing every Bridal test into 
perfect rest.

Elisha surely saw Elijah go,
And he got a double part of grace 
to know;
So nothing will stand in God's 
Bride's way,
For she saw Elijah go along the 
way.

The mystery is God in our flesh,
And veiled behind our skins, that is 
the test;
Stumbling the world with its 
simpleness,
For we now see that we are the 
Messiahettes.

The enemy is running on every 
hand,
All heaven is amazed, God's 
mystery grand;
Those seven thunders saying 
""Christ is  revealed,""
Now Jesus Christ and Bride united 
stand."
1070;I LOVE MY JESUS;F;"I love my Jesus      }
And Jesus loves me       }
In Him, I am so happy.      }2x

In Him I am so happy.   }2x"
1071;THESE DIVINE TRUTHS;D;"Oh precious Lord, how we thank 
Thee
For revealing to us Thy perfect 
will,
So that we could receive the faith 
of God.
Without a shadow of a doubt,
We know that the faith of our 
fathers is living still,
For by infallible proofs,
You have displayed that faith 
through us.

CHORUS
These divinely revealed mystery }
truths           }
Have restored back the faith.   } 2x
You have made us in Your image
To reflect who You are.

These divinely revealed mystery

Oh loving Lord You have made us 
a promise
To fill us with Your love,
So that we can be united with the 
Head-stone.

How we thank Thee
For these Seven Thundering Voices,
And for revealing to us,
That we are the manifested sons!
Oh adoring Bridegroom, we've 
recognized You
As our Headship and Loving Lord,
The Revealed Word that has been 
rejected.

How we thank Thee
That we could lift our hearts in 
praises; 
And for revealing to us, 
We are Abraham's faith seed!"

1073;TIRED TRAMPING;F;"There's a deep and inward hunger
Within my soul.
God has promised in His Word,
He'll make us whole.
Well it's time for it to happen,
That huge portion of heaven;
It will make and bring to pass,
That tremendous victory in the 
love divine.

CHORUS
For I'm tired of tramping on this 
mountain,
I'm heading down to the Jordan,
Lo, before me I see a vision 
breaking,
A Power that would bind that 
mamba,
The third pull ministry.

Now's my time for consecration,
I must see a change in me,
I will enter my secret closet,
And close the door behind me.
I'll keep the feast of Unleavened 
Bread
With truth and sincerity,
For I'm expecting Jehovah-Jireh,
My Lord, to meet with me.

Lord, keep Thy Holy fire burning
Deep in my soul,
Change me from glory unto glory,
Till Thy image You behold.
Let's keep this Holy convocation,
Till we become a new creation,
For it's the message in you and me
Will bring to pass that tremendous 
victory."
1074;ACROSS THE BRIDGE D;D;"Across the bridge,
There'll be no sorrow,
Across the bridge,
There'll be no pain;
The Son will shine
Across the river,
And we'll never be unhappy again."
1075;SHALOM;C;"Oh Lord my God, Thy Word is a 
Lamp unto my feet,
Showing us the way, how we  must 
strive along;
The Seventh Seal has brought an 
open vision unto us,
Revealing Christ, the Way, the 
Truth, the Door.

CHORUS
Then He says, ""Peace, Peace,
Peace unto My lovely Bride,
Shalom, Shalom!"" for a new day 
has been broken;
From this sick and dying world
To God's life and immortality,
All we can hear from His Throne 
Is ""Good Morning! Good Morning! 
To my Bride.""

The dawning of a new day we can 
feel over us now,
Seven steps He showed to God's 
provided place;
King Theophany Jesus is here 
amongst us now,
To show His bride how  Rapturing 
Grace will be.

Face to face we see now, no more 
darkly in a mirror,
Anointed and commissioned to do 
His perfect will;
Hear the Voice now calling, crying, 
""Peace, Peace, Peace;""
Enter in now before the doors  are 
closed."
1076;SOMETHING MORE;D;"Something more than my 
yesterday,
More than I had before;
Something more than wealth or 
fame,
He gave me something worth 
living for."
1077;SPECIAL MOUNTAIN;C;"I long to see Jesus,
Just a glimpse of Him cannot satisfy.
I just want to love Him,
Till all the fears in me completely 
subside.

For there's just something special 
about that mountain,
Though many valleys to cross
He's more than worth the pain,
There's just something special 
about that mountain,
I'm just ready to fight
One more time again.

I long for deeper fellowship
With the One who has chosen me 
to bear His name.

Just to love and serve Him again 
and again.

I long for the fullness of Eternal Life
To share a glory that will never fade 
away;
And I long for my precious new
body
Where no sickness or pain would 
ever be again.

I long for full dominion,
It's my inheritance, a son of God I 
am;
I long to go back to Eden,
It's my future home where I'll 
always be.

CHORUS
For there's just something special 
about that mountain,
Though many valleys to cross
He's more than worth the pain.
There's just something special

1079;THERE IS NOTHING;E;"There is no river, He cannot cross;
There is no mountain that's too tall,
That He cannot move;
There is no sickness, He cannot 
heal;
There is nothing, no nothing,
He cannot do for me.
There is no valley, that is too deep;
There is no chain that's too strong,
That I cannot be free;
There is no storm He cannot calm;
There is nothing, no nothing,
He cannot do for me."
1080;HE IS MORE THAN ABLE;C;"He is able, more than able,
To accomplish what concerns me 
today.
He is able, more than able

As we act on the things
That we have seen and we have 
heard.

CHORUS
How else can we live, forever 
praising Him, 
For we are living epistles read  of 
all men;
You are Almighty God in flesh 
again,
That's who we are,
Living epistles read of all men,
You are to me,
Almighty God in flesh again.
We've been made a spectacle to 
this world today,
The Life of Jesus being on  display;
Our resurrected Christ. 

Awaken Jesus to the scene again,
As He glorifies His Name once 
again in His children.
Let's press on daily with the King's 
Sword in our hand,
Defeating the enemy on every 
hand;
So ride on Thy Majesty to Thy 
rightful place
On the throne of our hearts;
Of this kingdom, He rose us up to 
be a part.

We know that today the Word is in 
the Bride
It's Jesus again on His second ride;
Let's bring our King, our rejected 
King,
A clean fresh drink,
By living worthy of this gospel 
We worship Him."
1082;LET US DRAW NEAR;G;"Are we weak and troubled or in 
deep despair?
Is the avenger of the soul on our 
trail?
Well, the Name of our Lord is a 
Mighty tower
That the righteous can run into and 
be safe.

CHORUS
Let us draw near with a true heart
In full assurance of faith;
That we find grace and  strength to 
help In time of need.

It took a perfect sacrifice before
We could ever attain to  perfect 
faith;
That's why Christ the perfect Lamb,
The atonement came,
And to the Holiest of Holies,
He cleared the way.

CHORUS
So let us draw near having our 
hearts
Sprinkled by His blood,
For now we have free access
To the throne of God.

We were not made angels, we're 
of mortal kind,
And we daily make mistakes for 
we are weak,
But we have not a High Priest  who 
cannot be touched
With the feelings of our infirmities."
1083;I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO;C;"I don't know what I'd do, 
I don't know what I'd do, 
I don't know what I'd do without 
the Lord;
When I look around and see,
All that He has done for me,
I don't know what I'd do without 
the Lord."
1084;THE NIGHT VISION;Am;"I beheld in the night vision,
O'er the great sea of humanity,
Creeping things, detestable 
things
Rising and gathering around me
From my soul came a desperate 
cry,
'Lord hide me from this hell I see,
I want to live with You eternally!'

CHORUS
I cried, ""Hide me Rock of ages,
Separate me from the evils of  this 
life,
Cover me with Thy robe of  purity,
Be Lord of my life.""
Then I lifted my eyes towards 
Heaven,
Lo, a Mighty Angel came down;
One foot on land and one upon sea,
And His face shone like the sun;
When He spoke His voice was like 
thunder,
And a mystery was made clear;
For the Voice that thundered 
judgement
Whispered freedom in my ear.

I considered the voice of the Angel,
Whose sayings were faithful and 
true,
Saying, ""I Jesus is the Word of God
That has come to redeem you;
Through the Angel in the pulpit,
Cause this man to understand
He would live and reign eternally.""

CHORUS
I cried, ""Thank Thee, Rock of ages,
You've separated me from the 
evils of this life,
You have covered me with Thy 
robe of purity,
You are Lord of my life.""

I was lifted amidst a great multitude
In the air above the sea,
A new song they sang no man 
could learn,
Shouting praise for victory;
Saying, ""Worthy is the Lamb,
Who has given us power to 
overcome,
We now live and we'll reign 
eternally.""

I heard a great voice saying, 
""Come up hither,
To the great supper of the Lamb
Prepared by God for those whom 
He foreknew
Before the world began,
Saying, ""Enter the joys of the Lord
My beloved Bride,
Come sit with Me, 
I just want you at My side."""
1085;FILL ME;F;"Dear Lord, I know You called me,
And I'm baptized in Your Name;
Yet there is this promise You have 
made,
So Lord, I am asking you
To fulfill Your Word that You would 
fill me with the Holy Ghost.

CHORUS
I'm asking You to fill me with the 
Holy Spirit,
Fill me, fill me with Your love;
So Lord, it would not just be a part,
But a circumcision of my whole 
heart,
There'll be no difference in  my 
standing and my state;
I'm asking You to fill me.

For me to live this Christian life
This old man must die
For Your Spirit to abide;
Lord, I don't want reformation,
But a Holy Ghost transfusion,
For You have said that I must be 
born again.

Lord, I see the challenge is rising,
And so many amongst us are  falling,
Shows me Lord, I need  another 
touch,
If You should come and live in me
I'll be having constant victory
By the faith that overcomes the 
world."

Shout, ""the Sword of the Lord and 
of Gideon!""
Yes, the Spirit of Gideon is on  me,
Yes, the Spirit of the Lord is 
anointing me.

Dig deeper in those mysteries, 
Let your seven locks grow long;
Oh anointing of Samson, 
Let faith  muscles become strong;
Lord, lead me to those pillars, 
Let me cast those devils down,
Let me hear those Seven Thunders 
sound;
For the Spirit of Samson is on  me,
Yes, the Spirit of the Lord is 
anointing me.

Touch the scepter in my hand;
Make known your desires 
It's my pleasure to command.""

They must have their liberty;
Let me go and set the captive  free.""

There's virtue in that sound. 
Arise and eat, be strengthened,
For this journey you must be  strong,
You were born to set your eyes on 
the Sun.

1087;CONSIDER HIM;F;"I have to sing to you
About the One who died for me,
Even though I've failed,
Yet His Love's still being 
expressed to me;
In my time of trial and when the 
enemy assails,
I draw back just for a little while
To consider Him.

CHORUS
Consider Him who for the joy 
endured the cross,
Consider Him who died for all  that 
was lost;
Consider Him who there on 
Calvary bore your pain,
I want you just for a little while
To consider Him.

I know that life is rough, 
sometimes the trials hard to bear,
And your daily life is encumbered 
with a load of care;
Then there are those times when 
you can't seem to bear the strain,
I want you just for a little while
To consider Him."
1088;SPEAK AND DON'T DOUBT;F;"Speak and don't doubt, 
Just believe in your heart,
Speak and don't doubt, 
Till His Word comes to pass,
Whatever thing you desire in your 
soul,
You just believe that my Lord, He will 
perform.

CHORUS
Joshua spake to the sun, 
And he said, ""sun stand still.""
It's all because he knew who he 
was,
Bride let us speak His Word
Having known who we are;
Revelation 10: 8-11: that's who we 
are.

We have arrived at that junction in 
His Word,
We have arrived where something 
must give way;
The faith of God that is locked up in 
our hearts,
We'll speak this very Word; 
We'll see His glory pass.

Our prophet spoke and he believed 
the Word,
Our prophet spoke and squirrels did 
appear;
God's redeemed Church has
reached up to that sphere,
Inside that little room where the 
power cannot fail.

Enter in there where the Light went 
in that room,
Enter in there where the Angel said 
He'll meet you;
You'll come out whole, with your 
crutches in your hand,
Leaping and praising God for there's 
power in that room."
1089;LET ME BE A SACRIFICE;F;"Let me be a sacrifice, holy and 
acceptable,
Let me be a sacrifice, consumed in Your 
praise,
Let me be a sacrifice, holy and 
acceptable,
Let me be a sacrifice, worshipping Your 
Name."
1090;THAT'S WHY I CALL HIM;G;"I was taken from His side
When my Lord bled and died,
The earth shook, and all of nature's 
pillars cried.
On that sad and mournful day,
The sun went down and hid away,
When by blood, Jehovah-God 
purchased His Bride.

CHORUS
That's why I call Him Lord, 
Lord Jesus Christ,
Yes, I call Him Lord Jesus Christ.
I'm a new creation,
I'm His flesh, I'm His spirit, I'm His 
bones,
And I'll tell the world He's Lord,
And we two are one.

Several times I've let Him down,
But my slide made His love more 
strong,
From His side flowed reconciling love,
Such a Love the world don't know;
Such a Love it could never show;
It took the Dove to bring it down from 
up above.

For a sign, just to show the world
That my Gene was celestial,
From His side royal blood did flow
Oh, the serpent's head was crushed 
well done,
Hallelujah to God's Holy One!
Who by His blood has brought me 
back to my God.

In this time of the catching away, 
Down here in this world His Bride 
won't stay
She'll be taken up and all the 
sleeping saints will wake
But before her change 
She'll have perfect faith and the 
Third Pull will be displayed
To show this world God's promise is 
sure, He cannot fail"

In the fulfillment of His Word.

the west,
Coming from the north and from the 
south;

For adoption on the summit of the 
Seventh Peak.

Summit on the Summit of the 
Seventh Peak)

We are on Mount Zion, in the secret 
place,
By the Sovereign Grace of our Lord;
A City on a Hill whose glory can't be 
hid,
We'll manifest the great and final 
 pull.

A Rainbow-covenanted One, 
In the Joshua Commission
Testifies ""She has turned at the 
west,""
With the authority for her ministry,
And she shall speak from the 
Summit of the Seventh Peak.

We sing a brand new song,
We are the blood-washed throng,
We've seen our names beneath the 
Seventh Seal.
He opened up to us all the mysteries,
And there's light now on the Summit 
of the Seventh Peak.

All things are ready now 
Father let the fire fall
Father glorify thy name, 
You did it once before 
In the life of Malachi 4
Now Father glorify your name"

1096;THE  HONEST IN HEART;G;"The first pull contacted the flesh  of 
man,

Who'll lay down their lives,
Willingly sacrifice;
He's going back for the honest in 
heart,
Going back for the honest in heart.
By faith, Rahab the harlot
Perished not with all the rest;
For she received the spies with 
peace,
And she was blessed;
The token was applied and even    }
though the walls fell down,      }
The spies went back for her,     }
(She was saved)     }
For she was honest in her heart.           }

On His way to Jerusalem 
He picked up the ones and twos;
Blind man, Bartimaeus,
And little Zacchaeus too;

In His Bride as she moves on,  }
He's seeking out all the      }

Our Lord, so rich in mercy,

Love burned deep within His  heart,

gone,
This Word has swept the face of 
the whole earth,
And there are many who have 
heard it;
But out of these there shines a 
Bride,
The chosen ones, the precious 
Seed of God,
She's the Rebecca for her Isaac;
And one of these days she will be 
changed,
She'll slip from time into eternity.

While people laugh at us and 
 mock,
Our lives are being raptured up 
with Him,
We know He has received us;
And we'll come forth in His image,
The chosen ones, the elected 
Seed of God,
The ones who love and serve Him;
And one of these days we will be 
changed,
We'll slip from time into eternity.

He will return just as He said,
To take His Bride away to be with 
Him,
In His great Millennium;
His promise is true; He has 
returned,
He never breaks or fails to keep 
His Word;
Just let us all be ready,
For one of these days we'll all be 
changed,
We'll slip from time into  eternity."

And prove we're worthy of the 
Cross.

We belong to a body, to a unit 
so unique,
Every member is important,
From the head down to the feet.
Everyone is affected
When one goes out of place,
So let's take our places faithfully,
Let's strive to keep the faith.

We've got to recognize
The deposit of the Word,
That God has placed within us
To face this evil world;
The skills that we've been blessed 
with,
And the natural ability,
Are like seeds and when planted
Will bring forth abundantly.

Through Jesus Christ;

1100;SECOND CYCLE;F;"Love went to the little fish
And gave it back its life;
Also went to Sis. Hattie Wright;
Salvation to her two boys.
It was Love that calmed the raging

Turned back the wild hornets;
It was Love in the prophet,
The first wave-sheaf offering.
	
CHORUS
It is Love, Love, Love, here today,
It is Love, Love, Love, here to stay,
He  has caused our blind eyes to 
see,
Given us faith and inward beauty,
Love in His Bride riding this trail 
again.
Remember He cannot lie
And His Words are not in vain.

He promised through the prophet,
""I'll ride this trail again.""
Many, many years have come and
gone,
Saints, what are we waiting on?
The truth's made plain, He's here,
Riding this trail again.
He went to Sis. Merle and stopped 
the issue of blood;
In San Fernando Hospital there He 
spoke the Word.

Caused Bro. Williams to make a 
stand
Against the words of the physician,
Healed Bro. Wayne and his boy;
Yes, He's here riding this trail again.
He went to Mon Repos,
And set the captive free,
Through our precious brothers,
He delivered her.

Saints there are many, many, 
more to say.
But the time is slipping away.
He's the former and the latter rain,
Yes, He's here riding this trail again."

But tell me of a new  civilization,
Oh, tell me of my journey back to 
Eden;
Oh, tell me of Boaz and 
redemption,
Oh, tell me of a virtuous woman,
God's Bride.

Like a woman in travail,
The earth groans under iniquity;
Science has ravished her virtues
To produce lying vanities,
Her birth pains are increasing,
The signs are clear to see;
Earthquakes in divers places,
Volcanoes erupting suddenly.

Oh, tell me of a glorious 
resurrection,
Oh, tell me the desert shall bloom 
like a rose;
Oh, tell me of the wonderful 
Millennium,
Oh tell me of glorious Mt. Zion,
My future home.

Like a woman that's perverted,
Sin has stripped her of her hair;
Man has cut down all her forests;
She's almost naked everywhere;
She's polluted in her rivers,
The land, the air and sea;
She must burn with the holy fire of 
God
To restore her purity.

But tell me what's under those 
Seven Trumpets,
Oh, tell me of God's three-fold 
mystery;
Oh, tell me of the greatest love 
story,
Oh, tell me about of a Man called 
Jesus,
Who died for me.

Oh, tell me, where will I go when 
the fire starts burning?
Oh, tell me about my Theophany;
Oh, tell me of the great Wedding 
Supper,
Oh, tell me of my Lord, who's yet a 
little higher, 
My eyes shall see.

Oh, tell me what's under those 
Seven Trumpets,
Oh, tell me that the cycle has 
returned;
Oh, tell me why it had to be little 
Shepherds,
Oh, tell me of the Inside Life with 
Jesus
Who died for me. 

Oh, tell me that my troubles are all 
gone,
Oh, tell me that it's only six inches 
long;
Oh, tell me of the Catalina 
Mountains,

descended,
To lead me home."

Brought this world in so much  sin;
Praise God your power has been 
broken,
When our Lord, our mighty 
conqueror entered in,
Freed us from sin;
Now I look unto redemption,
The abstract title deed has come;
Showing me that way unto

I'll sit with my Father in His  throne
I'll reign with Him one thousand

Where there's no sickness, or

Only joy, no more fears, no more

You were the one upon those 
horses;
White and red, black and pale,
Praise God your power has been 
broken,
Since those Seven Seals have 
been unveiled, 
You have failed;
Now I look unto redemption,
The abstract title deed has come
Showing me that way unto

And He will make us strong.

Though He hath broken,
Yet He will bind.

He is the Amber Light, the Pillar of 
Cloud,
Came down on the wings of a 
snow-white Dove;
He's Jesus, The Lord of Lords.

He came back in this day
In the  ringed-cloud mystery,
It was seen up in the skies,
And baffled the worldwide;
But to His little Bride He said: 
""It's I, you need not fear,
Just go back to the east
And I will meet you over there;""
He is The Angel of God with the 
silver-sword,
The One that meant the most  with 
the swept-back wings;
He's Jesus the King of Kings.

He was seen in Revelation, 
The Book of great symbols;
As The mighty Angel that came 
down,
Was clothed in a cloud;
But, do you know He has promised
All the mysteries would be  revealed?
The dying Lamb of Calvary was 
the One that broke those Seals;
He is the Lion that prevailed, 
The Lamb that was slain to take the 
book from the hand  of God;
He's Jesus called The Word of God.

Who is this Melchisedec who's 
always changing form, 
This mysterious One of the Bible
is hid to us no more;
His name is called the Word of God,
His vesture's dipped in blood;
He raised us as His standard
When the enemy comes like a flood;
He is the Supreme Judge, the 
Angel of God,
The Man that stepped out of the

The Amber Light, the Great I AM,
The God that came walking in the 
days of Sodom;

Dove.

Seeing Lord, You've given me a

A fountain shall be opened up,
And you shall be wholly clean.

are saved
And that all your sins are washed

A peace that cannot easily be

For it's good to know you're 
justified,
Your sins are under the blood;
It's good to know you cannot be 
lost
Under no circumstance,
But when the perils of this life
Befall you everyday;
There's peace with God, 
But most of all you need
The peace of God.

The Father comes and shows you 
your standing,
And that all you have ever done 
wrong 
He doesn't remember;
But to face your everyday trials 
you need something
That will give you settled peace
And cause worrying to cease.

The Father comes and shows you 
your standing
And that your sins were placed in the 
sea of His forgetfulness;
But sight and time being your 
worst enemies,
Breed fear and sometimes 
insecurity."

Every day is not the same.
If you know the Lord is leading you,
What you gonna worry about?"
1116;REDEMPTION BY BLOOD;F;"I felt death's sting, I had sensed its 
snares,
Its cruel pain brought bitter tears;
How could I escape when 
judgement was sure?
Who could plead my cause?
And when God saw there was no one
He sent to die His only Son,
For only through blood His wrath 
could have been appeased.
His justice was satisfied when 
blood flowed from Calvary.

CHORUS
Redemption by blood,
Oh wretched man that I am,
Who shall deliver me 
From the body of this death,
And who should set me free,
taking me out of this desert?
But I thank God through Jesus Christ,
And His death on Calvary,
It brought for me redemption by 
blood.

I felt the chains bind my soul within,
Serving that slave master sin
By reason of my bondage I sighed
And God heard my cry,
Remembering His covenant
A prophet He did truly send
With the Word of truth
To break the strongholds within,
And totally deliver me from the 
power of in-dwelling sin.

CHORUS
Redemption by power,
Oh wretched slave I was made,
Who shall deliver me from the 
bonds of slavery?
And who shall set me free,
Taking me from my captivity?
But I thank God through Jesus 
Christ,
And His death on Calvary,
It brought for me redemption by 
power.
Redemption by blood, redemption 
by power, 
In completeness and joy
Redemption for me."
1117;KING THEOPHANY;A;"In sixty-three the Angel came
With the Will and I saw my  name,
Then I knew that I'm a part of 
God's family;
So like Jacob I must fight
With the Angel day and night,
Till those seven rainbow lights  in 
me I see.

CHORUS
This mighty Angel that came to  me,
Is Almighty God, King  Theophany,
The Pillar of Fire that's now 
perfecting me,
In that form He came to me all the 
way from Eternity,
Oh, Hallelujah, I am sure of victory!

Those unclean spirits just like  frogs
That came out of the dragon's  mouth
Are deceiving all the kings on 
earth today:
Religious men have been sealed 
out
By the doctrine that came out;
Saying that Jesus Christ our Lord 
is three indeed.

Seven Spirits of our God, 
Seven Voices thundering out,
The Seven Virtues of our God  into 
my soul,
Supernatural devils are coming  on, 
The greatest contest now is on;
But by the Spirit's Sword I'll 
overcome them all.

This Mighty Angel, He's the One,
That my heart is centered on,
He's the One that means the  most in 
all my life;
For He has promised in His Word
Speak and in my heart believe,
Whatsoever I ask, 
He, this Mighty Angel will perform."
1118;RIGHT WHERE I BELONG;C;"Who am I anyway?
I'm just a little lump of clay,
And if my strength is to no avail,
Yet it doesn't mean that I have 
failed,
For when I'm weak Lord, You're 
made strong,
So there is nothing going wrong,
You've brought me to that place,
Right where I belong.

CHORUS
Right where I belong,
Your grace and Your love through 
the years
Have brought me along,
Who am I, who am I?
That You've taken me from the pit,
To heavenly places with You I sit,
You've brought me to that place,
Right where I belong.

Who am I? Lord consider me,
I'm just a little lump of vanity,
Like a flower that blooms and 
fades away,
Its mortal life withers every day.
But Lord, You've given me eternal 
life:
You've even called me Your 
virtuous wife;
You've brought me to a place,
Right where I belong.

Who am I? Lord let me die,
Just let Your Name be glorified,
At Your service Lord, here I 
stand,
Your wish, oh Lord is my command;
For You died to set me free,
And You did it so willingly,
To bring me to this place,
Right where I belong."
1119;HE CARETH FOR YOU;D;"He careth for you,
He careth for you;
Through sunshine or shadow,
He careth for you."
1120;THINGS THAT ARE TO BE;F;"What is this strange feeling I feel  in 
the air?
I feel that there are Theophanies 
everywhere,
The Heavenly Host and the earthly 
host uniting,
There's going to be a rapture in 
the air,
What an atmosphere!

CHORUS
Things that are to be,        }
What we feel in our hearts,   }

Are things that are to be.       } 2x

By vindicated prophecy,
Modern events being made clear
By vindicated prophecy,
Things that are to be.

The Capstone came shouting 
'Grace, Grace, Grace!'
To cap off the Pyramid of our  lives.
Here we stand in God's image
and likeness,
We are flesh of His flesh and  bone 
of His bone,
There's never been a people like 
 this.

The Dove of Agape love flew into 
our hearts
Bringing comfort, peace, joy and 
love;
This mortal shall put on 
immortality,
This corruptible shall be 
incorruptible for all eternity"
1121;ALIVE AND WELL;D;"He's alive and well,
The stone's been rolled away;
He's alive and well,
He's no longer where He laid;
He's alive and well,
I can hear the angels say;
Let all the world rejoice,
He's alive."
1122;LET GLORY FILL THIS PLACE;G;"The Most High God dwelleth not
In temples made of human hands,
But our hearts He has chosen
To be His dwelling place,
A people saved by His grace.

CHORUS
We are Your hands, Your feet,
With Your body You have built 
this sanctuary.
Now let Your love and Your 
peace;
Let Your presence sanctify and 
make it holy.

Let Your glory Lord, fill this  place,}3x
{Let Your weary find rest in this 
sanctuary,} 3x
You have made.

Beyond human reason, this
place You have chosen,
Another wilderness You have 
 transformed.
With Your prisoners of love,
And Your anointing from above;
Another paradox You have 
performed.

Your beauty and character we 
have seen in each other,
As we worked together in one 
accord.
We've seen Your power on 
display,
You've answered when we 
prayed,
Through hard trials You made a 
way.

Let every lively stone in this 
building,
Shout the praise of God (Praise 
the Lord,)
Let the door of each heart be open
To welcome in the Lord,
Let the pillars stand in position,
And support the house of God.
Let the priest cry Holy! Holy! 
(Holy, Holy,)
Let us give thanks to the Lord."
1123;THE MOST HOLY ONE;C;"We are living in a time of 
investigation judgement,
The wrath of God has been 
revealed from Heaven;
The world is heading for total 
destruction,
Soon the righteous shall walk on 
the ashes of wicked men.

CHORUS
For they with wicked hands have 
crucified
The Most Holy One In a most cruel 
way .
They have rejected the greatest light
That has ever shone since creation.
Men's hearts are failing, failing for 
 fear
Seeing that coming destruction is 
drawing near,
They have sinned and sinned 
away their day of grace;
Loving their religious works more 
than the Revealed Word.

Now he that has ears to hear,
Let him hear what the Spirit is 
saying;
The Token must be on display
So we won't be a castaway;
For this world has been indicted 
and put on trial,
And have become souls in prison."
1124;THE MOVE IS ON;C;"The move is on my Lord,
The move is on;
The move is on my Lord,
The move is on;
I can hear the rustle in the 
mulberry trees,
And I know, I know, I know the 
move is on.

Move on brother, move on sister,
This is the moving day,
Move a little closer,
Where the streams are flowing;
Move on, brother, move on."
1125;LIVE RIGHT;G;"Blessed is the man whom the  Lord 
will find
Doing His perfect will, all the  time.
Though mortal strength faileth,
He's not weary yet,
His labours of love, the Lord  will 
never forget.

CHORUS
We will live right, everyday,         }
'Cause Jesus can come now   }
just any day.      }2x
Blessed are your eyes, for the 
things that they see,
Many prophets of old have 
inquired diligently;
For no more darkly do we see  but 
face to face.

Lift your hands and praise the  Lord 
for amazing grace.
Blessed are your ears, for the 
things that they hear;
Many uncertain sounds are 
everywhere
For the gospel trumpet sounded 
sweet jubilee.

Lift your hands and praise the  Lord 
Who has set you free.
Gird up your loins, ye mighty  men 
of war;
Full obedience to God's Word  and 
victory is sure;
For perfect faith is strong and 
knows no defeat.
For the God of this world must 
wriggle under our feet.

Punish with vengeance all 
iniquity,
By confessing your faults with 
sincerity.
You must say ""Satan you have no 
place in me!
Let the Royal Vesture be now  put 
on me."""
1126;THE GREAT EXODUS;Fm;"The Lord has called a great  
Exodus in this evil day,
For He has promised in His Word 
that a people
Must be changed and taken away;
Once again the Token is required 
of every man,
As the death angel moves  swiftly 
throughout the land;
For the plagues of Egypt are 
throughout the land,
Gross darkness on the people  they 
don't understand
We are living in the time of   }
mercy and judgement.      } 2x

The mystery Cloud has shown the 
Supreme Judge in our day,
He'll judge and make war with  evil 
Scientists
Who have despised His way;
They are corrupting and destroying 
the earth with Satan's wisdom,
They've made it a time bomb 
activated for sure destruction;
But rejoice you saints who sigh 
and cry,
The Cloud has brought our 
redemption nigh;
You shall leap over walls       }
into a new dimension.       } 2x

Volcanic lava shall spew forth  from 
the centre of the earth,
A regeneration to a new 
civilization, This earth shall give 
birth;
But like Noah, we shall be lifted 
above the judgements again,
When fire and hailstones fall from 
the skies like rain;
For on the ashes of the wicked 
shall the righteous stand,
The meek of the earth shall inherit 
the land;
Oh rejoice ye citizens of new } 
Jerusalem.         } 2x

Your tormentors and oppressors  you 
shall see them no more,
For the Holy Fire of God's  wrath 
shall make your exodus  sure;
No more demons to disrupt and 
pollute our atmosphere,
God will purge the earth;
The rivers of water shall be crystal 
clear;
Edenic beauty shall cover the 
earth again,
No more sickness, no more 
sorrows, no more pain;
God and man, heaven and  earth  }
will be one again.   } 2x"
1127;THANKS, THANKS;F;"Thank You Lord for the strength 
you give
To simply carry on
Through those scolds and tests,
And the worst and best,
I'm never left alone.
You're always right beside me
To hear me when I pray.
Since I first began You've been my 
dearest friend,
I give You all the praise.

CHORUS
Thanks, Thanks I give you thanks,
For all You've done.
I am so blessed,
My soul has found rest,
Oh Lord, I give You thanks.
I give You thanks this moment
And I will continually.

For each day I live Your grace
You give,
I am blessed abundantly,
And I won't forget that moment
When, in my life, You made such a 
change.
Since the Spirit came I've not been 
the same,
I want to give You praise."
1128;LORD LIFT ME UP;F;"Thy steadfast love oh Lord
Extends unto the heavens,
And Thy faithfulness unto the 
clouds.
I feel the cold winds of judgement 
blowing,
The Northerner is coming,
The Great White Eagle must 
appear anytime now.

CHORUS
To lift me up on the seventh 
mountain,
Bear me on Your eagle wings so 
strong.
Lord lift me up on the seventh 
mountain,
I feel in my heart it's the place 
where I belong.

In my heart's a desperation,
An anointed expectation,
That a paradox must be performed;
For the deep in me is calling,
For that super anointing,
Where divine love and power just 
take supreme control.

On my ash heap waiting for Your 
divine promise,
Your response to my faith in Your 
Word;
Still trusting in You my Saviour
My absolute forever;
That You'll finish the work in me 
You have begun.

I'm looking beyond my afflictions
To a perfect restoration,
A new body Thou has prepared for
me;
I'm tired of this dimension,
Of its chaos and confusion,
A new heaven and a new earth I 
long to see."
1129;BACK TO EDEN;D;"We're going back to Eden
To claim what was lost,
For the Book has been opened,
Our names It revealed;
There are footprints before us 
That show us the way,
There's a Presence goes with us;
So we will not stray.

CHORUS
Oh beautiful Eden!
Sweet home of the blest,
That's prepared for the faithful,
Who hath the Thunders retained;
We'll sing of His praises,
Our Lord we shall see,
We will live in His glory;
And in His likeness we'll be.

All our signs and our seasons  are 
mile posted there,
So the demons of reasoning
Would give up in despair;
We have claims of assurance,
The Abstract Title Deed;
It's the land of our Fathers,
And we are true seeds.

We are nearing the end now,
Of our journey back home;
Let's keep pressing onwards ,
And let the Thunders roll;
We who once were afar off
Are being drawn nigh,
By the Word full of power
Victory is in sight."
1130;SWEETER AS THE DAYS GO;F;"He gets sweeter as the days go 
by,
He gets sweeter as the moments 
fly,
His love is richer, fuller, deeper, 
sweeter,
He gets sweeter, and sweeter and 
sweeter as the days go by."
1131;HE'S COMING SOON;G;"In these, the closing days of time,
What joy the glorious hope affords,
That soon - oh, wondrous truth 
sublime!
He shall reign, King of kings and 
Lord of lords.

CHORUS
He's coming soon, He's coming 
soon;
With joy we welcome His returning;
It may be morn, it may be night or 
noon,
We know He's coming soon.

The signs around, in earth and air,
Or painted on the starlit sky,
God's faithful witnesses declare
That the coming of the Saviour 
draweth nigh.

The dead in Christ who 'neath us 
lie,
In countless numbers, all shall rise,
When through the portals of the 
sky
He shall come to prepare our 
Paradise.

And we who, living, yet remain,
Caught up, shall meet our faithful 
Lord; 
This hope we cherish not in vain,
But we comfort one another by this 
word."
1132;HIS BANNER OVER ME IS;D;"His banner over me is love
His banner over me is love
He brought me in to His 
banqueting house and His 
banner over me is love
Is love, is love, 
His banner over me is love
He brought me in to His 
banqueting house and His 
banner over me is love."
1133;THE SOUNDS OF HIS…;C;"I can hear the sounds of His 
coming everywhere,
In the headlines, resounded by the 
score,
It may be another earthquake or 
just another war,
But to every child of God it's 
something more;
And when I hear the sound of 
marching,
Hear the sound of battle cry,
Then I know my Lord is coming, 
even now,
It may be nigh.

CHORUS
And I can hear the sounds of His 
coming everywhere,
They're getting louder and louder 
each day,
And they will crescendo unto that 
last and final sound,
When the trumpet shall call me 
 away. 

I can hear the sound of fig leaves
Rustling in the summer breeze,
As I see the Lord restore Jerusalem;
And I can hear a sound from 
Heaven
As a mighty rushing wind,
As God pours His Spirit out upon 
all men;
And when I hear revival sounds
Not just here but everywhere,
Then I know its almost over, 
I can feel it in the air."
1134;SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL;D;"Something beautiful, 
Something good;
All my confusion 
He understood;
All I had to offer Him
Was brokenness and strife,
But He made something beautiful 
of my life."
1135;THE MEETING IN THE AIR;G;"You have heard of little Moses in 
the bulrush,
You have heard of fearless David 
and his sling;
You have heard the story told of 
dreaming Joseph,
And of Jonah and the whale you 
often sing.
There are many, many others 
through the Bible,
I should like to meet them all, I do 
declare!
By and by the Lord will surely let 
us meet them
At the meeting in the air.

CHORUS
There is going to be a meeting in 
the air,
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you, meet you 
there
In that home beyond the sky;
Such singing you will hear, never 
heard by mortal ear,
'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son will be the 
leading One
At the meeting in the air.

Many things will there be missing, 
in that meeting:
For the mourners bench will have 
no place at all;
There will never be a sermon 
preached to sinners,
For the sinner had refused to heed 
the call.
There will be no mourning over 
wayward loved ones,
There will be no lonely nights of 
pleading prayer;
All our burdens and our anguish 
will be lifted
At the meeting in the air.

There the doubters will be missing 
altogether,
All the skeptics will be absent on 
that day;
There will be no grumblers present 
to disturb us,
And the Achans will be busy far 
away.
There the saints will have His ""seal 
upon their foreheads,""
Dressed in raiment none but 
ransomed ones can wear;
All who have the wedding 
garments will be present
At the meeting in the air."
1136;HOLY GHOST REVIVAL;D;"The land is laying barren,
Desolation every where,
The harvest that we longed for,
We looked, but it's not there,
The devil sows his evil seed,
Thwarts the Master's plan,
But tired and so weary,
God's servants work as fast they 
can.

CHORUS
Send down the Holy Ghost revival,
Revive us.
Send the rain from heaven,
Flood our thirsty souls.
We need the Holy Ghost revival,
Revive us Lord,
Open up the heavens, take 
 control.

Now the skies seem brass above 
us 
As we look for the promised rain.
God's servants sow the seed of 
precious truth,
Just to reap a golden grain;
But the Spirit's power is what we 
need
To see the harvest come,
So, Lord send the Holy Spirit;
Come and glorify Your Son."

day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the 
way,
To prepare us a dwelling place 
there.

CHORUS
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful 
shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful 
shore.

We shall sing on that beautiful 
shore,
The melodious songs of the 
blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no 
more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of 
rest.

To our bountiful Father above,
We will offer our tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love,
And the blessings that hallow our 
days."
1139;I SEE THE LORD;C;"I see the Lord, 
I see the Lord,
Exalted high upon the worship
Of the people of the Lord.

I see the Lord, 
I see the Lord,
Mine eyes have seen the King,
The Lamb who left the throne,
Who reigns  forevermore.

The train of His robe
Fills the temple,
A cloud of heavenly worshipers 
surrounding His throne,
We join with them now crying Holy, 
Holy, is the Lamb!
The Lamb alone!"
1140;OUR LORD'S RETURN;F;"I am watching for the coming of 
the glad millennial day, 
When our blessed Lord shall come 
and catch His waiting Bride away;
Oh! my heart is filled with rapture as 
I labour, watch and pray,
For our Lord is coming back to 
earth again.

CHORUS
Oh! our Lord is coming back to 
earth again,
Yes, our Lord is coming back to 
earth again,
Satan will be bound a thousand 
years, we'll have no tempter then,
After Jesus shall come back to 
earth again.

Jesus' coming back will be the 
answer to earth's sorrowing cry,
For the knowledge of the Lord shall 
fill the earth and sea and sky;
God shall take away all sickness and 
the sufferer's tears will dry,
When our Saviour shall come back 
to earth again.

Yes, the ransomed of the Lord shall 
come to Zion then with joy,
And in all His holy mountain nothing
hurts or shall destroy;
Perfect peace shall reign in every 
heart, and love without alloy,
After Jesus shall come back to 
earth again.

Then the sin and sorrow, pain and 
death of this dark world shall cease,
In a glorious reign with Jesus of a 
thousand years of peace;
All the earth is groaning, crying for 
that day of sweet release,
For our Jesus to come back to 
earth again."
1141;WHEN THE ROLL IS CALLED;F;"When the trumpet of the Lord shall 
sound,
And time shall be no more,
And the morning breaks eternal, 
bright and fair;
When the saved of earth shall gather 
over on the other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.

CHORUS
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.

On that bright and cloudless 
morning when the dead in Christ 
shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection 
share;
When His chosen ones shall gather 
to their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll 
be there.

Let us labour for the Master from 
the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous love 
and care;
Then when all of life is over, 
And our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll 
be there."
1142;PYRAMID MOUNTAIN;G;"Pyramid mountain
All over the earth,
God's divine nature
In sinful earth;
People who possess the new birth
Will be pyramid mountains 
All over the earth."
1143;TELL THEM I'M COMING…;C;"If I had a song to sing,
If I could tell the world one thing
From my Lord and my King,
What would I tell them?
As the seasons slip away,
I can almost hear him say,
""Won't you touch someone's heart 
today?
Here's what to tell them.""

CHORUS
""Tell them I'm coming soon,
Tell them I'm coming real soon,
Tell them in your song
It won't be very long,
Until I take them home,
Oh won't you tell them?
Tell them I love them
And I'm coming soon!""

All the signs have made it clear,
The time of the Lord is drawing near,
It's His gentle sweet voice that I hear,
""I want you to tell them.""
He that hath an ear, Let him hear
What the Spirit is saying,
Loud and clear,
Though many may say,
""I've heard it before!""
Tell them just once more."

myself to

And all that You ask of me
Is for You to come and live your life 
in me

CHORUS

that You desire   }
In my life, in my life    } 2x
Work with my hands, speak with my 
lips,
See with my eyes and walk in my feet.
Have the pre-eminence that You 
desire
In my life, in my life.

You never told me to do anything 
But believe your word
For it's not by works least any man 
should boast
But it's amazing grace 
You called me and You chose me
To show forth Your victory and the 
reason of Your death
That in the end I could show forth 
Your praises
For we are Your workmanship created 
by Your grace

All that God was He poured it into 
Christ
All that Christ was He poured in into 
His church
As the Father was in the Son
So is the Son in the Bride
Living, walking, praying, talking
It's Emmanuel, God and man 
United again."
1145;I'M GONNA LET GLORY…;A;"Well I don't know why but I can't 
be shy
When I get around God's people;
I get so inspired my heart's on fire
I lose all control;
Well the Word of God is a 
consuming fire
That's beating in my bosom;
And one of these days I'm gonna 
shout and sing
In the presence of my King.

CHORUS
I'm gonna let the glory roll
When the roll is called in glory,
I'm gonna get beside myself 
When I get beside the King, that 
day.
I'm gonna have the time of my life
When the time of my life is over,
I'm gonna get carried away when I 
get carried away.

I was walking around with a great 
big frown,
I was bound by condemnation,
Till the Pillar of Fire flashed across 
my path
And showed me my salvation;
Where there's God there's peace 
and love
And happiness and gladness,
And I thank Jesus everyday
He took away my sadness.

Now the song I sung, it is nothing 
I've done
But God that showed me mercy;
And I'll tell the story for the good 
Lord's glory,
And to magnify His Name,
So now you've heard so let's stay 
with the Word
And pray for revelation,
And through the power of the 
Word for the hour
We'll overcome temptation."
1146;BY AND BY, MORNING…;F;"We are often tossed and driven

In that land of perfect day, when 
the mists have rolled away,
We will understand it better by 
and by.

CHORUS
By and by when the morning 
comes,
When all the saints of God are 
gathered home,
We will tell the story how we 
overcome,
For we'll understand it better by 
and by.

We are often destitute of the things 
that life demands,
Want of food and want of shelter, 
thirsty hills and barren lands;
But we're trusting in the Lord, and 
according to His Word,
We will understand it better by and 
by.

Trials dark on every hand, and we 
cannot understand,
All the ways that God would lead 
us to that blessed Promised land;
But He guides us with His eye and 
we'll follow till we die.
For we'll understand it better by 
and by.

Temptations, hidden snares often 
take us unawares,
And our hearts are made to bleed 
for many a thoughtless word or 
deed,
And we wonder why the test when 
we try to do our best,
But we'll understand it better by 
and by."
1147;OH, I WANT TO SEE HIM;F;"As I journey through the land, 
singing as I go,
Pointing souls to Calvary, to the 
crimson flow, 
Many arrows pierce my soul from 
without, within;
But my Lord leads me on, through 
Him I must win.

CHORUS
Oh, I want to see Him, look upon 
His face,
There to sing forever of His saving 
grace;
On the streets of Glory let me lift 
my voice;
Cares all past, home at last, ever 
to rejoice.

When in service for my Lord, dark 
may be the night,
But I'll cling more close to Him, He 
will give me light;
Satan's snares may vex my soul, 
turn my thoughts aside;
But my Lord goes ahead, leads 
whate'er betide.

When in valleys low I look toward 
the mountain height,
And behold my Saviour there, 
leading in the fight,
With a tender hand outstretched 
toward the valley low;
Guiding me, I can see, as I onward 
go.

When before me billows rise from 
the mighty deep,
Then my Lord directs my bark, He 
doth safely keep,
And He leads me gently on 
through this world below;
He's a real Friend to me, O I love 
Him so."
1148;JUST OVER IN GLORY LAND;G;"I've a home prepared where the 
saints abide,
Just over in the glory land;
And I long to be by my Saviour's 
side,
Just over in the glory land.

CHORUS
Just over in the glory land,
I'll join the happy angel band,
Just over in the glory land;
Just over in the glory land,
There with the mighty host I'll 
stand,
Just over in the glory land.

I am on my way to those mansions
fair,
Just over in the glory land;
There to sing God's praise and His 
glory share,
Just over in the glory land.

What a joyful thought that my Lord 
I'll see,
Just over in the glory land;
And with kindred saved, there 
forever be,
Just over in the glory land.

With the blood-washed throng I will 
shout and sing,
Just over in the glory land;
Glad hosannas to Christ, the Lord 
and King,
Just over in the glory Land."
1149;I DON'T KNOW WHAT;D;"I don't know what you came for,
But I came to worship the Lord.
I don't know what you came for,
But I came to worship the Lord.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, I came to 
worship the Lord,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah I came to 
worship the Lord."
1150;THE DAY OF REDEMPTION;D;"Nations are breaking, Israel's 
awaking,
The signs that the prophets 
foretold;
The Gentile days numbered, with 
horrors encumbered;
Eternity soon will unfold.

CHORUS
The day of redemption is near,
Men's hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit, your lamps 
trimmed and clear,
Look up! your redemption is near.

The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem's restoring
Her national life, long dethroned;
Today she is calling, her latter 
rain's falling
""Return, O dispersed, to your own.""

Heaven's powers are shaking, and 
many are mistaking
God's meaning to be of the sky;
God's Church is the power that's 
shaking this hour;
The day of redemption is nigh.

False prophets are lying, God's 
Truth they're denying,
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generation spurns 
God's revelation,
We'll walk where the apostles 
have trod."
1151;THE FAMILY OF GOD;D;"I'm so glad I'm a part of the family 
of God,
I've been washed in the fountain,
Cleansed by His blood,
Joint heirs with Jesus,
As we travel this road;
For I'm part of the family,
The family of God."
1152;I WANT TO GO;F;"A burning desire in me
To be more like Thee
Is growing stronger everyday;
I'm burdened in my soul,
Perfection is my goal,
To walk with You in perfect 
harmony.

CHORUS
I want to go 
where You want me to,
Send me Lord 
to do the things You do,
My Lord, I want to go.
I want to feel 
Your presence near,
Perfect love
Casting out all fears,
My Lord, I want to feel.

You've taken away my shame,
Given me a part of Your name,
Set Your Holy Seal upon me.
I'm thankful for Your grace,
You've made me a winner in life's 
race;
Now I give myself to You 
 unreservedly.

I'm casting my reasoning down,
Listening for that certain sound,
That still small voice deep in my 
soul;
To lead me where I should go,
Perfect will to daily know
That unto You my works be fulfilled.

Let Your anointing flow,
Keeping my light aglow
Amidst this world of darkness, sin 
and shame;
Keep pouring Your latter rain,
Faith to use Your power again
That I may return to You from 
whence I came.

CHORUS
I want to go to that place prepared 
for me,
Oh, that mansion, my theophany,
My Lord, I want to go.
I want to feel greater realities,
Perfect love throughout eternity,
My Lord, I want to feel"
1153;WE'RE MARCHING TO ZION;F;"Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.

CHORUS
We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King,
But children of the heavenly King,
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heavenly 
fields,
Before we reach the heavenly 
fields,
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;
We're marching thru Immanuel's 
ground,
We're marching thru Immanuel's 
ground,
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high."
1154;WE ADORE YOU F;F;"We adore You
Holy Spirit, 
You are welcome in this place;
We adore You
Holy Spirit
You are welcome in this place."
1155;I'M GONNA BE GONE;F;"I'm gonna be gone
In the twinkling of an eye,
I'm gonna be gone
I won't have time to say good-bye.
I'm gonna be gone,
Could be while I'm singing this 
song,
I'm gonna be gone,
It won't be long,
I'm gonna be gone.

This old world is not getting better,
Every day it's getting worse,
So much fighting and confusion
Going on down here on earth,
But I don't let that bother me
Cause I'm not here to stay,
I know my Lord is coming soon
And I'll be called away.

It could be just any morning,
It could be at night or noon,
We don't know just when He's 
coming,
But we know He's coming soon.
I can say we've some assurance
This old world is not my home,
One of these days you gonna look 
for me,
Praise God I'm gonna be gone!"
1156;SWING LOW, SWEET CHARIOT;F;"I looked over Jordan and what did 
I see,
Coming for to carry me home;
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

CHORUS
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do,
Coming for to carry me home;
Tell all my friends I'm a-coming too,
Coming for to carry me home."
1157;I'M LOOKING FOR  CHANGE;D;"I've come a long way,
I've had fears and doubts,
But in Your mind Lord,
You knew I couldn't live with them;
So You chose at this time,
To wave before me
The thing You knew would  make me
Give up myself and my thoughts.
It could never have worked by  my 
own works,
But of faith that it might be by  grace;
To the end the promise might be 
sure to all the seed,
Unto us, of the faith of Abraham.

CHORUS
I'm now looking for the promise of 
my new body,
As my earth quakes all my sin is 
shaken off;
The Holy Fire from above puts sin 
out of existence,
For Holiness cannot dwell    }
in sinful earth.      } 2x

But while I am here living in this 
world, I live by the faith of the Son of 
God revealed in  me;
To believe His word and claim 
what's my own,
By promise it was freely given  to me,
And when it seems that there's no 
hope, believe in hope,
And consider not the things which 
my eyes see;
But look into the Word of God
That shall not pass away,
And its righteousness which is by 
faith.

I'm living in the day
When my desert is blossoming like a 
rose, I'm living in the day,
When my thorns are unfolding to 
leaves again,
True fellowship is being restored
It's the promise of the Lord;
I'm looking now for the promise of 
my change,
I'm looking now for the promise of 
my new body;
I'm looking now for the promise  of 
my change."
1158;WHAT A DAY THAT WILL BE;F;"There is coming a day when no 
heartaches shall come,
No more clouds in the sky, no 
more tears to dim the eye;
All is peace forevermore on that 
happy golden shore,
What a day, glorious day that will 
be.

CHORUS
What a day that will be when my 
Jesus I shall see,
And I look upon His face, the One 
who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand, 
and leads me through the 
promised Land,
What a day, glorious day that will be.

There'll be no sorrow there, no 
more burdens to bear,
No more sickness, no pain, no 
more parting over there;
And forever I will be with the One 
who died for me,
What a day, glorious day that will 
be."
1159;I AM NOT ASHAMED;F;"I am not ashamed of the gospel,
The gospel of Jesus Christ.
I am not afraid to be counted,
But I'm willing to give my life.
See, I'm willing to be 
All He wants me to be,
Give up the wrong for the right;
I am not ashamed of the gospel
Of Jesus Christ. 

I've got to much behind me
To let this world blind me,
To some He's a name
But to me He's my everything.
I am not ashamed of the gospel,
I am not ashamed of the gospel,
of Jesus Christ."
1160;LOOK FOR ME;D;"When you finally make your 
entrance to that city,
Oh, just to walk on that bright 
golden avenue;
As you behold all its beauty and its 
splendour,
Remember there's just one 
request I beg of you.

CHORUS
Look for me,
For I will be there too.
I realize when you arrive,
There'll be so much to view;
After you've been there
Ten thousand years,
A million, maybe two,
Look for me;
For I will be there too.

As you go down your list of firsts, 
There's no question,
You'll want to see your loved ones
waiting there for you;
And when you feel you've shared 
your story with the last one
That wants to hear you tell just 
how you've made it through."
1161;I'VE GOT SOMETHING;G;"I've got something that the world 
can't give,
And the world can't take it away;
I've got something that the world 
can't give,
And it keeps me day by day,
I've got something worth talking 
about,
It makes me sing and it makes me 
shout;
I've got something that the world 
can't give,
And the world can't take it away.

1162;THE RAPTURE;F;"Sometimes it seems like nothing's 
going on,
So it might seem to the natural mind;
But don't you know my friend,
Great things happen in silence;
Have you ever heard the sun rise?
Have you ever seen the flower 
grow?
And in this half an hour silence,
There are people becoming the 
Word.

CHORUS
Many are changing from  }
glory unto glory,     } 
Hearts are being raptured } 
up into glory;    } 
People walking holy unto      } 
the Lord,      }
It won't be long and we'll     }
be gone.         }2x

God's great mystery's been 
unfolding
In such a silent way,
He hid it from the wise and prudent,
Revealed it to babes;
Why don't you look in and see
God in simplicity?
Christ is unveiled before our eyes, 
Can't you see?

Let's search our lives my 
brothers, 
This is a treacherous hour;
Search your lives my sisters,
It's not easy to be left back in this 
hour ."
1163;COME AND FILL US NOW;F;"We have come into thy presence 
Lord, come and fill us now.
We have come into thy presence 
Lord, come and fill us now.
With our hearts lifted up,
We open our hearts to you Lord.
With our hearts lifted up,
We glorify your name."
1164;WHEN THEY RING THE BELLS;C;"There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore by 
faith's decree;
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells for 
you and me.

CHORUS
Don't you hear the bells now 
ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee.
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for 
you and me.

We shall know no sin or sorrow,
In the haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond 
the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells for 
you and me.

When our days shall know their 
number,
When in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the 
spirit to be free;
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely aiden,
When they ring the golden bells for 
you and me."
1165;HOLD ON MY CHILD;D;"Hold on my child,
Joy comes in the morning.
Weeping only lasts 
For the night.
Hold on my child,
Joy comes in the morning,
The darkest hour
Means dawn is just in sight."
1166;ANGELS STEP ASIDE;G;"What a celebration on that day,
It can't be very far away;
Heaven's Bridegroom has 
descended,
The ransomed bride of God ascends;
Heaven's bell will sweetly ring,
Choir of angels start to sing,
Pick up your trumpet Gabriel and 
blow.

CHORUS
Here comes the bride to be ever at 
His side,
Oh, what a spotless bride!
Oh, what a glorious sight!
Here come the chosen ones,
Here come the ransomed ones,
Angels step aside,
For here comes the bride;
Angels step aside,
For here comes the bride.

Some from every nation will be there,
Wearing spotless robes
So bright and fair.
All of Heaven will behold,
The bride is marching down the 
streets of gold, 
Getting ready now to go, 
The very hour no one seems to know,
Pick up your trumpet Gabriel and 
 blow.

Bro. Branham saw them in preview
But now they are in plain view
All of heaven will behold
The bride is marching down the 
streets of gold
Getting ready now to go
The very hour no one seems to know
Pick up your trumpet Gabriel and 
blow"

1168;SEE YOU IN THE RAPTURE;C;"If we never meet again
On this earth, my precious friend;
If to God you have been true,
And we've lived above all sin,
Then for us there'll be a greeting,
For there's going to be a meeting,
I'll see you in the rapture 
Some sweet day.

CHORUS
I'll see you in the rapture,
See you in the rapture,
See you at that meeting in the air;
There with our blessed Saviour
We'll live and reign forever,
I'll see you in the rapture
Some sweet day.

To my loved ones let me say
That there'll surely come a day,
When the Lord will come again;
And He'll take his Bride away,
Do get ready now to meet Him,
And with hallelujahs greet Him,
I'll see you in the rapture
Some sweet day."
1169;SHELTERED IN THE ARMS;F;"I feel the touch of hands so warm 
and tender,
They're leading me 
Through paths that I must trod;
I'll have no fear for Jesus walks 
beside me,
For I'm sheltered in the arms of God.

CHORUS
So let the storm rage high and 
dark clouds rise,
They won't worry me;
For, I'm sheltered safe within the 
arms of God.
He walks with me and naught on 
earth can harm me
For I'm sheltered in the arms of God.

Soon I shall hear the call from 
Heaven's portals,
""Come home my child, it's the last 
step you have trod,""
I will be changed and taken to 
God's New Heaven,
For I'm sheltered in the arms of God."
1170;I WILL PRAISE HIM;C;"When I saw the cleansing 
fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing
When He said, ""Wilt thou be 
clean?""

CHORUS
I will praise Him, I will praise Him,
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain,
Give Him glory all ye people,
For His blood can wash away each 
stain.

Though the way seemed straight 
and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions plans and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him,
Glory! glory to His Name.

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in;
He's forgiven my transgression,
He has cleansed my heart from sin."
1171;FOR I WAS BORN TO BE;F;"For I was born to be
Thy dwelling place,
A home for the presence of the

1173;OUR TREASURES;F;"Set your eyes on that mountain top; 
And To adoption let us rise.
Look not to shallow ground, 
Worldly pleasures around;
It's an Eden to despise.
For our journey has almost come to 
the end
We have passed two-thirds of the way
Just a few more steps are all to go
Then we would be taken away.

CHORUS
Our treasures lie just beyond that 
mountain,
All the glories of the Lord there we 
shall share.
Our treasures lie just beyond that 
 mountain,
Have no fear, have no fear, 
You will be there.

Jesus said it's a narrow rugged way,
And few there be that find it,
But broad is the way which leads to 
destruction
Where millions travel along,
But though our trials are tough and 
afflictions much,
It's not worthy to be compared
With the joys that the faithful 
servants of God
Someday shall surely share.

Set your eyes on the White rock
That Light is now shining on,
Turn not your eyes away from God's 
message today,
Till you shine with the light of the Son.
For you've been made by God to be 
a reflection of Him,
Let it be settled in your heart and mind

That we are a Super Race ordained 
of Grace;
And there's where happiness you 
will find.
Shoo those buzzards off your sacrifice
When temptations come your  way,
Believe not the devil's lie, 
Though those vultures fly,
Continue to watch and pray.

For there's a path that the eye of  the 
vulture,
Has never, ever seen,
Where you as an eagle can fly 
perfectly justified
For you are a heavenly being."
1174;NEVER BEEN HOMESICK;F;"There's a light in the window,
The table's spread in splendour;
Someone's, standing at the open 
door,
I can see the crystal river,
So I must be near forever;
Lord, I've never been this 
homesick before.

CHORUS
See the bright Light shine,
It's just about home time,
I can see My Father standing at 
the door,
This world's been a wilderness,
I'm ready for deliverance,
Lord, I've never been this 
homesick before.

I can see my family gather,
Sweet faces all familiar,
No one's old or feeble anymore,
This lonesome heart is crying;
Think I'll spread my wings for flying,
Lord, I've never been this 
homesick before."
1175;WE'RE GOING HOME;D;"We're going home in the morning,
Going home in the morning.
For the trumpet shall sound
And the dead in Christ shall rise

in the morning.

Shalom, Shalom! 
It is morning……
Wake up, wake up! 
It is morning……"
1176;THANK GOD I AM FREE;G;"For a long time I travelled
Down a long lonely road,
My heart was so heavy, 
In sin I sank low.
Then I heard about Jesus,
What a wonderful hour,
I'm so glad that I found out
He would bring me out, 
Thru His saving power.

CHORUS
Thank God I am free, free, free
from this world of sin.
Washed in the blood of Jesus,
I've been born again.
Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, 
saved
By His wonderful grace.
I'm so glad that I found out
He would bring me out and 
show me the way.

Like a bird out of prison
that's taken his flight;
Like the blind man that God
gave back his sight.
Like a poor wretched beggar
That's found fortune and fame,
I'm so glad that I found out,
He would bring me out,
Thru His Holy name."
1177;I'M A NEW CREATION;F;"Hallelujah! He redeemed me,
I've been born again to win;
I thank God He justified me,
Of His fullness, have we all 
received of Him.
I'm a new creation,
I'm a brand new man;
Old things are passed away,
I've been born again,
More than a conqueror;
That's who I am,
I'm a new creation;
I'm a brand new man."
1178;RAPTURING FAITH;F;"Rapturing Faith 
Is the hunger of my soul today.
Rapturing Grace,
To be changed and taken away.

CHORUS
The Trumpet shall sound and the 
dead shall rise,
And our Lord will be waiting in the 
skies.
Then we who remain, shall be 
 changed
In the twinkling of an eye.

Right now we are groaning,
The whole creation is moaning,
Waiting on our Lord
To claim what He has restored;
We are His purchased possession
By His Blood of redemption.

We are a new creation
Through His divine revelation.
I know it is hard,
But saints I know it ain't so bad,
There're many worse than me and 
you,
And they don't even know what to 
 do.

But it's not so in our case,
For we have Rapturing Grace,
Jesus has gone to prepare a 
place,
We are the winners in this race.
Glory, Glory, Glory! 
Hallelujah to His name!
Yesterday, today and forever,
Our Jesus is the same."
1179;HE'S EVERYTHING TO ME;Eb;"He's everything
He's everything to me;
He's everything
He's everything to me;
He's my father, my mother, 
my sister and my brother,
He's everything to me."
1180;THE BRIDAL CALL;D;"God has promised 
a rapture in this day,
A Bride He's preparing to take 
away;
But only His elected ones will go,
And we shall be with our blessed 
Saviour forever more.

CHORUS
So we must get our lamps trimmed 
and filled with oil,
Don't get your garments spotted 
by the things of this world;
But only watch and pray to the 
coming of that day,
When we shall see our blessed 
Saviour face to face.

O sinner please harken to His call,
For this might be the last time you 
hear His voice;
For this word you hear shall be 
heard no more,
When the bridegroom comes to 
take His bride away.

O Christian, don't get tied up with 
this world,
Keep your garments snowy white to 
the coming of the Lord;
For we don't have much time 
again,
For He shall come and 
He shall not tarry, tarry no more.

What a glorious day when the 
trumpet of the Lord shall sound;
The sleeping saints 
shall rise to meet the Lord,
And we who are alive and remain
Shall be caught up 
to meet them in the air."

With my possession gone, my

Are enough to break me,
Yet my integrity will I retain. 

CHORUS
I shall not die, but live,
Live and declare Thy works oh God,
Though my trials have been much, 
I'm not given unto death.
And because I must declare 
Your name,
I shall not die but live.

Though I be cast into prison,
Fleeing temptation, 
standing for my Lord,
Yet the things 
that God has shown me
Shall come to pass,
And His glory shall be my reward.

CHORUS
I shall not die but live,
Live and declare Thy works, 
oh God.
Though my temptations 
have  been strong,
I'm not given unto death,
And because I must declare 
Your name,
I shall not die but live.

Though I be in the midst of trouble, 
Hear my cry Lord, save my soul,
For though I'm cast out of Thy 
sight, Lord;
Yet raise me up;
For I must declare 
Your name to a dying world.

CHORUS
I shall not die, but live,
Live and declare Thy works oh God,
Though my chastening has been 
sore,
I'm not given unto death,
And because I must declare Your 
name,
I shall not die but live."
1183;SEVEN THUNDER…;C;"Seven thunders in chapter 10 of 
Revelation 
Was prophesied and is now fulfilled 
in this end time
The seventh angel heard the shout, 
knew what it said and uttered it out
And all the mysteries that was 
sealed up are now opened.

CHORUS 
Seven thunder people 
Walking to perfection
Seven thunder people 
Walking to adoption
We have seen our names within
And our lives are free from sin
Seven thunder people walking to 
translation (walking to full 
redemption)

Showers of revelation rained in 1980
And our eyes were made to see our 
own prophecy
That we are a super race, an 
invincible army
And our captain is our King 
Theopany

Since brother Branham has come 
and gone church, where are we?
Have you the token, its token time as 
far as we see (Oh can't you see?)
We are now in the second fold 
underneath the Seventh Seal
And all the Bride prophecies are 
becoming history.

Seven thunders uttered outside the 
seven church ages
Revealing new things, releasing all 
God's fullness 
We know the whole counsel of God, 
operating the spoken word
And proving this is that promise 
since June the third.

The Seventh Seal were never 
spoken, it was a secret
It was hidden between the sixth and 
seventh trumpet
A prophet saw it in the shout and 
was commissioned to echo it out
And Spirit-spoken words came out of 
his mouth
We the destined ones are crossing 
over Jordan
Entering into the blessed third pull 
land"
1184;COME AND DINE;A;"Jesus has a table spread where 
the saints of God are fed,
He invites His chosen people 
""Come and dine;""
With His manna He doth feed and 
supplies our every need;
O, 'tis sweet to sup with Jesus all 
the time!

CHORUS
""Come and dine,"" the Master 
calleth, 
""Come and dine,""
You may feast at Jesus' table all 
the time;
He who fed the multitude, turned 
the water into wine,
To the hungry calleth now, ""Come 
and dine.""

The disciples came to land, thus 
obeying Christ's command,
For the Master called to them, 
""Come and dine;""
There they found their hearts' 
desire, bread and fish upon the fire;
Thus He satisfies the hungry every 
time.

Soon the Lamb will take His bride 
to be ever at His side,
All the host of heaven will 
assembled be;
O, 'twill be a glorious sight, all the 
saints in spotless white;
And with Jesus they will feast 
eternally."
1185;IN DEATH THERE'S VICTORY;D;"Up the hill with the load,
Jesus walked up Calvary's road.
No man took His life from Him,
For you and me He willingly gave.
In His mind, He held a vision,
It was of the resurrection,
Truly He paid death's price;
Our victory's complete
In the perfect sacrifice.

CHORUS
In death, in death,
In death, there's victory.
Self sacrifice means freedom,
And this is the way for me.
For the joy set before,
There's a cross to endure.
For real life, this I see,
That in death there's victory.

Abraham held the promise,
'In Isaac shall thy seed be called.'
He died to his own thinking,
When God told him sacrifice his boy.
Obedient unto death he was faithful,
Knowing resurrection was in the 
end.
This he said: ""The lad and I, we'll 
go worship,
And come to you again.""

By faith Jocebed placed Moses
In the mouth of death on the river 
Nile,
Pharaoh's daughter, finding him,
To the house of death she took the 
child,
There he lived with those who 
sought his life,
And to the desert he had to flee,
Where he died to his own  thinking,
To lead Israel to their victory.

Tell me now, Bride of Christ,
We're not different, we must pay 
the price,
As we lift up our cross,
Though we suffer and our lives are 
lost;
Yet we must die to ourselves and 
sin,
Truly become a burnt-offering,
But it's sure in the end,
That we will rise again."
1186;LET THE DOVE LEAD;F;"CHORUS
There's a Message coming forth,
Father, I pray, You'll let the Dove 
lead;
As we listen now to the message 
of the Lord
Father, I pray, Your way we'll follow.

Here I stand in need of You this 
day and this hour,
How can I, how can I go on Lord if 
You don't go before?
Here I am in this wilderness on my 
own,
I'm depending on Your Message 
Lord, alone to take me home.

As the prophet stood that day 
being out on his own,
Realizing that he could not find his 
way alone,
He had to give up even though he 
tried
To get out of the wilderness, he 
depended on the Guide.
Lead us on Lord, as we go through 
this trail;
To reveal Your Word Lord, You 
have not failed;
All those Messages You brought 
all along:
'The Real Gift Of God,'
'Burnt Offering,'
'On the Wings Of A Snow White 
Dove,'
Revealed 'Supernova,' 
Told us 'Consecrate,'
'Baptism Of Fire On The Eighth 
Day,'
'The Seals and Trumpets,' 
'Capstone Message Of Grace'
And The 'Inside Life With Christ,'
'Being Borne Away On Eagle's 
wings,'
'Restoration Revealed In The Four 
Stages,'
'The Greatest Battle,' 
'The Vials' and
'Deliverance Is At Hand.'
'Still Tied To My Absolute,'
'My Compass and My North Star,'
'Making Ready For a Paradox,'
'Be Not Afraid, Only Believe.'"
1187;UNDEFILED;G;"It's a world of compromise,
Standards have lowered, making 
lives
So devalued till all moral codes are 
lost,
But in the midst of all the sin
We have virtues that's within
God wants displayed, no matter 
what the cost.

CHORUS
Undefiled - real pure lives,
Walking holy and upright;
Keep that flag flying high
By living clean and undefiled.

And when we walk down the street,
All the people that we meet
Will see we can't be sold out cheap,
We're worth much more;
When the temptation's drawing 
near
Let's turn and run from the evil 
snare,
For our bodies are the temple of 
the Lord.

BRIDGE
Seem like our specie's fast 
becoming extinct,
Survival in earth's atmosphere 
gets harder everyday,
But the same God who saved our
souls
Is more than able to keep us whole,
And present us before Christ 
undefiled."
1188;SATAN IS DEFEATED;C;"Satan is defeated, 
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah.

Prison doors are open,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah.

Chains and shackles broken, 
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah.

Praise the Lord, we are free,
We have been delivered."
1189;JESUS IS ALL I HAVE;D;"From a world, a world of sin and 
shame, 
Jesus brought me out
And into the light I came;
Showed me truth so I'll not be 
deceived,
His word I believe,
Now I live to lift His name.

CHORUS
For Jesus is all,
He's all that I have to live for,
And even though His way seem 
hard sometimes
The end's eternal life,
So I live for Jesus Christ,
So I live for Jesus Christ.

I hold close the opportunity
That's been given me
To serve the Lord in my day;
Tell me what could be a greater 
privilege than to serve God in this 
age,
To walk in His provided way.

We can't live in a world of fantasy,
Of worldly thoughts and dreams,
They will fade away so fast;
But this truth, this word that sets 
us free, is the only reality,
It is the only thing that always shall 
last."
1190;MY GOD DELIVERED ME;D;"My God, my God, delivered me,
Lifted my burden, set me free,
That's the reason why I sing,
Praises to the coming King"
1191;JESUS BE THE RULER;D;"Jesus be the ruler of my life,
Let me be what you want me to be;
Jesus be the ruler of my life
So I can be a reflection of you."
1192;BEHOLD THE THIRD WOE;D;"The Kings of the earth and their 
armies
Are gathered in the valley of 
Meggido,
Where the grapes of God's wrath 
would be trampled,
The vats of blood will overflow;
So be not partakers my brothers
In Beltshazzar's drunken feast,
For his subjects are all deformed
Into the image of the Beast;
But stand like Daniel with your 
garments undefiled,
Knowing that Christ in you must be 
glorified. 

CHORUS
For behold the third woe cometh 
quickly,
It's an urgent cry,
Apply the token or die. 
For behold the third woe cometh 
quickly,
It's an urgent cry,
Apply the token or die.

Ecological crisis is filling men's 
heart with fear,
With the ozone layer being destroyed,
Divers earthquakes are everywhere;
But isn't it written in the scripture
The Heaven shall depart like a scroll
Thus saith the Lord
It's exactly what the prophets foretold;
But stand like Micaiah, stay with 
the seventh seal vision
You just say what Elijah already 
did say.

Now demons in the atmosphere
Are pressing their way into the 
hearts of men
Who are marked by God for their 
iniquity
In rejecting the prophet whom God 
has sent.
The slaughtering angels are ready
To slay the young and the old,
So watch the cares of this life,
Remember Lot's wife
Who for vanity lost her soul;
Stand like Rahab with your token 
on display,
For the destroying Angels are 
already on their way.

But stand like Daniel with your 
garments undefiled; 
Stand like Micaiah, stay with the 
seventh seal vision; 
Stand like Rahab with your token 
on display;
For the destroying Angels are 
already on their way."
1193;MARANATHA;F;"Men's heart are failing for fear,
Divers earthquakes everywhere,
It's a sign my friend, we are living 
in the end time.
The generation that sees the 
budding of the fig tree
Shall be the last one in the end 
time.
CHORUS
Maranatha, even now, come Lord 
Jesus
And take your waiting bride away, 
for we living in the end time;
Take your waiting bride away for we 
are living in the end time.

The scientists call the signs UFOs,
But they simply do not know 
They are investigation angels 
coming down in the end time;
Modern events that you and I see
Are made clear by vindicated
prophecy,
It's a sign, my friend, that we are
living in the end time.

A true prophet this generation has 
denied,
But His message was received by 
God's little bride, 
Hear His voice my friend, 
We are living in the end time;
One like unto to the Son of Man in 
a cloud showed His final sign,
Hear His voice, my friend, we are 
living in the end time.

The Spirit and the bride say come, 
For the day of mercy is almost done,
Hear His voice, my friend, we are 
living in the end time;
He that is filthy will be filthy still, 
So, my friend, be surrendered unto
God's will,
Hear His voice, my friend, 
We are living in the end time."
1194;LOOK AWAY TO JESUS;G;"Born to be a supersign in this great 
and final age,
When the whole world is falling 
apart again,
The prudent minds search for 
solutions,
Which we know they cannot find,
We know the answers lie
Beyond this dimension of time.

CHORUS
I'm looking away to Jesus,
He's the only way, sweet Jesus,
I'm looking away,
I'm looking away to Him.
Born to live in a super sense,
Far beyond what man can perceive.

The Word of God is what our 
hearts would only believe;
Looking to the unseen,
We see a brighter and better world,
So on the promises of God,
Is what we'd anchor our souls.

Born to overcome this wicked world
That Satan has deceived,
The promises of God is what we'd 
only believe;
His Word has power to transform
By the renewing of your mind;
To see the judgements of God,
We're at the end of time.

Born to be a super race, 
Abraham's royal seed.
Upon the bread of life is what we'd 
always feed;
Looking for a city whose maker 
and builder is God,
We know that soon we'll reign
With Jesus Christ our Lord."
1195;WHAT A BLESSING;C;"Oh, what a blessing to be saved,
Oh, what a blessing that the Lord 
has gave,
When I'm weak He makes me 
strong;
Let me know that I'm not alone;
Oh, what a blessing to be saved."
1196;CAN'T YOU HEAR;C;"A new day has dawned
And I know not what it brings,
But somehow I feel I'm almost 
home;
Not turning back to yesterday
But pressing towards my calling in 
Christ,
I can hear, yes I can hear my 
theophany calling me.

CHORUS
And can't you hear your theophany 
calling you?
It's a sign, it's almost home time,
And I'm just waiting for my 
promised body change,
For soon I know, we'll be with Him 
on high.

The whole earth is groaning and 
travailing in pain,
But we as the bride have been 
glorified in Him;
And saints, even though we may 
suffer,
Stand and gird your loins,
For your perfection it draweth near.

BRIDGE
My God knows overtime is drawing 
near,
And very soon the dead in Christ 
shall rise again;
There'll be no more sickness,
No more crying over there,
But for now, Christian Soldier,
Just keep on pressing."
1197;I'M NEARER HOME;F;"I'm nearer home than I was 
yesterday,
I'll walk with my Lord all along the 
way,
Each step I take, each prayer I pray,
I'm nearer home than I was 
yesterday."
1198;CHANGING ROBES;G;"Have faith don't worry now,
Everything is gonna be all right,
This mortal shall put on 
immortality;
We'll no longer be earth-bound,
But we'll be heaven-bound,
We'll slip from time into  eternity.
That's why....

CHORUS
I'm laying aside the old man,}
Putting on the new man,            }
I'm changing robes      }
For another dimension.          } 2x

I'm making all my wrongs right,
Got to have my lamp trimmed
And my fire burning bright;
You see I don't want no trouble
Down by the river,
I want to be ready to cross on 
 over.

I've heard the Bridegroom call,
And I've received my invitation;
This robe is so snowy white,
It fits me just right
Because it was furnished by the 
Bridegroom;
Now there's set before me
An open door to the wedding 
supper.

BRIDGE
The Shout was heard,
We're in the Voice now;
And very soon
The Trumpet shall sound!
Now I'm ascending into a higher 
order,
Far above all principalities and 
powers;
Far above corruption into
incorruption,
Far above mortal into immortality."

On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.

We at His feet may fall;
We'll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all;

Then he has become a new 
creation,
Old things are passed away,
Behold everything has become 
new in Him;

that brought you to this place 
before you came here,
He only sees you holy now, 
faultless and blameless as you're 
standing there.

CHORUS
Praise Him, lift your hands and 
praise Him,

Praise the Name of Jesus, 
Praise Him.

Through the blood of Jesus,
His righteousness is like a robe 
upon you,
His clothing, His covering,

Coming from the west, coming

He didn't have to save me but 
He did.

He didn't have to wake me, but 
He did,
He didn't have to wake me I'm 
glad He did
Don't you know He shook me 
until He woke and started me on 
my way,
He didn't have to do it but He did.

The Lord has been so good to me,
I can say the Lord has been so 
good to me, yeah.

Through all my trials, and when I 
failed Him
He didn't cast me away;
He stood right by me throughout 
my troubles,
And when I was lost He didn't let 
me go astray.

It was a great thing that He did 
for me,
It was a great thing when He set 
me free;

He took my sins, He saved my 
soul;
He filled me up and made me 
whole;
Jesus died on Calvary so the 
whole wide world could see
It was a great thing that He did

He's been my doctor,
He's been my lawyer,
He's never left me, He's been my 
friend;
He's been my comforter when I 
was lonely,
And when I was lost Jesus took 
me in.

About what I'm supposed to do,
I can't deny the times I've made 
 mistakes,
I can't hide from Him, He knew; 
But I knew that deep within my 
 soul
I felt sorry, honest I do,
So I just cried and said, ""Forgive 
me Lord,
Forgive me again, will you.""

CHORUS
Justified, Justified,
You have not done it in the first 
place, you're justified;
Justified, justified,
You have not done it in the first 
place, you're justified.

So often I'm discouraged
When I count the times I fall,
'Cause he promised I'd be 
victorious
When I know I'm not at all; 
Then I heard an eagle scream,
Its voice quickened my soul,
He said, ""you've not done it in the 
first place, you're justified.""

He looked at your perfect picture 
without blame, spot or wrinkle,
He didn't look at you from where 
you are now,
He looked from eternity,
He said you're just trapped in 
that body,
You bypassed your theophany;
You have not done it in the first 
place, you're justified."

Safe from all harm

me up,
How many times has He my 
burden borne,
How many times has He forgiven all 
my sins and when I reach those 
pearly gates,
When I reach those pearly gates,
When I reach those pearly gates,
When I reach those pearly gates,

He'll let me in."

For reapers to work for the Lord,
The harvest is ripe but the 
labourers are few,
And the Lord is calling on you;
Let's trim our lamps, be on fire 
for our Lord
For there's much work to be done,
The kingdom of God is at hand
And I will glorify my Lord.

CHORUS
Who will stand for the Lord?}2x
My lamp needs trimming my 
bowl has need of oil;
Who will stand for the Lord?

Your servant Lord, Nehemiah,
He laboured to rebuild the wall,
Sanbalat and Tobiah are trying 
to hinder Your cause,
Hear the prays of the saints, oh 
God, 
To see the Lord's true worship 
 restored;
The hornets have gone before us,
And the gospel must be preached.

Surely the land we've trodden 
under-foot
Will be our inheritance,
Be not afraid of giants no, no, no,
When we serve the Living God;
So who's this uncircumcised 
philistine from whom should such 
a man as I flee?
Just as my strength was then, So 
now is my strength for war."
1214;HEAVEN CAME DOWN;D;"Heaven came down and glory 
filled my soul
When on the cross Jesus made 
me whole;
My sins were washed away and 
my night turned today,
Heaven came down and glory

Putting my feet right under His 
table,
Knowing I'm never alone,
I'm feeling at home, 
I'm feeling at home. 

CHORUS
You could not have told me,
That I'll find what I've found,
Contentment and peace from 
above; 
Feeling at home in the presence 
of Jesus,
Laying way back in His love.

Warming myself by the fire of His 
Spirit,
Camping right close to His throne,

Feeling accepted and loved and

Lord I love to sing Your praises;
I'm so glad You're in my life,
I'm so glad You came to save me.

From the earth to the cross, His 
debt to pay,
From the cross to the grave, 
From the grave to the sky;
Lord I lift Your name on high."
1217;WASTED OPPORTUNITIES;F;"To think that men lived in a day
When the word of God was made 
flesh and dwelt on the earth;
But when the promise of the Holy 
Ghost was given, 
Only a few were prepared to 
receive it in their souls;
There were others, a great multitude,
But the precious seed that was 
sown, from their hearts Satan stole.

CHORUS
There are so many wasted 
opportunities,
Life has a way to get you relaxed 
and set you on your ease;
There are so many wasted 
opportunities,
People going after temporary needs 
which are only lying vanities.

History always repeats itself, this 
we all know,
For as it was, so shall it be,
The Bible tells us so.
The greatest event started with a 
shout,
But the veil was upon the hearts 
of many so they could not rejoice;
For the form of flesh God took to 
reveal Deity many could not receive,
So they stumbled at simplicity.

There was promised a second 
ride to catch away God's bride,
We were told to learn our A,B,C's,
And live humble and right in 
God's sight;
But as was promised the Lord 
did come as a thief in the night,
But only who have ears to hear 
and eyes to see saw Him en 
morphe."

He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, power and love,

1219;EL SHADDAI;C;"In the Bible long ago there's a 
story that we all should know,
Of Abraham, Sarah, Ishmael and 
Hagar,
And the promise God gave by 
word to Abraham which he had 
heard;
But tried to bring it forth in his 
own way.

BRIDGE
But, oh Breasted, One we nurse 
from you,
You are the One to see us through;
No more would we walk in our 
own way,
So we lift our hands and give you 
praise.

CHORUS
El Shaddai, El Shaddai,       }
All that's left for me now is }
just to nurse from You.       }2x 
By taking heed to what his wife 
did say,
What a mistake he did make, the 
path of reasoning he did take;
Produced a wild man till this day,
Contrary to God's great plan of 
redemption He has made 
towards man.

MONOLOGUE
For then one day the Lord did 
come and changed his name 
from Abram to Abraham.
He revealed the breast to him,
To give him strength to walk 
again,
When He said "" I am the 
Almighty; walk before Me and 
be thou perfect, and I'll give 
you strength, (which is His 
Dunamis)
To overcome the tempest"
1220;BE THOU STRONG;D;"The battle is almost over, 
The victory is almost won;
The Captain of hosts is here to 
lead the way, and these are the 
words we hear Him say.

CHORUS
Be thou strong and be thou 
courageous,
Be not afraid of the enemy around,
For I'm the One that will fight for 
you;
Be thou strong and be thou 
courageous,
For the victory is yours to be won.

Be strong in the Lord and the 
power of His might,
Believe His word and don't doubt;
For by His word you shall 
conquer your enemy,
And by His word you have 
victory.

There is no enemy that could 
stand before you,
As long as I am with you;
Be not afraid nor be dismayed,
For I will not fail nor forsake you.

the outside,
Oh, what a change in my life!
Jesus on the inside, working on

This rock is Jesus, yes, He's the 
One,
This rock is Jesus, the only One;
Be very sure, be very sure, 
Your anchor holds and grips the

In times like these you need the 
Bible,
In times like these, O, be not idle; 
Be very sure, be very sure,

I'm glad, for my hope's in the Lord."
1224;I'M GOING THROUGH;F;"I'm going through, yes, I'm going 
through,
I'll pay the price whatever others

I'll take the way of the Lord's 
despised few,
I'm going through, Jesus, I'm 
going through."
1225;BIRTH PAINS;F;"Oh God, You're my God, early 
will I seek Thee,
My soul thirsteth for Thee;
My flesh longeth for Thee in a 
dry and thirsty land
Where no water is, 
but I know I'll find Thee;
For all of my life 
There's been this deep and 
inward hunger
To see my Saviour,
And if I don't see You, Lord, 
I just don't know what I will do,
For You're the only one to see 
me through.

CHORUS
Oh, I'm travailing in birth 
And pain to be delivered,
Travailing in birth and pain to be 
delivered;
Oh, I'm travailing in birth
And pain to be delivered,
To manifest the living Christ,
Oh, I'm travailing in birth
And pain to be delivered.

To see Thy power and Thy glory,
So as I have seen Thee in the 
sanctuary;
Thy loving-kindness is better 
than life,
My lips shall praise Thee all of 
my life;
You've put this deep within me
So that I will thirst for Thee,
You've placed this desire within 
my soul;
My soul followeth hard after Thee,
Thy right hand upholdeth me.

There appeared a great wonder 
in Heaven,
A woman clothed with the sun
Standing on the moon,
And upon her head a crown of 
twelve stars,
And before her stood a dragon;
But when the enemy 
comes in like a flood
My God will always lift a 
standard,
For no weapon formed against me
shall ever prosper,
And every tongue that rises
I will condemn forever."
1226;IT'S ME, IT'S ME;C;"I am waiting for that moment,
I am waiting for that day,
I am waiting for the fullness
To burst this flesh away.

CHORUS
Before me lay
The mirror of the word,
One time it showed a dark 
reflection,
It drew me closer from face to 
face,
It's me, It's me, that's the 
Revelation

Lord You made to me a promise
That You'll live Your life in me;
Tho the vision seems to tarry,
Lord I'll wait till it manifests in 
me.

It's for me, the great outpouring
Before the rapture of the bride;
It's been worked in a small 
measure,
It will take me to the sky"

Hold on, saints, hold on,
Keep on walking in the footsteps of 
the Lord;
Hold on, saints, be strong,
Walk in confidence and faith,
God will take us to that city where 
we belong.

Though the world is against us we 
could never be deceived, 
If we are walking in the footsteps of 
the Lord;
And like Joshua and Caleb keep on 
claiming your mountain,
And never compromise the word of 
God;
And although your bodies might get 
weaker every day,
Never let your testimonies 
ever be taken away.
Just hold on……

We know just what the devil's gonna 
do before he realizes,
God uncovers his every scheme to 
show us his ways;
How he tries to enter our minds to 
deceive us with lust and lies
But we are justified and we are 
sanctified,
And there'll be no compromise;
God is saying to His bride, ""Speak 
the word!""
So keep on your armour, you're 
heading towards the third pull.
Just hold on……

The world will try to crucify the word 
that is growing in us,
Those who are walking in the 
footsteps of the Lord;
But those who place values on the 
word could never be shaken,
And would never compromise the 
word of God;
We have seen so many fall from the 
word, 
So let's keep our eyes on the prize 
and turn away from the world.
Just hold on……"
1230;COMFORT OF MY SOUL;C;"When I remembered the time I 
was so low in sin,
Dear Jesus You came and 
showed me your grace;
Now no one can ever take me

And now I could never be the 
same
For now I live only for you by 
your grace.

Jesus is my truest friend that I 
could ever lean on,
He can be trusted and his word

Sometimes I get weary and can't 
go on,

such love,
All I have I surrender to you."

1232;LOOK WHAT HE'S MADE;A;"A lonely manger, a humble God
The King of heaven came down 
to fallen earth;
Despised, rejected, 
Disdained by men,
Oh, this child was born
To save men from their sins.

An undefiled and a spotless Lamb,
He gave himself up 
as the final sacrifice,
But on the third day 
rose from the grave
Fulfilling that which 
all the scriptures have said;

And now He lives 
to give us of His life,
And now He reigns 
to lift us up on high.

CHORUS
Look what He's made out of nothing,
Look what He's formed out of clay,
Look what He gave to a world 
that was dying,
Look what He's done through His 
grace!
Think back to the night when He 
found you,
Consider the love that He gave
Remember the love and the 
peace that He's shown you,
Look what He's done through His 
grace!
Oh, look what He's done through 
His grace!

A broken vessel, a wayward heart,
Not a likely place 
for His kingdom to start,
The great Redeemer, 
Saviour of men 
Oh, my Father came down and 
brought me home again.

And now I live 
to thank him for His faith,
And here I stand singing of His grace.
You don't have to look very far
To find evidence of amazing grace,
You don't have to search very far
To see what God can do,
For He's remained so faithful,
For He's remained so true."
1233;A PRISONER OF LOVE …;G;"My life is no longer mine
I'm bought with a price 
So therefore I must glorify Him at 
the cross
Bought not with corruptible things 
As silver or gold
But by the precious blood of the 
lamb
That redeemed my soul
And now I'm in Him and He in me
With His bride He'll reign for all 
eternity
That's why….

CHORUS
I'm learning to be a prisoner of 
love divine (repeat)
As I walk in his bloody footprints
In the sands of time
I'm learning to be a prisoner of 
love divine

My body is the temple of the 
Holy Ghost
And He's my comforter and 
teacher of the cross
Now I'm laying aside every 
weight 
That easily beset me
And looking to the author of my 
destiny
And the finisher of my faith
I know he will mould me
Till my faith is perfected

For if we be dead with Him
We shall also live with Him
If we suffer with Him
We shall also reign
So therefore endure hardness as 
a good solider
And be not entangled with the affairs 
Of this life 
That you may please him who 
hath chosen you
To be a good soldier"

beyond compare,
They talk of streets of gold
Where we'll never grow old,
No it won't be long,
We'll be going home,

No more tears to dim the eye.

Saints would laugh and sing,
Joyful praises ring,
No it won't be long, we'll be 
going home,

roll is called,
I want to see the saints of old

Don't you want to go where we'll 
never say goodbye,
There'll be no loneliness, no 
more tears to dim the eyes.

There'll be mansions there far 
beyond compare,
They talk of streets of gold
Where we'll never grow old;
We'll see him on His throne, He'll 
say welcome home,
I want to go."

fire cannot burn me,

In your presence, oh Lord, my God;
In your presence, 
that's where I belong,
Seeking your face,
Touching your grace,
In the cleft of the rock,
In your presence, oh God.

I want to hide where the flood of 
evil cannot reach me,
Where I'm covered by the blood;
I want to be where the schemes 
of darkness cannot touch me,
In your presence, oh God."
1236;YES LORD, YES LORD;F;"I'll say yes, Lord, yes;
To your will and to your word,
I'll say yes, Lord, yes,
I will trust you and obey,
When your spirit speaks to me,
With my whole heart I'll agree 
And my answer will be, 
Yes, Lord, yes.

Yes Lord, yes Lord,
From the bottom of my heart to 
depths of my soul;
Yes Lord, completely yes,

1237;SUPERNOVA;C;"I was stumbling around in 
amnesia,
Not knowing the purpose for 
which I was born,
By destiny, I heard the words of 
Elijah,

was born;
Born again, my heart has been 
turned back,
Faith of my Father is now in my soul.

CHORUS
And now I know…
I was born to be a supernova,
A shining star in this hour;
I was born to be a Supernova
I was born to be a supernova,
Reflecting God's light and His power.

As a child Satan sought me to 
devour,
But my life was always protected 
by an unseen power;
Greater was He that's in me than 
the white horse rider,
As my eagle wings of faith grew 
stronger and stronger;
Now I'm risen far above the 
powers of deception,
I have mounted the heavenly 
currents by revelation.

From darkness I've been lifted to 
heavenly places,
Amazing grace has taken me 
from unrighteousness;
Born a star, I do delight in His glory,
But what of my people who yet 
stumble in iniquity;
Now in position, set in my course,
I'll reflect a light beam in their way,
Oh, let the risen Son turn their 
darkness into day.

Queen Esther, your light is 
becoming brighter,
Not many days now, you'll 
display the King's power;
Rise and shine, oh let your light 
shine in this hour,
Let this wicked world be shaken 
by a supernova.

Out there I was in Egypt land, God 
called me out by his command,
The way he did with Abraham.

We're going back to the faith where 
we'll die for eternal life;
We're going back to the faith, 
into the garden of Eden,
Where we know we were 
predestinated before the 
foundation of the world to walk 
by faith.

This is the age of Laodicea, 
where men and women fight for 
their rights, for their rights
False doctrine and creeds feel 
welcome in this world,
For this is the age Satan sits on 
his throne, on his throne;
This is the age where Jezebel and 
her harlots celebrate,
Where many are drunken from 
her wine;
And this is the age where the 
mysteries go back to the East,
Saints this is the end of the 
Gentiles' time, make sure you 
don't get left behind.

Millions of unclean spirits are

Searching for a place, 
An inhabitant to dwell, 
To spit those issues out;
But like Joseph who knew 
that famine will come, 
Prepared, so the people won't 
die,
God sent Elisha 
with the hidden manna, 
Food He had stored for a bride, 
A bride who will stand……

For the covenanted people
God sent regulations,
What we should and should not 
eat;
No Devil can beguile us,
No serpent can defile us,
We'll remain healthy and clean
And every storm brings us 
closer,
It anchors our soul to that rock;
God will never leave us, 
But He must chastise us 
To prove we are born of the 
word.
And we'll stand……."

Breakdown my walls of unbelief
And make my spirit stronger.

I'll overcome them day by day;
Let my spirit build on solid ground
So I will not be shaken.

Humble my spirit, holy Father,
Make me obedient to thy word;
Apply your holy word in my life

How many times I bow beneath

On bended knees to God a 
prayer I pray
As I knelt there on the floor,
He reminds me just once more

Brothers and sisters we stand as

Here we are gathered, like the

The ground was tilled, the seed 
was sown,
And it was ripened by the Son
Now it's harvest time, let's work 
together for what must be done
Standing in unity, standing in love.

Just like Moses, when he led the 
children to the Promised Land,
The cloud led by day, the pillar of 
fire by night
As they marched as one from 
Egypt's land
And when this bride is perfected, 
we will all meet in the new 
Jerusalem,
We'll be standing in unity, we'll 
be standing as one.

hungry world to bring them in,
This is our joy (this is our hope, this is 
our life)
It's our survival,
Let's pray for a Holy Ghost arrival
Let's have a revival.

Sometimes we just gone thru the 
motion,
Left the Spirit out,
No power in our program,
No victory in our shout;
But God will give us back the joy
Let's open up the Bible, lay aside 
formality,
Let's have a revival.

Well I ask a old time preacher
How revival came back there,
He said we always started down 
on our knees in prayer
Just open up those two books,
The songbook and the Bible,
If you sing and preach God's 
word you'll have a revival."

1257;COME HOLY SPIRIT;C;"The Holy Spirit came at Pentecost
He came in mighty fullness then
His witness through believers won 
the lost
As multitudes were born again
The early Christians scattered o'er 
the world
They preached the gospel fearlessly
Though some were martyred and to 
lions hurled
They marched along in victory.
CHORUS
Come Holy Spirit dark is the hour
We need your filling your love 
and your mighty power
Move now among us, stir us we pray
Come Holy spirit revive your 
church today

Then in an age when darkness 
grip the earth
The just shall live by faith was 
learnt
The Holy Spirit gave the church 
new birth as reformation fires burn
In later years the great revival came
When saints would seek the Lord 
and pray
Oh, once again we need that 
Holy flame
To meet the challenge here today."

Fastened to the rock which

Grounded firm and deep in the 
Saviour's love

Will your anchor hold in the 
straits of fear
When the breakers roar and the 
reef is near
While the surges rave and the 
wild winds blow
Shall the angry waves then your 
bank overflow

Will your anchor hold in the

When the waters cold chill your

On the rising tide you can never 
fail
While your anchor holds, within

Will you anchor safe by the

Will life's storms are past forever

With planks on bricks for benches 
and a pulpit made of pan
Till we move up to the house at 
Simpson Brown,
To give witness at the place 
where God took us from
Then amidst the voice of those 
who lived near
A building was erected and we 
worship God there

Well, the work was truly growing 
And the time came we move up 
to the place of the burning flame
To unite with saints who were to 
be a part of this great work that 
God did start
Well, mighty revelations 
thundered from that place
And around the world it went with 
shouting of grace

Our God is a Father he cares for 
old and young
And He has given this place for 
our little ones
As prisoners we stand right on 
this spot
We know its a transformation 
from what it was
Though tillers of the soil are all 
around
There still an Abel in our midst 
with a bloody Lamb

It seem we were set and just 
ready to go
But more of God's great plan 
began to unfold
The saints from deep in south 
Has come to take their place 
amongst now
And as we wait, we wait right here
We are just waiting to be caught up, 
caught up in the air."

But be determined to complete
For thy mountains shall become 
a plain [Zerubabel]

Him
Jerusalem shall stand complete

1320;I GIVE YOU JESUS;C;"If the ship of your life
Is tossed and on the sea of strife
You need someone
If you feel so all alone
That your house is not a home
You need someone
If you feel life isn't fair
And there's no one left to share
All your lonely days and night
When things won't turn out right
And you want someone to share
And someone to just be there
You need someone

CHORUS
I give you Jesus
He's the peace that passeth all 
understanding
I give you Jesus He's the perfect 
love that casteth out all fear
I give you Jesus He's the water

You'll never thirst again
I give you Jesus my friend 
I give you Jesus

If the pressures all around
Keeps your spirits to the ground
You need someone
If your body is in pain
And your health you can't regain
You need someone
If there are times when you have 
tried
With all the strength you have inside
And it seems that you have failed 
Remember on the cross He nailed
All your bitterness and grief
To bring you peace and sweet 
relief
For He's someone"
1321;I KNOW;C;"Job was on his ash heap
His afflictions and trials strong
His health, his wealth, his family
Everything he had was gone
But as he looked out unto the 
mountains
And the lilies out in the fields
The Prophet said Job caught a 
vision of the Seventh Seal

CHORUS
Job said I know that my 
Redeemer lives
He'll stand in the later day
Though the worms may eat this 
body
I'll rise again some day
For as a grain of wheat falls to 
the ground
It withers and it dies
At Easter time it springs again
Bringing forth new life

Noah built the ark and did
Exactly as God had said
But it seemed like time would 
prove him wrong
He preached a hundred and 
twenty years
But as the sky grew dark and the 
winds blew strong
And the rain came falling down
I can hear old Noah rejoice and 
sing
That happy Easter song

CHORUS
He said I know that my 
Redeemer lives
The ark will rest some day
Though around me wave and 
billows roll
And all life will pass away
As a grain of wheat falls to the 
ground
It withers and it dies
At Easter time it springs again
Bringing forth new life

Jesus walked the lonely road
That led to Calvary
He looked so very defeated
As He hung there on the tree
But He said,
no man can take my life
I freely lay it down
Yes there had to be a Calvary
For an Easter time to come

CHORUS
Yes, I know that my Redeemer lives
He'll take me home some day
Through the storms of life
The toils and strife
I will praise Him anyway
For as a grain of wheat falls to 
the ground
It withers and it dies
At Easter time He rose again
To give us back His life"
1322;IT MAKES ME SHOUT;G;"When I think about the Lord
How He saved me
How He raised me
How He filled me with the Holy 
Ghost
How He healed me to the uttermost
When I think about the Lord
How He picked me up and 
turned me around
How He placed my feet on solid 
Ground

It makes me want to shout 
Hallelujah
Thank you Jesus
Lord you are worthy of all the glory

1323;SHALOM, SHALOM;C;"The voice of the false anointed 
is speaking

Shalom, Shalom, 
it's the dawning of a new day
Shalom, Shalom,

The Seventh Dove has come 
saying Shalom

While all around us is dying
Their ears heeded to lies
We've received God's true teaching
And now our safety's in Christ

To us who are shut up in safety
Who've always looked up above

From the mouth of That Seventh

1325;I'M RUNNING;G;"Satan is mad but I'm so glad
Cause he lost a soul that he

I'm running, I'm running
My running days will soon be over
I'm running, I've got to get in a 
hurry
I know I'm gonna make it to the

One of these days it won't be

You're going to look for me, but 
I'll be gone
When I get to heaven shall I look 
for you
If you want to get there you 
better run too

One of these days down here in 
Babylon
We're going to see the saints

One of these mornings in the 
twinkling of an eye
I'm going to leave to be with my

1327;RISE AND SHINE;C;"We lived our past in pleasure
Realizing never hidden treasures 
in our soul
That gene of God that is placed 
within
And at the time appointed we 
were anointed 
To believe this present Word
The only evidence that His life is 
within
Now justified we are free from sin

CHORUS
We were born to rise and shine 
For the Lord has come
We'll rise and shine 
We were made to overcome
We'll rise and shine
Like the stars above

By holding the vision before 
every decision that's how we 
overcome
The Lord is having then the 
preeminence
We'll trust Him ever and doubt 
Him never
All the promises He has made
Realizing there is no need to be 
afraid
For His word can never fail

We'll suffer affliction by this 
confession the scripture has 
foretold
We consider our trials more 
precious than gold
Leaving these worldly pleasures 
far behind for greater riches we 
must now claim
Never mind the reproaches you 
bear for His name for God's 
children won't be ashamed

Amidst this world's frustration we 
have restoration
The earnest of the Promise Land 
only be thou courageous and 
strong
We have the hidden manna six 
barley measures 
We're awaiting that final one
Our Lord won't rest till his work 
is done
We'll have the fullness of the sun

We're made superhuman 
over every condition 
by the power of His word
Holding our confession unto the 
end
And by His election we'll change 
dimensions to a world that's so 
sublime
No more to be mortal creatures 
of time
There forever we shall shine"

sins I've died

the backsliders too
If you need deliverance He'll do it 
for you
He died on the cross but now 
He's alive

sins He died

He's calling for the sick and He's 
calling for the lame
If you don't be healed then He's 
not to blame
For He died on the cross but now 
He's alive
And He rose to tell you for your 
pain He died

He's calling for the motherless 
and the fatherless too

He's alive
And He rose to tell you for your 
joy He died"

The mystery of who I really am

names in the scripture
Shows Almighty God is our Father

By which Jesus Christ has made 
us free
No longer would we stay in 
bondage

can return
For all that Adam lost has been 
restored
Fellowship, full dominion, power 
over all creation
Because the Trumpet's sounding

A message that called us out
From this world of fear and doubt
And have been given eyes to see
All the mysteries are being revealed
Our lives are fulfilling prophecy
To see our position in God's word
To fly where only eagles could

We are not called to be earthbound
Amidst the chipmunks on the ground

Setting in the cleft of the rock
Gathered where the carcass is

O Lord I hunger for more of you
Rise up within me
Let me know your truth
O Holy Spirit saturate my soul
And let the life of God fill me now
Let your healing power revive 
and make me whole
And let the peace of God let it reign

O Holy Spirit you're my comfort 
Strengthen me hold my hand up high
As I stand upon your truth
Singing glory unto you 
And let the peace of God let it

1351;WE NEED THE RAIN;D;"Lord you said if I humble myself
Pray, seek your face, turn from 
my wicked ways
You'll hear from heaven and 
forgive my sins
And in love and mercy, you'll 
send the rain
To heal the Land, send the Holy 
Ghost
Heal the land, send the Holy Ghost

Lord you planted your Word in me
In the form of messages
You sowed the seed 
Now I'm asking for the Holy Ghost
To come, live in me
And bring forth fruit unto thee
Send the rain, send the Holy Spirit
Water your garden, send the 
Holy Ghost

You removed the enmity
Between my soul and you at Calvary
Giving me access to your throne
That in my time of need
I'll make my desire known
For the rain, send the Holy Ghost
For the rain, send the Holy Ghost

I want to see Jesus in me
Overcoming daily and constantly
Putting my enemies beneath my 
feet
And giving me dominion and full 
authority
Send the rain, send the Holy Ghost
In this hour of battle, send the 
Holy Ghost
Pour out your spirit, send the 
Holy Ghost

In the time of battle 
Send the Holy Ghost
Send down your showers 
Send the Holy Ghost
And take us higher

1352;I WILL RESTORE;D;"Bride, do you remember
Way back to your former rain
When you once stood in position
Having dominion and all things 
under your feet
But you fell, you fell from that 
fellowship
And you wondered where you 
went wrong
So you cry out, you thirst for that 
latter rain
And you'll fight for that power again.

You see the palmerworm, 
came in your life and ate
Then the cankerworm 
came in your life and ate
Then the caterpillar and locust 
ate
But God promised, 
Yes he promised

CHORUS
That I will restore saith the Lord (2x)
Jehovah promised a Holy Ghost 
promise 
I will restore thus saith the Lord (2x)

Power shall come from on high
After the Holy Ghost comes upon 
you
You shall be witness unto me 
throughout the world
My glory all men shall behold
For I shall come unto you as the 
former rain
As the latter rain to you shall I come
And all men shall know.
That you have the evidence
That Jesus rose from the dead
And in your own atmosphere
God will visit you there
For you were meant to be mighty 
men of valour and He promised"
1353;IF YOU CAN USE ANYTHING;C;"If you can use anything Lord  }
You can use me       }2x
Take my hands and my feet
Touch my heart Lord 
Speak through me
If you can use anything Lord 
You can use me"
1354;STILL TIED TO MY ABSOLUTE;C;"A mighty man of valour
You faced your enemy
And with the sword you've 
slaughtered
You had sweet victory
But it gets bitter
When you're tried in the fire
And it get hard sometimes 
But pleasing to the soul
Yet if you choose to leave your place
Who will stand instead 
For this cause were you chosen
To see that devil dead
So keep on fighting
Fighting with all the faith
Keep looking towards the vision
For the hour now is late

CHORUS
So I'll put on the armour of God
I'll put on the shield of faith
Trusting in the sword of the spirit
Pray with sincerity and truth 
For we wrestle not against flesh 
and blood
But principalities and powers
And rulers of darkness
And here I stand in truth
Still tied to my absolute.

I've read it in the Bible 
Joshua 5:14
God came down as Lord of Hosts
Israel was defended and 
positioned
And David slew the lion
Looked back to his experiences
And then he smote Goliath
And I am of that pedigree
Why should I run and fear 
I'll speak the word with revelation
I will not surrender till I walk upon
The ashes of that wicked one 
Till I stand face to face
With the one who kept me by his 
grace."
1355;IT'S A HONOUR;C;"It's an honour to serve, 
to join in the fight
I will lift up my voice
I will lay down my life 
Giving glory to God, 
seeking none in return
It's an honour, an honour to serve

We are called by the Name 
Of The Third Exodus
We will not be ashamed 
For our God is with us
We obey our calling, 
Stand in rank and in file
It's an honour, an honour to serve

Of One Body, One Spirit
One Lord and One Faith
Of hearts joined in praise 
And One love, unfeigned
Working together for this great 
cause
It's an honour, an honour to serve

There's a Pastor, and Ministers
And helpers true
Deacons and Trustees
And Song Leaders too

presence give him all the praise 
Give unto God all the glory due

1359;SOMETHING IS BREAKING;D;"CHORUS
Something is breaking 
Between mortal and immortal
The Son's coming up 
Removing the darkness of night
The key's being given 
Opening dimensions
Life and immortality 
Is coming to light

A seal breaks open 
A man caught a vision
Heard the voice of a prophet 
saying ""sail on, sail on""
And just like Abraham 
He's in search of another land
The unseen is now being made 
visible
As dove leads eagle

When crisis arises 
The world gets in birth pains
They see the need to move forward
Then the anointing 
Falls upon the vessel 
Who has been ordained
To lift us up on a higher plane

Through each unfolding 
The way is opening
Spiritual scientists working by 
laws to achieve this rapturing faith
Thru secret passages 
Seven steps up the pyramid
Where we'll run through death
Leap over into supernatural 
Realms

Something is breaking 
Between mortal and immortal
The Son's coming up 
Removing the darkness of night
After this mountain,
eternity sets in
That's the real world 
We're gonna live in"
1360;DO YOU KNOW YOUR GOD…;C;"You doubt when you should 
speak the Word
When you should overcome
You eat of all the other foods
I've warned you not to eat from
And when you see your nakedness
You turn and walk away
When you should be on bended 
knees
That I could hear you when you 
Pray

CHORUS
Do you know your God in you
Then why do you doubt my words
When you know I can do
Do you know your God in you
To overcome this evil world
You have to know the God in you

When you look back to Calvary
What do you see
When you underestimate my 
words and my simplicity
And when the trials come your way
Why do you doubt my words
When greater is the God in you than 
he who is in the world

I predestinated you to manifest 
my word
Revealed my secrets unto you
But still you doubt my word
Raise above your unbelief
Put on your royal armour
Pray for revelation
You have to know your God

CHORUS
Do you know your God in you
Why do you doubt my word
When you see what I can do
Do you know your God in you
To overcome this evil world
Do you know the God you serve"
1361;APPLY THE FAITH;Am;"What you've got locked up deep 
inside
God's gene placed there for this 
final ride
You have the faith for your victory
You can move mountains if you'll 
only believe
If you are living in captivity
And there seems to be no way out
my friend, 
God's word has set you free

CHORUS
Apply the faith that God has
given you
You don't have to be defeated
God's word will see you through
Stand and proclaim in Jesus Name
Your promised inheritance
So if the enemy still comes in like 
a flood
Tell him your sins they are all 
under the blood


Now we're no longer under the law
No longer in the enemy's claw
For the faith came so we could 
be justified
For all of our sins Christ was 
crucified
For we have the key to all the 
enemy's schemes
Seven seals have been revealed
Now stand and proclaim your liberty"
1362;HE ALONE IS WORTHY;F;"He alone is worthy
To worship and adore
The lamb of God victorious
My risen Lord
He purchased my redemption
My righteousness is he
Exalt the name of Jesus
He is worthy"
1363;GREAT IS THE LORD;A;"Great is the Lord
Who ordained my every trial 
That I stand faithful in the midst 
of circumstances
Great is the Lord who has 
proven by His dying
He has redeemed and He has 
restored all things
When I am weak, my God is strong 
He causes me to walk into a faith 
I've never known 
And lifts me higher
He unlocked the door of faith 
And anoints my soul for a 
rapturing condition
Great is the Lord who has restored
My atonement at Calvary 
brought me perfect faith (2x)

He lifts me higher unlocked the 
door of faith

earth ( We get lifted higher)
And now we know him through

Into realm of perfect faith
We get lifted higher (he unlocked

soul for rapturing condition)
Great is the Lord
Who has restored the cloud on 
Sunset mountain brought me 
perfect faith(2x)"
1364;IT TAKES A SACRIFICE;Cm;"Our prophet said God's church 
will write another book of Acts
As fast as the Word is being preached
Those scriptures come to pass
So God anoints a people
With a burden in their soul
To see this message go far and wide 
And spread throughout the world
But the devil's always fighting God
So there has to be a praying church
To fight with the two edge sword

CHORUS
It takes a sacrifice
To see God's word
A sacrifice
Spread throughout the world
A sacrifice
To see this Message reach to 
the hearts of men

In the days of the Ephesian 
church
In Paul's ministry, when the church 
knelt down to pray for Paul
Those demons had to flee
Therefore in this age the Bride 
Age
So we ought to be
There has to be a church of God 
fulfilling her ministry
And though demons stand 
against us causing accidents and 
pains
How far are you willing to stoop 
for God to see his word fulfilled

Many saints of the past church ages 
Sacrificed their lives
And although the messengers 
were killed 
The Message stayed alive
So God give us this full Word 
And responsibility to eat the book 
And prophesy and set the 
captive free
So the battle must keep raging
It gets bloody as can be
But as soldiers in God's army
We already have the victory"
1365;PRESENT YOUR BODY AS…;C;"CHORUS
Present your body as a living 
sacrifice
It's your reasonable service
For you've been bought with a 
Price

The precious blood of Jesus
Of the sinless spotless Lamb
Shed for you and I fallen man
How He loved us with a love
Even before this world began
Considered you and I 
In his redemption plan
How we should love him
And be prisoners of his word
Bound by the chains
Of love divine

The whole creation groaneth 
And travaileth until now
For the manifestation of the sons 
of God
He's rent the veil of vain tradition
Brought his image in plain view
Now veils his glory
In oddballs like me and you
Now we despise Satan's Eden
Die to ourselves day by day
Perfect faith is the victory
We must attain

Monologue
 Romans 8:35-39
A servant at suppertime
Came with the secrets
In God's mind
Proclaimed our liberty
Bringing many sons to glory
How we tore our filthy rags
In exchange for robes so clean 
and white
To sit in God's presence
Taking our place in His plan
How we should be thankful
He has chosen you and me
We are the reason of His death 
We are his victory"
1366;IT'S NOT IN TRYING BUT…;F;"Sometimes life seems like words 
and music
That can't become a song
And we cry and sigh and we try 
again and wonder
What could be wrong
And when we turn to the Lord
At the end of ourselves like 
we've done at times or before
We'll find hid truth is the same as 
it always been
We never will need more

CHORUS
It's not in trying but in trusting
It's not in running but in resting
It's not in wondering but in praying
That we find the strength of the 
Lord

He's all we need for our every 
need
He'll never leave thee alone
But the last move that we choose
To do to live a life on our own
But the only good that could ever 
be said
Is the pain we find ourselves in
Yet there are places to gain the 
wisdom 
To say I'll never leave him again"
1367;WE GIVE THANKS;C;"We thank you Lord 
For the love You gave so free
The sacrifice of Calvary
We thank you Lord
And our lips will praise You 
always
With all our hearts we bring to 
You
Our sacrifice of praise
And may our lives reflect Your 
light
And be Your temple all our days
We thank You Lord
And we live to serve You always."
1368;EXCEPT THE LORD GOD…;C;"CHORUS
Except the Lord God build this 
house
Then our labours are in vain
Except the Lord God keepeth 
this city
Then the watchman waketh up in 
vain
For what house will you build the 
Lord
Since he dwelleth not in temple 
made of human hands
But by his grace 
He made you his habitation
The Lord has built this house.

God has promised in this day
There'll be a people like him
They are chosen forth to bring 
Messiah
God manifest in flesh again
A people  whom he has 
redeemed by his blood
By his prophet's voice, we've 
been called out
To be his tabernacle
That he himself will dwell in

He is our foundation
The chief and corner stone
The great, wise Master builder
Building His masterpiece to be 
like Him
And we are the lively stones of 
this house 
His workmanship unto good 
works
Glorifying our Father
God and us are now one.

Our hands are your hands 
Our feet are your feet
Filled with your Holy Spirit
Now we are co workers with you
And with your word you lead us 
throughout the earth
To hunt out the missing stones that 
will build up this house
Lord now your house is complete.

BRIDGE
We will walk like him
We will talk like him for (for the Lord 
God is in this house)
The sick shall be healed the dead 
shall be raise because (for the Lord 
God is in this house)
Great works shall you do for His 
spirit dwells within you (for the Lord 
God is in this house)
A third pull ministry we'll have for 
God's word within us (for the Lord 
God is in this house)
Edenic beauty we put again, his 
glory fills us 
The Lord is in this house
From faith to perfect love we'll 
stand in His Image."
1369;THE POWER OF YOUR LOVE;G;"Lord I come to you

Flowing from the grace that I've 
found in you

Will be swept away by the power 
of your love

CHORUS
Hold me close let your love 
surround me
Bring me near draw me to your side
And as I wait I rise up as the eagle
And I will soar with you as your 
Spirit leads me on
In the power of your love

Lord unveil my eyes 
Let me see you face to face
The knowledge of your love as 
you live in me
Lord renew my mind as your will 
unfold in my life
Living everyday by the power of 
your love."
1370;FAITH TO BELIEVE;D;"Cast out all fears and doubts
He surely bring you out
Of your condition, whatever it 
may be
Stay I his provided way
For the price he did pay
Only in that place you'll come into
Rapturing grace

He has given me the faith to believe 
For whatever you ask you shall 
receive
For he's given me the key
For my victory
Believing on him who's been 
sent to me
I need not worry 
My soul is now at peace

For he has given me the faith to 
believe
For whatever I ask I shall receive
He told me come boldly before 
his throne
For I am his own
Believing what he said 
concerning me
Brings my heart a settled peace
So I need not worry
My soul is now at peace."
1371;TO WHERE I BELONG;F;"Take me out of the shallow waters
I can't stand on my own
Bear me over the deepest fountain
By trusting you alone
If holding you is a weakness Lord
Don't let me be so strong
Take me out of the shallow waters
Lord
To where I belong"
1372;TIRED LABOURING IN THE…;Dm;"From the moment I believed, 
I've been labouring in the flesh 
and I will keep believing 
till his promise I receive, 
I will never be satisfied 'till in his 
likeness I awake. 
And I will never cease to cry 
until Christ and I unite just like 
Ruth who ceased to labour 
then came into her perfect rest.

CHORUS
I'm tired of labouring in the flesh
I'm coming into His rest, 
That's where I'll cease from all 
unbelief 
Christ living in me will be my peace. 
I'm tired of labouring in the flesh 
I'm coming into his rest 
That's where I'll cease from all 
unbelief 
Christ living in me will be my peace.

I have learnt in this body there is 
a law of sin and that evil is 
present with me even when I will 
to do good. 
But God promised in this hour 
He said there will be a change 
there'll be a total annihilation, 
an irreversible change. 
Just like Paul who had learnt 
there's no condemnation 
to those who are Christ.

MONOLOGUE
I'm so tired of trying to live his life 
and how could I live his life if I'm still 
living mine. 
And though I know from the bottom 
of my heart that I'm not from this 
world 
Yet there is nothing I can do in 
myself to return to that place of 
perfect peace. 
He said he will come and he will not 
tarry so I will not draw back and I will 
not be loose about my life anymore
The only labour I must labour is to 
enter into his rest."

On the earth I'll be a pilgrim
On my way to glory there's so 
much pain I must endure
I'll fight the good fight, I'll keep 
the faith
I'm forward to glory and my 
eternity is assured
Oh I am a pilgrim
Oh a child of God

As I strive daily oh Lord 
Lead me by your grace 
For my one and only prize
Is to see you face to face

Daily as I walk with Christ 
The revelation comes clearer to me
That on this dying earth
I'll have no continuing city.

What will I present to Christ 
At the end of my journey ?
I overcome him by the blood 
And the word of my testimony."

1375;GET IN THE SPIRIT;G;"Get in the Spirit (3x)

The time has come for this 
Church to go higher in the Spirit
God sent us messages on faith 
to take us higher in the Spirit

supernatural things get in the 
Spirit

CHORUS
We'll see the sick healed, the 
blind see, the lame walk
The dumb talk, the deaf hear
Get in the Spirit.

We'll see the power of true 
confession when we get in the

Our body spirit and soul will 
come in subjection to our 
confession
When we get in the Spirit
We'll see our circumstances 
under our feet when we get in

Unto the going down of the same 
With hearts of thanksgiving Lord 
We praise your Holy name
And there is no other 
That deserves all glory
And there is no other
That we could rely on
And place our trust

You've been our guiding light 
On our journey
You're the pillar of Fire

1378;I CAN DO ALL THINGS…;C;"When I look at myself 
in the mirror of the Word
I see so much to be fulfilled
And I know I'll bring to pass 
that glorious mystery
If only I walk in His will
And I know the way to certain 
victory
Is to die the death 
to all that's inside me
So it's not I that live but 
Christ who lives in me.

CHORUS
I can do all things through Christ 
who strengthens me
I can be all that God wants me to 
be 
I'll fulfill the greater works
I will bring his word to pass
I'll become that living reality
I can do all things through Christ 
that strengthens me.	

There's a challenge of this age
But the promise to the bride
Is the stature of a perfect man
And I know the way to reach that 
seventh step
Is only through self sacrifice
With the word of God deep 
inside me
And the Holy Ghost to lead and 
guide me 
With my eyes fixed on the cross
I count all things as naught
It's not my will but Thine
And in His perfect strength I'll
find."

But You're leading with the Pillar 
of Fire
Look. Oh children we are 
ascending higher

There was a stage of the 
wilderness 
But You always declared Your 
righteousness 
For when sickness fell in the 
camp that day
The brazen serpent was lifted 
And You showed us back the way

Years have rolled on and we've 
entered the land
With a Joshua commission and 
the Holy Ghost on hand
Fear not children for the faith is 
here 
It will manifest the third pull and 
rapture us away."
1381;OPEN MY EYES/EARS LORD;D;"Open my eyes Lord
I want to see Jesus
To reach out and touch him
To say that I love you
Open my ears Lord
And teach me to listen
Open my eyes Lord
I want to see Jesus"
1382;I'LL WALK CLOSER;F;"Dear Lord I hear You calling me 
into a deeper life
Away from all my doubts and fears
Away from all my strife
And through the noises around me
I can hear Your still small voice
Calling me to walk a little closer (2x)

Teach me how I must spend my 
time as the days roll on
I need to know I'm growing
With the breaking of each dawn
Give me more of Your Spirit
That I can live more conscious Lord
So I can walk a little closer (2x)

I've seen You broke the barriers 
down that separated us
Now in you I have more confidence
In you I've learned to trust
I'm growing in my understanding of 
Your holy love
Now I will walk a little closer (2x)"
1383;SAIL ON - SAIL ON;A;"CHORUS
Land Ahoy! Land Ahoy!
We are seeing the evidence 
upon the water
Sail on! sail on! 
We are going to the Promise land
We are going to the Promise land

We've been travelling in a ship 
on the sea of time
Our destination is an eternal shore
With our captain led by the angel
Who has come to take us over
For he knows we've never 
passed this way before
Night and day the captain has been 
plotting out our course
Studying those maps and charts so 
we won't come up lost
The thing about this captain is 
how he reiterates
What the prophet to the age did 
say
This is what our captain says today

CHORUS
Sail on, sail on
We are going to a land God has 
promised 
Sail on, sail on
We are going to the Promised land 
We are going to the Promised land 

This ship has been journeying for 
so long
Through tempestuous winds and 
many raging storms
But our captain keeps her steady 
on her course
Unto the land God has promised 
us
Many ships and sailors stopped at 
ports along the way
Others became shipwrecked 
because their captain did not stay
With the instructions that were given 
by the angel in this day
To say exactly what the angel 
says
This is what the captain says today

The promised land is the fullness 
of the Holy Ghost
A power that is to come back to 
the church
In that hour missing limbs will be 
restored
The dead raised, the sick healed 
by the word"

1385;OH LAMB OF GOD;C;"Your only Son, no sin to hide
But you have sent him 
from your side
To walk upon this guilty sod 
And to become the lamb of God

Your gift of love they crucified
They laughed and scorned him as 
he died
The humble king they named a fraud
And sacrificed the lamb of God

CHORUS
Oh lamb of God, sweet lamb of God
I love the holy lamb of God
Oh wash me in his precious blood
My Jesus Christ the lamb of God

I was so lost I should have died
But you have drawn me to your side
To be led by your staff and rod
And to become a lamb of God

Oh wash me in his precious blood

1391;EVENING SACRIFICE;C;"An evening sacrifice we offer,
At the end of this age
The prayers we lay upon the altar
Ascend with thanks and praise
May they be a sweet aroma
That brings You joy always
As we offer up our incense together
Behind the inner veil

Lord we bring to You, an evening 
sacrifice
Lord we bring to You our free-will 
offering
The temple of our lives
And we come to You, 
With true hearts we draw near
Let Your fire fall upon this altar 
here
Of sacrifice and prayer.

The coming of that seventh angel
Was to restore all things
The fulfillment of a divine promise
That God would dwell within
The super sign, invisible union
The restoration of all things
A people who would reign with 
Him forever
To a race of priests and kings 

The door will close
Intercession's ending, under that 
Seventh Seal
The hidden plan of true redemption.
To the Bride is being revealed
The way into the Holy of Holies
To us is being unveiled
Access restored, dominion is given
To a people marked and sealed"
1392;THIS IS THE HOUR;C;"Bride of Christ, for so long we've 
been waiting
For our promised king has come
We await his appearing
We're being tested, we're being 
tried
We've cried and we've sighed
Since 1963 we've heard these 
things will be
But first the squeeze will come
A quick short ride and then it's 
done
This is the hour

CHORUS
This is the hour that we've all 
been waiting for
This is the hour; the bridegroom 
is at the door
This is the hour, of His appearing
The trumpet shall sound and 
we'll go home
This is the hour

End time Daniels you arise
This is the time of the evening
The king of Babylon has come
He's plundering and devouring
He's causing men to bow
Passing laws even now
But prayer's the only way out
Daniels trust and don't you doubt
That Michael your prince will stand
And in the fire you'll meet the 
Son of man
This is the hour

End time Esthers you awake
The Seven Thunders are sounding
of the genocide that's coming
It's time to intercede
For your people you must plead
In the spirit of sacrifice
Be willing to give your life 
And your desire is his command
In this hour
Soon he'll be coming for me (3x)
Coming to take me home"
1393;I AM ADDICTED;Gm;"I have always known conviction 
lies in the vision
And for one to be committed he 
must be interested
To know what's in the mind of 
creator
And to be like Hannah when we see 
the need to be a house of prayer for 
all the nations about
For we are the ones who've 
been given the mind of God

I am addicted
To the word of the Lord 
A desire to feel the heart of God
And to know his mind now 
dwelleth in me
To see his house complete
I am addicted  (2x)

Now I understand there must be 
a travailing 
A groaning in the inside
When we see the hideous 
happenings
That has swept upon the face of 
the whole earth
Men has lost the sanity of their 
minds
But we are a house of prayer
A river that's flowing out
For we are the ones who would 
get God's elect out

I am addicted
To prayer to travail
To cry out 
To God to be worthy to escape
The wrath of the Lord that is now 
upon this world
I am addicted

I've heard of the seven thunders
And the seals that were broke open
But I've never understood the 
depts. About redemption
But now I know the mediator 
between heaven and earth
Who took the book and broke 
those seven seals and reveal my 
name
Showing me how to be born again
Now filled with the Holy Ghost
He'll finish the work in me

I am addicted to the word that 
gives me life
That will rapture my soul and take 
me away into another place
From the judgement of this world
I am addicted to Hannah's painful 
desire, Jonah's prayer meeting, A 
house of prayer for all the nations, 
the sealing of the elect
I am addicted to the sweet 
savour, the holy royal priesthood, 
the throne of mercy and 
judgement and the immune 
church of Christ"
1394;CRUCIFIED;Bb;"Above all powers 
Above all kings 
Above all nature
And all created things
Above all wisdom
And all the ways of man
You were there before the world 
began
Above all kingdoms 
Above all thrones
Above all wonders the world has 
ever known
Above all wealth and treasures 
of the earth
There's no way to measure what 
You're worth

CHORUS
Crucified, laid behind a stone
You lived to die rejected and alone
Like a rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall and thought of me
Above all."
1395;SOMETHING IS HAPPENING;D;"God knew we didn't have a 
revelation 
Of how to approach him so he 
made a sacrifice
By offering up himself, he 
became our sacrifice 
That we can have access, we 
can approach his throne
But now he bids us at Mizpah 
here to pray
To sacrifice our lives and build 
him an altar here
And as we pray our prayers go 
up as incense
 And the fire of the Holy Ghost 
comes down and fills our lives

CHORUS
I can feel Him drawing nearer
(The presence of the Lord is here)
Accepting our sacrifice
(The presence of the Lord is here)
Something has got to happen here 
2x
So we'll wait here at Mizpah
Something is going to happen here
God is pushing his church into a 
higher place
A church without sin where his 
gifts can manifest
So how we settle for a weak and 
empty life
When the Spirit is calling us to 
higher heights

CHORUS
Saying stay here at Mizpah
Something is going to happen here
There are ministries of angels
Something is going to happen here
Cast not away your confidence
Something is going to happen here
It's God strength versus human 
strength
Something is going to happen here
So as we pray we lift you up Father
For we see what you have done 
for us and we glorify your Name
We remember what was done in 
the bible at Mizpah when our 
father prayed
When they offered up their sacrifices
The presence of the Lord came 
down and you answered their 
prayer
Now we are your children in the 
evening time
Declaring our pedigree, 
expecting you to come
You said blessed is a man who 
thou choseth
Whom thou causeth to approach 
you Lord
And as we pray, our prayer 
becomes more of you Lord, 
more of you Lord, more of you 
Lord, more of you Lord,
Something is, something is, 
something is going to happen 
here…."
1396;I DON'T DESERVE A MANSION;F;"I was lost but Jesus saved me
He gave his life on Calvary's tree
Though I've failed him, he still 
loves me
Through his grace I've been set 
free

CHORUS
No I don't deserve a mansion 
I was born a sinful man
No I don't deserve a mansion
But Jesus built a home for me in 
glory land

It was our sins that he died for
A home on high, 
he paid the price
Who are we that he should love 
us
Enough to give his life"
1397;TILL JESUS CAME;F;"A lost and dying world
Shut up from the way to God
Not knowing how to find its way
Sinful and fallen man, in need of 
redemption
Who would atone, who could pay
Though the blood of bulls and 
goats were shed
It could not atone, the price to 
fully pay
It would take the blood of a holy 
one
But none was found worthy who 
could pay

CHORUS
Till Jesus came
The sinless, spotless Lamb of God
The holy one, the living word 
came down that day
Yes Jesus came
Conquering death, defeating sin
Opening the way back to enter in 
to God that day
When he came
When Jesus came.

Burdened and steeped in sin
No peace, no joy within
Condemned by guilt, filled with 
shame
Dwelling in the outer court
Wondering who could pay the cost
To free me from this bondage 
and chains
Though I searched and cried, 
there was no one
Who could redeem me and for 
my sin atone
Till a priest did point to Calvary's 
cross
And the price God did to ransom 
back His own

When Jesus came
Conquering death, defeating sin
Renting the veil so, we could 
enter in to God again
Yes Jesus came
Paying the price on Calvary
Fully atoning to set man free
From guilt and shame
When He came
When Jesus came.

When Jesus came
What a wondrous work he 
wrought for us that day
Removing the guilt and taking all 
our sin away
When He came --- Praise His 
name
When He came ---Triumphing 
over sin
When He came--- Opening the 
way so we could enter in
When He came, When He came
When Jesus came!!"

Unworthy, I'm so unworthy
Of such love and mercy

As He was stripped and in pain
But on the Cross, not once did He 
think about His shame
As His Blood flowed from that Tree
All He thought about was you 
and me
Isn't that love, tell me, isn't that love

1410;GOING HOME;C;"I'm so tired of living in this sinful 
world below,
So much pain and suffering 
everywhere you go,
People dying all around, 
sickness and poverty,
But I know it won't be long before 
we go to eternity.

There'll be mansions there,
Joy and cheer,
Love for eternity,
There'll be streets of gold,
Riches untold,
Rest eternally.

CHORUS
Going home, going home,
Going home to my theophany
Going home, going home,
I'll cast off this sinful body,
Going home, going home,
Where we'll live eternally
Where the flowers never, ever die
Where no tears will ever dim our 
eyes
We'll sit on His throne 
And worship Him
When we go home
When we go home

We see many signs of the end time
All around today 
And we know it won't be long
Before we are changed and 
taken away
Oh how I long to see His face 
How I long to hear Him say
""Receive thy crown my faithful 
servant, you have overcome.""

And at the midnight cry 
He's coming back 
And the dead in Christ shall rise
And we'll go home, we'll go home.

1411;THE TIME IS NEAR;F;"Jesus said there is a mansion 
That he has prepared for me
And I'm tired of this old pest house,
I'm longing for my new body,
And deep within I can hear His 
voice 
Beckoning me to that place
I see end time signs all around
And I know soon I'll see His 
sweet face.

CHORUS

The time is near can't you hear 
Your Savior calling you to a land
Where we'll never grow old
So don't you bow, don't give in 
Cause in a little while we'll be 
going home.
Now through the Word I am seeing
That before the world began
I was chosen to be His bride
I was always a part of His plan
And even though this world is dying 
I will never be afraid
Cause in the twinkling of an eye,
I'll take my flight through the sky,
To live eternally with my King.

CHORUS

In a little while we'll be with the Father
Can't you see Him smile?
In a little while we'll be home forever 
In a while
Saints you must keep pressing on
And we'll be home in just a little 
while.

CHORUS
Cause in a little while
We'll be going home
(In a little while we'll be with the 
Father)
We'll be going home
(In a little while we'll be with the 
Father)
We'll be going home where 
there's no more crying, no more 
dying
(We'll be going home.)
Where there's no more killing,
No more fighting 
(We'll be going home)
Where there's no more sickness,
No more sorrow, no more pain,
No more tomorrow

Don't you bow, don't give in

King
Don't you want to go to that place
Where we'll never grow old?

1412;SNARED IN AN EVIL NET;G;"A mighty hunter is on the loose
He's capturing everyone he could
He found a way to connect the world
He's got them now under his control

Could you see how the trap is set
The whole world is caught in the net
Many think it's just a brand new wave
But it's the return of the Global 
Village
The mighty hunter has found the way
To catch his prey in this evil day

CHORUS
But thank God we're free
He's given us eyes to see
So we could escape this evil 
Captivity

See the thoughts of a foolish man
He thinks he has such a very 
good plan 
But he's built on sand so his 
house will shift
Cause his foundation's a silicone chip

See how the world has gone off 
to sleep
Through that window they took a 
peep
The web has bound them they 
can't escape
They're being taken through 
Hell's gate

CHORUS
See how this hunter lures his prey
Enticing the world with the words 
he says
Through Jezebel (he) evokes 
laws, speaks lies
With painted faces it's all disguised

But little bride this word you hear 
Is to deliver you from his snare
Watch ye therefore and pray always
That you counted worthy to escape"
1413;RACE TO THE RAPTURE;A;"I'm in a race to the rapture

On the mountain waiting for 
translation

CHORUS
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running the race of my life
Got to meet that chariot on high
To take my flight into the skies
And I'm running, running for my life

Doubt and unbelief
They were heavy burdens 
holding down my feet
But I laid each weight aside
By faith I got to catch this flight
And I'm running, running for my life

Faith, hope and charity
They were blazing down that trail 
ahead of me
But I caught them on the seventh 
peak
I put all things under my feet
And I'm running, running for my life

In that chamber of the pyramid
In that secret place with Jesus is 
where I'm hid
You see He gave me a sneak 
preview
Showed me I'm one of the 
chosen few
And I'm running, running for my life

Pretty soon the chariot will swing 
low
And when I hear that trumpet sound
Saints I got to go
Got to hurry I can't be late
My stop's at the pearly gates
And I'm running, running for my life

I've got to sing! I've got to shout!
You see those seven thunders 
sounding, they brought me out
My destiny's been revealed
I saw my name and I know I'm 
sealed
And I'm running, running for my life

I got to sing! I got to shout!
You see those seven seals, 
that mystery's what it's all about
Satan's scheme has been unveiled
And the Bride she will prevail
So I'm running, running for my life

I've got to sing! I've got to shout!
The seven virtues, that's what it's 
all about,
In perfection on that seventh peak
Is when this masterpiece will speak
And I'm running, running for my life

Swing low, sweet chariot, swing 
low
Soon that trump will sound and 
saints I've got to go
Got to hurry I can't be late
My stop is at the pearly gates
So I'm running, running for my life"
1414;THE BATTLE IS ON;Em;"Blessed are you oh Lord our God
Eternity's only King
In the beginning when God 
thought of man
He was perfect before Him
But He knew that man will fall
So a way was made for Him

CHORUS
Then the battle was on
The battle is on
The Lord has descended
He's come 
The battle is on 
The battle is on
For the day of our Lord has come
 
Now we can see God's plan
For His thought was to redeem 
man 
The book of Daniel is now made 
plain
Two kings, two kingdoms, but 
one will reign
For the beast is taking his throne
But with Michael we will stand again

My peace I give to you 
For you are my chosen few 
Though the battles seem hard 
and long
By my word you will overcome
For great is our Lord
Who has fought to redeem us."
1415;GETTING READY;C;"I hear the sound of the buckboard 
Coming in the distance
For He has made to me a promise 
That I am His Bride
I am getting my things ready to 
go on home

CHORUS
For I am hearing the chariot 
swinging low 
Swing low, swing low
I am getting my things ready to 
go on home

I'm leaving this sinful world behind
Where moth and rust corrupt 
I am getting my things ready to 
go on home
I am leaving this sinful world behind 
With vain dreams and aspirations
For I'm going to a better land

For I am getting faith, virtue, 
knowledge, temperance
I am getting these things ready 
to go on home
I am getting patience, godliness, 
brotherly kindness
I am getting these things ready 
to go on home

I hear the sound of the buckboard 
Coming in the distance
For He has made to me a promise 
That I am His Bride
I am getting my things ready to 
go on home
I'm leaving this sinful world behind
Where moth and rust corrupt 
I am getting my things ready to 
go on home

I am leaving this sinful world behind 
With vain dreams and aspirations
For I'm going to a better land

With God's word in our hand.

In our hearts, we have a vision
And we've made our decision

The road is narrow but I will still 
run for my Prize
Just to sit one day at His side
When I get to that place

But He gave me something to stand

mercies we see
We'll not complain, all we can do 
is praise
With our hands and our lips, our 
voices to you we raise,
We know that demons flee at the

What benefits does it have to give
Is it an investment in eternal life
Or keeps you at the border line

We can live close to earthly kings
Like Lot you can be famous in 
Sodom
Just remember there'll come a 
time
When those things won't be 
worth a dime
When the fire falls it will all be 
burnt up

Friends if we want a deeper life
We got to make a greater

We have to be more sincere
This would mean a lot of shaking 
down

By grace alone we'll make it there"

1430;RETURN OF THE SPRING SON;D;"The bible opens with the 
Seventh Seal
Though it took such a long time 
to be revealed
In the earth there were seeds
God called for light and when He 
said 'Let there be..' 
The seeds were quickened and 
they sprung forth
Out of a darkened earth they 
were called
To manifest the life that lay within
Their Creator was glorified in them

At the rising of the S-U-N (3x)
Life springs forth

When Jesus died they laid His 
body away
But He was destined to rise 
again and on third day
A Mighty Angel descended from 
heaven 
To give witness He was the new 
creation
Twas the first dawn and the first 
sunrise (A dual sunrise)
Quickening power brought His 
body to life
In victory He marched through 
death's door
The saints of old arose and 
walked on earth once more

At the rising of the S-O-N (3x) 
(A dual sunrise)
Life springs forth

I sat with Job as he lay on the ash 
pile God said 
Let nature talk to you for a while
We saw hope for a tree when the 
stock die in the ground
At the scent of water it will bud 
(and bring forth)
The greatest vision broke to us 
right there
We saw the resurrected Christ 
appear
Death's wrath was just like 
winter, it must go
We came forth with a testimony 
of 'I know'

At the return of the Spring Son (3x) 
(And the immortal season)
I'll come forth

We saw the risen Christ when 
the Cloud appeared
On sunset mountain He met with 
us there
Said I'll return according to the 
time of life
In this second cycle we see life
signs in the bride
Then He appeared again in 1976
Opened our understanding to the 
holy script
He made Himself known in the 
breaking of the bread
Quickened our minds to our 
promise and our lives to our age

It's the return of the Spring Son (3x) 
And we've come forth

As in the beginning so is it in the end
We are now walking in Revelation 10
We heard the shout, we're now 
in the voice
Evening time resurrection surely 
is on
He's now unveiled and to us He 
appears
Manifestations show His 
personal presence is here
We're waiting for the sounding of 
the last trump
The sleeping saints will rise and 
we'll be raptured up

It's the return of the Spring Son (3x) 
And we've come forth"

You are the great Kinsman 
Redeemer
The Mighty One of wealth
In whose sight we have found 
grace
We know You will not rest 
Until You finish the work that You 
began in us 
We are Your bride, Jesus"
1434;MY FAITH IS ZEROED;D;"CHORUS
My faith is zeroed to the change
I'm not just talking about being 
born again
But I'm looking to the unseen 
That's where I have seen my 
Lord's appearing, 
The sleeping saints they are just 
waiting, 
They are waiting on us to catch 
the Lord's thoughts to draw 
them out of the earth

God, He made Abraham a promise 
Out of thee I'll make a great nation 
He had no seed to bring the 
promise 
But by faith he did believe 
And by covenant God sealed 
that promise 
Abraham knew the time will come 
When his body will be changed
He'll be young again
So he waited at the tent door.

The apostles they just waited 
They waited for that blessed 
hope They seen the grace that's 
been given 
Unto us in this age
For in their time they seen His 
appearing 
And He gave them the Holy Ghost 
Now at His second coming 
His power He's giving to raise 
them out of the earth.

And to His bride He's now 
unveiled Now she sees Him face 
to face, 
He has descended in the clouds 
Just as He said He would return 
And now you see Him 
He's in the pulpit 
He is revealing all the secret 
things  He's giving rapturing 
grace to quicken your faith 
So your theophany would pick 
you up."
1435;LORD I AM COMING INTO…;Am;"Oh Abba Father
There's a request I'd like to make
The crooked parts of my life
Can you come down and make 
them straight
Oh how I desire to be your temple
Consecrated and pure, set aside, 
for your use
And nothing more
How I desire to see your stature
Every time I glance at the mirror
Oh your perfect Image shines 
forth 
Out of my life, out of my life
So I can boldly say

CHORUS
Lord I am coming into you
In the stature of a perfect man 
I'm coming into you 
In your image and your likeness

Oh! Oh! Father here I am 
I lay before your altar 
My all I surrender
Oh perfection, how long 
I await translation 
The seven steps of the pyramid
The stature of a perfect man 
Faith my foundation, Virtue my 
strength
Knowledge my understanding, 
Temperance my peace
Patience my rest, Godliness you 
in I manifest
Brotherly kindness, Love and 
forgiveness
Then you inside my temple 
Forever make your domain
So I can boldly say"
1436;ARE YOU LOOKING FOR HIM;D;"There was a man in Jerusalem 
Simeon by name
Awaiting the consolation of Israel
And it was revealed to him by the 
Holy Ghost
That he would not see death
Till he see the Lord's Christ the 
Anointed Word
Led by the Spirit he came into 
the temple one day
And Jesus was brought in as 
was the custom of the law
Simeon took him up in his arms
And he blessed, yes he blessed 
the God of heaven
Cause what he has been looking for
He now held in his possession

CHORUS
Are you looking for Him   }
He hath appeared and yet will }
appear      }
To us who look for him    }
He'll appear another time  } 2x

After dark denominational ages 
Seven to be precise
We saw a vision of Angels and it 
testified of a risen Christ
It's been about two thousand years
Since He give us that word
That as He ascended, in like 
manner he will return
Twas February 28
th
1963
A cloud appeared 27 miles high,
30 miles across
This truly fulfilled Hebrews 9 and 28
He appeared again having obtained 
full redemption for you and me

MONOLOGUE
Our prophet suffered 42 long 
years 
For deliverance he prayed, he 
cried he was so distressed
The doctors told him he'll 
never be well
But that was as far as medical 
science could tell
He once saw a vision of what went 
wrong
But he also heard a voice saying 
'it's only six inches long'
Mama's dream showed six doves 
But that was incomplete
For it was the 7
th
dove he 
really, really longed to see
And it was early one morning 
when he awoke
And he saw his deliverance in a 
vision that broke
He went up the Catalina in 
obedience to that voice
Where he saw his dead enemy 
and that 7
th
dove
And this is what he said

As a son of Abraham I consider 
not what the doctor said
We know surely God give him 
his full deliverance

CHORUS
Brethren think of that situation 
you are faced with even now
Call to remembrance the word 
God spoke through His servant
Your enemy is dead, he's still dead, 
Redemption message of Grace
Has come to us on the wings of 
that 7th dove
Now exercise thy faith for there's 
power in true confession
Break through all hindrances into 
the supernatural
And experience the results that 
follow angelic visitation
For surely He's here to meet 
your great expectations!"
1437;SOMETHING SO BEAUTIFUL;G;"The sycamore tree by the wayside
Was made to give man shade
And the lily of the valley
Was meant to bring you praise
The precious rose of Sharon 
speaks of Calvary
And I wondered could there be 
anything
That You could make or use in me
But then the Son came out one 
day in all His glory
And I felt in me a change
And I knew right there and then
The way I was dying
That I was being born again

CHORUS
Something so beautiful,
Something so wonderful
You've made me so much more
Than I ever thought I could be
By the rising of the Son
New life in me has begun
Something so beautiful
You have made of me

Now I'm rooted in Your garden
Your grace all men can see
I bear the fruits of the Spirit
I have faith, hope and charity
My leaves are green with fellowship
And my bough goes over the wall
And like a tree planted by the 
rivers of water
My life will testify to all
And I'm nurtured by Your tender 
hand, 
Fulfilling your purpose
I'm part of Your great plan
For that rising Son has brought 
resurrection
And redemption unto man

BRIDGE
Something so great, 
Something so new!
A life that gives all praise to You
A work of grace, made by Your 
hands
Molded and crafted for Your plan
And I've been redeemed
I've been sanctified
And now Your spirit lives inside
For you've made me so much 
more than I ever thought I could be
By the rising of the Son……
New life in me has begun
Something so beautiful
You have made of me"
1438;OH LORD HERE I AM;G;"CHORUS
Oh Lord, here I am laying in the 
presence of the Son
Let the rays from the Holy Ghost 
shine on me (2x)

We  see  the  signs  in  earth  and 
sky, time is at hand
Fearful signs and roaring waves, 
time is at hand

The  seed  has  become  the  seed 
again, the shock has pulled away
The Bride is called and sealed 
away, the Rapture is at hand
Its  harvest  time  and I  must  get 
ripe, Lord hear my prayer
The  stature  of  a  perfect  man, 
Lord that's my cry

Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, 
arise and trim your lamps
Riding  through  the  midnight 
hour, the prophet cried, 
'He's here!'"
1439;THOUGH WE ARE TESTED;F;"We walk by faith and not by sight
Our. eyes look to the unseen
The Lord Jesus Christ
For He has promised
That we will reign with him
But the pathway to glory is 
through suffering
So count it all joy when you fall in 
divers temptations
For it's only to bring you to that 
perfect place

CHORUS
Though we are tested and we 
are tried
Yet in the midst of it all
We can have peace of mind
For the trying of our faith worketh 
patience
For in my lowest valley He 
restoreth my soul
He gives me strength to keep 
pressing on

Sometimes we pray oh Lord 
please take our lives
We just can't go on we don't 
know what to do
But in that hour we found a 
juniper tree
Where the Angel comes to 
strengthen for the journey ahead
For in our weakness His strength 
is made perfect
And His Grace is sufficient for us"
1440;YOU ARE THE LOVE OF MY…;D;"You are the love of my life
You are the hope that I cling to 
You mean more than this world 
to me
I wouldn't trade you for silver or gold
I wouldn't trade you for riches untold
You are, you are my everything"
1441;MY PRAYER;A;"History is repeating 
But it's much greater now
For a greater than Ruth is uniting
With her Kinsman Redeemer
This is the harvest time
We've seen the Lord of the 
harvest appear
But to come into full union with Him 
This is my prayer

CHORUS
This is my prayer
This is my cry
I want more of You
No matter the price
Total separation, Lord
Not my will but Thine
Take me up those seven steps
Till in Your image I stand

Take me up those seven steps
Till in Your image I stand
Thresh the chaff around my life
So I'll be a pure grain
With no hidden sin deep within 
To hinder You from coming in
All I want is You my Lord
So please empty me I pray
Because I know the more I 
empty out
Is the more that You can fill

A true eagle Nazarite in this hour
The new crop that has grown out
With Your power"
1442;LORD COME;C;"In the days when the Roman 
empire is revived
And the beast is given power
In the time of economic wars and 
strife
I set my face towards heaven
T'was at that time that I heard 
from the angel in the pulpit
Saying arise Oh Daniels
Seven Church Ages are all gone
The gentile days are over
Arise and do you work
So I press towards the mark
Of the high calling in Christ
With my eyes fixed on the prize
I can't afford to compromise

CHORUS
So I cry Lord (Lord come)
Nations now are breaking 
(Lord come)
Signs of judgments falling 
(Lord come
How do I make it through the night 
(Lord come)
And I cry Lord 
(Lord come)
The enemy's approaching 
(Lord come)
I need Your Holy Spirit 
(Lord come)
I want to see the vision right 
(Lord come)
I need a manifested life

Yea do I walk through the valley 
of death
I shall fear no evil
For I know when the enemy 
comes like a flood
I'm raise as a standard
And though I see many fall to my 
left and my right
I'm focused on the vision
I will not be defiled with the meat 
of the king
My God sustained me
And he will deliver me

And I press toward the mark of 
the high calling in Christ
With my eyes fixed on the prize
Can't afford to compromise

And I cry Lord (Lord come)
Nations now are breaking 
(Lord come)
Israel is awakening (Lord come)
The pale horse riders rules the

1443;THANK YOU LORD;D;"I saw the S-u-n go down yesterday
And in it's place darkness appeared
I saw the grains of wheat awaiting 
the Sun's return
Without the promise of the Sun light
They know they'll surely die
And after time and time had passed
I saw a little sunlight at last
A little more, then a little more
Then a little more sunlight than before
But at the breaking of a brand new 
dawn 
I saw the fullness the risen Son
I remember what God had done for 
me
When He took my sins to Calvary
Thank you for a faithful resurrection
Oh what a blessed consolation
When I found nothing of worth in me
You broke the seals of Calvary

CHORUS 1
Amazing Grace how sweet the song
I was lost but now am found
And there is nothing going wrong
Thank you Lord
For the rising of the Son

I saw the S-o-n go down at Nicea 
Rome
Before Paul left at Ephesus
He said there'll appear grievous 
wolves
The serpent found a way to break 
the Son's influence
He preached his doctrines of lies
So down and down the gospel went
He showed a little light in Smyrna
And many saw Him at Pergamos
But less light in Thyatira age
And Luther saw him in Sardis age
It was 1750 a man by the name John 
Wesley
He saw a little Son-light in 
Philadelphia
And many saw it at Laodicea
But at the breaking of a brand new 
dawn
The Son came clothed in a Cloud
With one foot on sea and one on 
land
The fullness of the Son was in the 
Son of man
Thanks for Revelation 10-7
That man called William Branham
He took the mystery of the risen Son
To every kindred and nation

CHORUS 2
Amazing Grace how sweet the song
They that were lost then they were 
found
He gave the blind the eyes to see
And they were thankful
For the rising of the Son

The Son rose in Trinidad one day
June the 3rd at Cocoyea 
To God's servant at evening time
The fullness of the Son light began 
to shine
Saying it's no longer a one-man 
ministry
The Son is risen in you and me
Revelation 10: 8-11 to you the Son 
light was given
And at the breaking of a brand new 
dawn
We were called out by the risen Son
We have the Son in reality
We have our own testimony
We saw the Son rose in Guyana,
Tobago, St. Vincent, Grenada,
St. Kitts, Dominica, St. Lucia
And someday it will rise in Antigua

CHORUS 3
Amazing Grace how sweet the Song
We were lost now but now we're 
found
He broke the bondage upon our 
lives
And present us as the Lamb's wife

CHORUS 4
Amazing grace how sweet the song
We were lost but now we're found
He broke the seals upon our lives
And present us as the Lamb's wife

CHORUS 5
Amazing grace how sweet the song
We were lost but now we're found
He's given us the eyes to see
That we're the Son's beneficiaries"
1444;EVEN SO COME LORD JESUS…;A;"Modern events have become clear 
by vindicated prophecies
History is repeating itself on the 
earth
God and man are being united
Ahab and Jezebel they are married
Church and politics mixed together 
As written in the Fourth seal
The world has rejected the voice
Of its messenger for the last days
They have sat and drank and eaten 
the food 
Served from Jezebel Rome
But in the days when the towers fall
When God judges Ahab for his sins
Who is able to make war against 
Jezebel's false religion
There must be a people like Micaiah
Who'll look back to Elijah's word
And though the system comes to 
steal their lives
They can't deny God's word
And they will say

CHORUS
Even so come Lord Jesus
Even so come Lord
Even so come Lord Jesus
Even so come Lord Jesus

The world again is falling apart
And the signs are everywhere
Signs of famine, wars and 
pestilence
As men's heart fail for fear
Disobedience brought their 
judgment 
And rejection brought their curse
Yet once again man crucify the 
seed of God on earth
And there shall be another 
performance
Of all diabolical cunningness and 
cruelty
As the vesture drips with blood
Yet the word must be fulfilled
And in the days when the towers 
fall
And the white horse rider rides
And the beast is given power
To steal kill and destroy
Yet there is a mighty people
Walking with the faith of God
Faith for healing faith for power
And translation in this hour"
1445;I'LL PAY THE PRICE;D;"We talk about heaven, we sing 
about theophanies

gold
All I have is my life that I want 
you to mold

CHORUS
I give my life, I'll pay the price
Just to be close to you, 
Lord let me die,
Full surrender, 
laying it all on the altar
Just to be more like you
I'll pay that price 

Sweet Holy Spirit 
come now and fill me 
And take away anything 
That you know would hinder me

my body
And I suffer so much pain
All I want is to be completely 
sold out to Him

Every thing seems wrong
We know God has a plan
So on the unfailing Word of God
Here we stand

1447;BORN FREE;B;"I stood in the barnyard looking 
around
At the chickens picking on the

Then one day I heard my mama 
scream

Why do you live in a dream
You are an eagle 
You were born to fly

CHORUS
Now I'm flying 
where no other bird can fly
In a supernatural atmosphere 
high in the sky
Seeing things that I've never seen
He is taking me places 
I've never been
And the higher I go 
is the more I see
I'm now living in the reality 
I'm an eagle
I was born free

Higher and higher I rise each day 
I'm rising to a perfect faith
Rising on a mighty rushing wind
Rising above the rhythm of the 
music
Rising above the clapping of hands
Rising above the joy of the saints

The devil tried his best to cage 
and deceive me
But then God sent His Word to me 
He delivered me

to fly
And soon I'll soar through 
heaven's door"
1448;THE ACCESS;D;"What is it with the secret of the 
access which Abel found
When man was lost and fell 
away from God
This shepherd brought a 
sacrifice of blood
The tree of life by then was 
sealed But as he approached he 
held the key 
That opened up the way to God
He could have fellowship 
With the father once more

What is it with this secret
Enoch caught the revelation of
That he built the pyramid 
Encrypting things for ages to come
This way through blood revealed to 
him
Seven steps to the chamber of the 
king
He walked with God and was not 
found
He transcended dimensions

It was the same access shown 
in Jacob's dream
The gate to heaven to him was 
revealed
Angels passing to and from with 
messages for the redeemed
Oh what great value is the 
access given you and me
The secret of the access (3x)

What is it with the secret of the 
access Paul unveiled 
He showed that lamb was Jesus 
Christ
How He became our perfect sacrifice
And the work done on the cross
Completely redeemed Adam's 
race that was lost
Access by faith into this grace
We now have peace 
With the father once more

What is it with the secret of the 
access our prophet had
That formed him in the image again 
The stature of a perfect man
The spoken word made manifest 
Was displayed as evidence
Seven seals opened up the way

Bringing man across the chasm again
We gained this access when the 
cycle returned
By Him decrypting to us the 
language unknown
Entrance ministered abundantly 
The pathway to glory is clearly seen
Angelic ministry initiated us into 
this mystery

By His own He was rejected 
Now Jesus is mine
And I won't trade Him for diamonds
Neither silver nor gold
Because Jesus is the treasure in 
my soul
Jesus is the treasure in my soul

He brought me out from a dark 
world of sin
I was so lost and so blind
He told me that I am now part of 
Him 
Sharing in His love divine

I am so thankful for His precious

My heart will always rejoice
His tender mercy I now can 
embrace 
I'm glad He made me His choice

When I see Your grace and mercy

When there are stormy skies
Down in the valley 
Or on the mountain top
Despite all the conditions
Under any situation

Up

heavy

It is there my Lord was crucified
It is there he suffered and died
And by His stripes believe you 
are healed
So when your burden seems so 
heavy
Like you can't go on
Remember Calvary

When they nailed Him on the 
cross
I was on his mind. 
Who am I?
That a king should bleed and die
When I think about Jesus
And all that He has done
I remember Calvary

For the mountains shall depart
And the hill be removed
But my kindness shall not depart 
from you
Don't let the things of this world 
Disturb your peace
Remember Calvary

The love of Jesus is so pure
That's the reason why we must 
love Him so
So I will lay down my life as a 
living sacrifice
Because of Calvary"

Is anything too hard for the Lord?

According to the time of life 
And Sarah shall have a son. 

Sarah doubted God 
How could she bring forth a son?
When she looked at her state
She was barren 
She thought it could never be 
done
But with God all things are 
possible
And all His promises He will fulfill
And it was after she judged Him 
faithful
He proved that His word could 
never fail

CHORUS
I believe His promise to me 
A body change I will receive
I'm casting out fear
I'm casting out doubt
With God in control 
There's nothing to worry about
I believe, yes I believe
His promise to me

Satan you're a liar
And you can't condemn me
You see I understand 
It's not what I could do 
But it's what Jesus did for me
And with my God all things are 
possible
And He cannot tell a lie
So I'm casting down my 
reasoning
I'm the sinless, spotless bride of 
Christ

had said

He had spoken

Kept looking unto You in prayer
And the lions couldn't harm him
Because You were there

Let us fly free in the faith of God
Let us soar past our unbelief 
inside 
Let us fly past the barriers of sin
And teach us Lord to wait on You
Because all we want to do 
Is please You Lord

Fly free in the faith of God
Fly up past your doubt and fears
Don't look at your condition

We've heard of Jephthah and Gideon
Of David's mighty men
And we've heard of the power of

We know Bro. Willie and Wilson
Bro. Leon too 
And Bro. John and Frankie Jacobs
Saints who stood tested tried 
and true
Sleeping saints and over comers
Victorious in this age
And in the better resurrection 
They'll be raised

This pull brought us out from Moab 
And from gleaning in the field
Where we met with the Lord of 
harvest
Whom His chief reaper has revealed
And now is the time of purging
We're on that threshing floor
We're being cleansed and 
sealed to sin no more
The token is what we're longing for
The end time Words come back 
to seed
The little Gentile Bride, she must 
conceive
For a blast of thunders and a 
prophet's shout
Its full redemption will bring us out
From the field of gleaning
Into God's house

And look the whole world in the face
And sing Your Word wherever I go
When the tempter comes around
Lord give me strength to turn him 
down
So help me stand Lord

I know believers who lived in the 
ages gone by
They faced temptations, yet they 
stood true
But I'm living in the most evil of 
all ages that ever was
So precious Jesus now help me 
stand and honour You

When on the earth you were 
confronted 
By the tempter you did not bow
You overcame all temptations, 
yes, every one
You defied him, Your precious 
Blood flowed
To cleanse and give me strength 
to stand
So now I pray Lord, by that same 
Blood I'll overcome

When I look back and see 
How much grace and love you 
showed me 
Lord it brings me to my knees 
that you can even think about me
When I am in need you are still 
Jehovah Jireh
Jehovah Rapha you are still the 
great healer
With faith I'll stand on your word
Because you are more than able

BRIDGE
Lord I am casting all my cares on 
you
I know you love me
Redemption by blood 
That's the greatest love story
Full restoration, full redemption,
That's what seven angels in a 
cloud testified
My redeemer 's no longer dead, 
he is risen 
And he's coming back for you and me"
1475;BLESSED ASSURANCE;C;"You have considered me 
when the world despised me
You have purchased me when I 
thought I couldn't be loved
Lord I just want to say how much 
I love You
I lift my hands to praise and 
thank You
For I know all of Your promises 
You will fulfill

CHORUS
Blessed assurance, all is well
Things may seem impossible but 
I know God cannot fail
Just look back and see how many 
times you were at your end
And God delivered you with His 
mighty hand
Blessed assurance, all is well

You may be believing for your 
unsaved loved ones
For total healing when the doctor 
says nothing else can be done
But my Redeemer's the Physician
His report says it's a finished work
So claim every inch of ground 
the devil stole from you all, in 
God's Name

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Saviour all the day 
long
This is my story, this is my song 
Praising my Saviour all the day 
Long

Blessed assurance all the day long
Praising my Saviour all the day long
Blessed assurance, all is well"
1476;A DAY IN SEPTEMBER;C;"It was a day in September
One lonely night something 
fluttered into my heart
I looked around to see
What could it be
No one else but the sweet Holy 
Spirit

CHORUS
A snow-white dove
Flew into my heart
Saying don't worry my child
All is well (2x)

My skies were misty, my clouds 
were dark
Until that daystar dawned in my 
heart
With a message of grace
Comfort and peace
Bringing an end to all my troubles

All around us is war
And rumours of war
And violence fills the whole world
But before one bomb will fall
He'll take us away
To live eternally"
1477;SPEAKING BETTER THINGS;D;"How can I not live for him
I've heard the voice of his blood
Speaking better things for me
Speaking pardon and liberty
Showing me what was done on 
Calvary

It has told me my sins are gone
It has told me I am his son
It has told me he has prepared a 
place for me

I've seen his vesture dipped in blood
I've come back to renew my 
vows to him
That is why I am here again
I've come back to see the Lamb 
that was slain

We heard the emancipation 
proclamation
We have seen the risen Son
Out from the slave fields of sin 
we came
In search of another land

We keep coming back to this place
Cause it holds for us such great 
treasure
Each time we see this 
bloodstained vesture
The price of our freedom we 
Remember

And forever we will praise
This lamb who for our sins was slain
Together with him we will be in 
Eternity

And I thank God for the old 
rugged cross
It's shame and reproach I gladly 
bear
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And I'll exchange it some day for 
a crown"
1478;JESUS IN YOU;G;"I could climb the highest mountain
I could cross the deepest sea
I could walk through the widest 
desert
But what would it profit me?
Nothing

CHORUS
'Cause Jesus in You
Well that's where I'm truly free
Only in You is where I long to be
Everything, all I need is in You
Jesus in You that's where I find 
peace
Only in You is where I have 
sweet release

Everything, all I need is in You
I could rise in man's corporations
Spend my life seeking wealth, 
fame and fortunes
I could desire to rule the nations
But what would it profit me?
Nothing

CHORUS
Jesus, all I need
You are my everything
It's all in You"
1479;BOAZ AND RUTH;C;"Boaz has left His palace
Came down in the field
At harvest time for a visitation
As He arrived at the field
To His great amazement
A different kind of tree
A beautiful flower 
like the lily of the fields
Ruth the Moabite

CHORUS
A story of love started in the 
fields
At harvest time between Ruth 
and Boaz
A story of hearts that are bound 
forever
At adoption time
Boaz and Ruth the Moabite

Instructions were given to the 
harvest chief
For her to be looked after
This Gentile daughter
For right there in the field at 
harvest time
For so much love in His heart 
He felt for her

At any cost to redeem her 
This beautiful lady
That's what He thought about
since love at first sight
Right there in the fields at 
adoption time
Forevermore she would be His 
bride
Eternally she would bear a New 
Name

A great story of love
Between me and my Saviour
A story of hearts 
Bound for eternity"
1480;COVER ME;G;"CHORUS
I'm down here at the threshing 
floor (Cover me)
I'm asking You to cover me
(Cover me) 
I need to hear the secret things 
You're saying
I'm asking You to cover me

I come to You dear Father
Without any special feeling
At times I'm so discouraged
As if my life has no true meaning
Satan has taken away my 
strength
And has robbed me of my wealth
Thou art my mighty Kinsman 
Redeemer
In You I put my confidence
So I'm placing my claim

Draw me closer and closer
Till You and I become one
Spread Your skirt over me
It's You I want to become
When You answer my petition
I'll always walk in victory
I'll walk into the enemy's camp
And take back what he stole 
from me
So I'm placing my claim

BRIDGE
I'm laying my sins and weight 
aside
I'm following wherever You lead
I'll take the fight to my enemy
And take back what he took from 
me"
1481;I'LL KEEP PRESSING ON;C;"Like my forefathers did and their 
fathers before them
They kept the Word of God 
within their hearts
Through tears and toils they 
fought with conviction in their 
souls
Now their children have an 
inheritance 
The faith of the Lord

CHORUS 
For whatever it takes I'll keep 
pressing on
Whatever trials come my way I'll 
be pressing further
For what shall separate me from 
the love of Christ Jesus my Lord
I've counted the cost, I'll pick up 
my cross
And keep pressing on
I'll finish my course with joy (2x)

Like my sister Ruth it is within my 
make-up
To fulfill the task Adam did not 
fulfill
For such a time as this I must bring 
forth this Christ child
And be perseverant in spite of all 
Obstacles

And whatever it takes I'll keep 
pressing on
Whatever trials Satan throws my 
way I'll keep pressing on
What shall separate me from the 
love of Christ Jesus my Lord
I've counted the cost, I'll pick up 
my cross
And keep pressing and finish my 
course with joy"
1482;THE DOVE FLEW INTO MY;E;"I may be sick but I'll keep on 
believing
I know that I'll be healed in Jesus 
name
The devil tried to rob me from my 
inheritance
And the blessing the Lord has 
promised
I looked at my lying vanities and 
said
I'm going to walk into my victory

CHORUS
The dove flew into my heart
I know that He did
He has led me through the storms 
I firmly believe
The Lord has raised me up so 
high
To believe what He has done for 
me
I'm an eagle to soar above the 
troubled waters
He has fluttered His wings in my 
heart
The dove flew into my heart I 
firmly believe 
The dove flew into my heart I 
know that He did

I may be troubled, confused and 
shattered
I may be scarred but I'll never 
give up
He has promised deliverance 
from all my bondage
He wouldn't deny what He has 
promised
Jesus has provided all my needs
Whenever I call on His name"
1483;THE WOUNDED DOVE;A;"From the outer regions of the lost
God has brought us back
Her gates are the gates of hell
And many enter therein
Then at last we heard a great blast
The Thunders uttering
This time they spoke clearly
The mystery of the Seventh Seal
And here we are in the second-fold
of a three-fold mystery
Part being spoken by the Son of 
man
But the other in you and me

CHORUS
The message of a wounded 
dove went home
Now it's come back again
In the power of the Word
Speaking resurrection
Speaking rapturing faith
Full redemption
From a fallen state

With the power that will judge the 
earth 
We are lifted higher
Higher and higher until we all 
come into that Seventh peak
And from there we'll change 
dimensions
Cross into that other land
Where we'll meet friends and 
loved ones
And those who've already gone

A window now is opened
And the light is shining through
Celestial light from a celestial world
Shining into our souls
The dove and the raven are loosed
Two powers in the earth
One feeding on the flesh of 
disobedient men
But the dove in you and me
And for this purpose He's 
descended
A full cycle of time's about ended
And here we are in this reality
While Noah was a coded mystery"
1484;A BETTER WORLD;D;"Take a picture put it in a darkroom
There's a process for it to go 
through
Take it out when the process is 
completed
See the beauty before you
That's how it is with this life here 
on earth
The shot was taken from another 
world
Earth is the darkroom where our 
lives develop
Soon our true beauty will unfold

CHORUS
In a better world, a better place, 
a better life 
In a better way, with better things
In eternity, that's where we'd be
With the one who died for you 
and me

Here we see trees struggling to 
live
But there's a place where they don't
Here we see sickness and dying
There's a place where we won't
We've got no future on this sinful 
earth
Our eyes are fixed on another world
We've got no treasures here below
There is a place where they are 
Stored

In this world we're pilgrims and 
strangers
But there's a place where we 
belong
Soon we'll leave Satan's Eden
Take courage pilgrim it won't be 
long
Down here we have no 
continuing city
But we seek the one to come
We desire that heavenly country
God hath prepared our future home"
1485;FLUTTERING IN;C;"In the beginning God created 
heaven and earth
And the earth fell into a chaotic 
condition
But the Spirit of God moved 
(Spirit of God moved)
He fluttered like a dove 
(Fluttered like a dove)
Bringing healing to this attribute 
of God
Yes the Spirit of God moved 
(Spirit of God moved)
He fluttered like a dove

Transforming the earth into a 
beautiful Eden


Fluttering in (Fluttering in) 
On the wings of love (On the 
wings of Love) 2x
The Lord coming down on the 
wings of a dove

This same God came in human skin
As the sacrificial Lamb to take 
away our sin
Subjected Himself to be washed 
by His Prophet
He said it becometh us to fulfill 
all righteousness
The prophet looking up saw the 
heavens open
And he saw that Dove coming 
down like a fire

The prophet bore a sickness 
most of his life
For his own healing he begged 
and he cried
He looked for the time the Dove 
would appear
To take away his suffering his 
pain and his fear
That day he was led up the 
mountain high
He saw that seventh Dove he 
looked for all his life

CHORUS 2

form of a dove
Moving through the lattices

Can you see Him now (Can you 
see Him now)
The Lord coming down on the 
wings of a dove

The Bride too has suffered 
Down through these years
But this faithful Dove once again 
has appeared
In this second ride He speaks to 
you and me
Have faith in His Word, He'll set 
you free
Nothing is impossible for Him to 
do (For you and me)
He says 'I am the Lord that 
healeth thee'.

Fluttering in (Fluttering in) 
On the wings of love (On the

farm in Siparia
As a pillar of fire over in Guyana
In Central America the Cloud 
came down
Down in Argentina He came as a 
dove
The appearing of this Dove identified
We're on that trail in this second 
Ride

1486;THE BLOOD STILL…;F;"MONOLOGUE
I didn't see Him walk up that 
lonely hill.
Neither His bloody footprints, 
that marked the path to His 
suffering.
As the nails pierced His hands 
and feet, 
The veil was rent in two.
He saw the vision,
This blood-bought church
He saw me, he saw you.
Now we are loosed from all 
our bondage.
Our shackles are gone.
Death, you still have no sting.
I can still hear His blood cry, 
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! 
Freedom!

CHORUS
The blood still cries freedom
From bondage and sin
You don't have to worry at the 
foot of the cross
He wrote our names
Sealed with the blood of the 
spotless Lamb
Hold on to God's unchanging hand 
The blood still cries freedom
Look and live

I have heard but now I see
What the blood can do for you 
and me
It has quickened our souls, 
Made us whole
We have sweet victory
The Seven Seals are opened
(The Son is risen)
That's good news from the tomb
A Seven Thunders message, for 
rapturing faith
By blood we'll make it through
Some have fallen in battle 

Some led astray
But there are some wounded 
soldiers
That need healing today
Nothing is impossible
These dry bones can live
The blood will restore
That's thus saith the Lord
Oh glory to God.

Hallelujah, let freedom reign,
Emancipation is here
Shout the sword of the Lord
The battle is won
Let freedom reign"
1487;ONLY BY FAITH;D;"Child you've got to be ready,

Word

CHORUS
You've got to prepare for the battle
Enquiring of the Lord day and night
To possess the keys to your 
great victory
Only you, only believe.
Victory

See yourself as the bride who 
wouldn't fall
But  is raised up to stand in this 
day
Though all hell is against you 
Only have faith and believe

See yourself in the vision of God 
knowing that God never fails
Although your faith is as small as 
a mustard seed 

Identify the demons you fight 
Understand your position in 
Christ For in these times, these 
troublous times
God gives the faith to prevail"
1488;MOVING UP THE LADDER;C;"The greatest contest now is on
We're in a battle
There's a war in the heavens for 
the souls of men
Fallen angels to the earth have 
descended
And demons from the Pit ascend into 
the hearts of men
But the end time Prophet
Caught a vision of a little Bride
One counted worthy to escape
She shall reign with Him in white
For she's tested and she's tried
And soon she'll see the Master 
face to face

CHORUS
We're moving up 
To the top of that ladder
Form the seventh step 
Into the chamber of the King
And we're holding to the promise 
of the rapture
Marching stately, walking holy
to meet the King

By false doctrine and unbelief
men are dying
Through the power of deception 
Satan's fighting
But Ahab and Jezebel shall fall 
at Jezreel
Their false prophets shall be cast 
into the pit of hell
For an end time Elijah
spoke the Word
And one like Miciah reiterates
Though he's scorned and spurned
The seven thousand who will not 
bow
Determined to serve God anyhow
God's fire will fall to wipe Satan's 
kingdom out

1489;SPRINKLE ME SPECKLED;;"I've considered the leper in the 
day of his cleansing
All his hope was in two turtle 
doves 
The thing that held him captive 
For most of his life 
Will finally be utterly destroyed 
And while she's fluttering her 
wings in the evening time 
Crying Holy, Holy unto the Lord 
It will surely bring full deliverance 
And set him free 

CHORUS
Sprinkle me speckled dove 
Flying Holy, Holy, Holy 
Sprinkle me speckled dove 
With your precious holy blood 
And while you're flying on the 
eighth day 
With the blood of your mate 
It's the only hope for a leper 
For his cleansing in that day 
Jesus Christ when he came to 
earth 

Was led to Calvary 
He was crucified and his blood 
put on the Bride 
He was the perfect sacrifice that 
was slain for our sins 
So we could be free from the 
power of in-dwelling sin 
And when he hung in the midst 
of heaven and earth 
Spoiling principalities and 
powers 
He conquered worlds both seen 
and unseen 
When he cried ""It is finished."""
1490;RENEWED LIKE THE EAGLE;Em;"We were not made to be trapped 
in three dimensions 
We were not made to be affected 
by the underworld

They will be expressed 
And as the time draws closer and 
closer 
And time elapses into eternity 
In my heart there grows a faith 
To quicken this mortal state 
And make me what I ought to be 

CHORUS
I can't wait to leave 
To be translated 
To take my flight like the eagles 
in the sky 
My face is set towards the sun 
And the day is almost done 
Like the eagle we will be renewed 

We were not made to live under 
pressure 
We were not made to live up and 
down each day 
But God had it in his mind 
He had a space of time 
Where he'll be gloried in our fallen 
flesh 
And as the end draws closer and 
closer 
We feel the pull from the celestial 
world 
And the things of earth just fade 
And our burdens roll away 
When we think of the things that 
are to be 

Where there's a deep, there's a 
deep to respond 
Where there's a negative, there 
is positive somewhere
And we heard so many times of 
this place beyond sublime 
And this is where, where I long to be 
And the line grows thinner and 
thinner 
And we get conscious of the unseen 
world 
The sleeping saints want to return 
And we long to be fully robed 
Never to be earthbound again"

You Lord

they stood so gallantly 
Having things in shadow but 
seeing a greater reality 
They died in faith believing that 
this city they'll surely see 

Abraham looked for this city whose 
maker and builder is God 
Joseph said carry out my bones, a 
resurrection he knew there'd be 
God told Daniel to seal the vision, it 
was not appointed him 
Malachi: 4 cried to see the day 
when these things will become a 
reality

Lord, teach me how to number 
my days 
And apply my heart to wisdom 
The age that great men longed 
to see 
Has been reserved for you and me 
And what shall we do with this 
sacred responsibility 
We'll possess our vessels in 
sanctification, to tabernacle deity

Just to think we've received the 
seed that was promised
In Genesis three 
The Seven Thunders mystery 
brought by Seven Angels from 
eternity 
The Word made flesh in the 
virgin, the promise of the

1496;WE ARE REBORN;A;"We are living in the fulfillment of 
the scripture 
The seventh dove came to the 
prophet in the water 
How we ought to have faith 
How we ought to believe 
For that seventh dove we must 
now receive 

Not many days from hence you 
shall receive the power of the 
Holy Ghost 
(The Holy Ghost) 
The promise is to you and I
The prophet spoke and God 
cannot lie 
It is thus saith the Lord, (Thus 
saith the Lord)

Comforter cannot come 
But he said he'll ride this trail 
again in you and I

Oh Hallelujah, All praises to the 
King 
Hallelujah, our praise to you we 
sing 
We are transformed, we're in his 
image again 
We are reborned, we're in his 
image again 

Open up your heart, anoint the 
Word with faith 
That which is spoken of thee, 
spoken of thee
Full obedience to the Word and a 
living sacrifice 
It's an aroma to God, an aroma 
to God 
Then he'll say this is my son in 
whom I'm pleased to dwell
For when we came, we came 
from thought to flesh 
Now we're reborn by the spoken 
word 

There'll be a very short quick work 
Before we are taken off the earth 
In the twinkling of an eye, the 
twinkling of eye 
We'll be capped with perfect love 
We'll have the nature of the dove 
That descend from above, 
descend from above
The winnowing fan is in God's hand 
The day of vengeance is near 
But little Bride you'll be taken to 
his side 
That's why the Dove descend to lead 
us home again"
1497;A TEMPLE ONLY FOR MY…;F;"I have tried to go my own way 
I have tried to do my own thing 
My desires and my plans,
My dreams were in command of me 
But in God's mind he had his plan 
Way before the world began

hindered by me 
He demands my all

And now behold here I am 
I am a living sacrifice 
I am carrying the blood of the Lamb 
I am entering the Holy of Holies 
The wings of the cherubim cover 
me

My life is not my own 
I am a temple only for my king 

Lord you have set me in my place 
You have weighed and 
measured me 
And here I am your temple 
A vessel you ordained to bear 
your name 
You have sanctified and anointed 
me 
Thy holy fire regenerating me
I'm being purified for you must 
abide in me forever 
And alas oh Lord I can see your 
divine Love 
You've gone to prepare a place 
Pre-ordinances you gave to 
remember thee
You have returned just as you said

Of a mighty symphony
The Lord and His Bride
In perfect harmony
He's lifting us higher
To a perfect restoration
There's super anointing
As the Word of God is unfolding
I can hear the symphony rising
Soon we'll be 
With Jesus in eternity

Through an open channel that's 
secure 
We communicate with God 
And as revelation flows to us
We see why we are called
Jesus and His program
We can clearly see
And consciously we're marching 
on
To certain victory

Scriptures I'm to manifest then I'll 
be changed

leave this world
I'm going to another place, 
parallel universe

I'll be changed in a moment 
In the twinkling of an eye
To a body immortal I could never 
die
Changed in a moment to live in a 
higher realm
I'll be changed, I'll be changed

They see mystic lights but don't 
really know
What these intelligent Beings are
So they call them UFOs
But my prophet told me and I'm 
tied to what he said
They're Investigation Angels
And they'll pick me up one of 
these days

I came from eternity, dropped in 
this space called time
And though other mortals look 
like me

Associated with the supernatural 
And heavenly beings"

And Your answer always to me 
Is “My child you’re a part of Me.”

To reveal the Seventh Seal

Word that can give us light
To shine in all the dark places in 
our lives

‘Is this the sign of the end Sir?’ 
Surely You’ve been with us
As You promised in Your Word
Your doing, Lord, is marvelous in 
our eyes

And Lord we thank You for Your 
Voice 
That is not the voice of man
But veiled in Your servant’s flesh
To be our guide 
And now you speak to us
On ‘Dreams Visions and 
Prophesies’

Seventh Seal

Word"
1501;HE'S COMING DOWN;D;"Many Dreams, Prophecies and 
Visions,
We have followed by God's grace.
Just to reach that place of 
perfect faith
Many times we've lost great battles
Many times we loose our way
Yet God in grace reminds us we 
are His.

So like the lily in the gutter,
Let us lift our head up high
Knowing well we have a 
covenant with our God
And God remembers His covenant
The gift of God the Lord did send
Even now we feel His presence 
coming down.

CHORUS 
He's coming down now, coming 
down [like a dove]
The Holy Ghost Power is coming 
down
Bypassing unbelief and fear
We will change dimensions here
Feel Him in the atmosphere, 
coming down.

So lift your voice, O Zion, all ye 
children of the Lord
For you are highly favoured by 
our God
Hearing Him calling out your name
Separating you from sin
Won't you open up your heart, let 
Him come in.

For though every mountain shall 
depart and the hills be removed
Yet the kindness of our Lord
Shall not depart
Neither shall His covenant of His 
peace be removed
Thus saith the Lord that keepeth thee

our wings and fly and fly."

master's use

Jerusalem?
Then with one foot on land and 
the other one on the sea
You came with shoutings of 
grace and revealed my true 
destiny.

CHORUS
So here I am Lord on my knees
Asking for strength just one 
touch from thee
I cannot sing your songs down 
there in Babylon
So I'm gonna fight with sword in 
hand

command
I'll not let you go Father, I'll fight  )

Bride of Christ, I know sometimes 
you lose your battle cry
But now in this cycle, watch all 
your mountains crumble
Mix the anointed word with faith, 
apply the blood it's the only way
Our gates must be fortified as we 
feast on bread and wine
No more room for sin, resisting 
power flows from within
And we'll go marching with 
shoutings of victory as we head 
to glory.

Lord, so many times we see 
Jerusalem's weak, broken, 
dismayed and distressed

fears, burying our dreams.
Restore unto us the joy of our 
salvation that when you return 
to Zion you shall find a bride 
risen out of the ashes, 
spotless, victorious, marching 
onward Christian soldiers.
A risen Jerusalem, claiming 
our healing, claiming our 
deliverance, claiming your 
peace, no more captivity, no 
more mind battles, no more 
shackles.

revival.

Come let us build, lets give our 
lives
For Jerusalem

God has been developing the 
negative
Down through the lives of the 
shadow
Jerusalem is not just a city back 
in Israel
For God does not dwell in 
temples made with human hands
Christ gave his life for her, he 
bore her shame
The saints through the dark ages 
fell and they died
Though she was burnt to the 
ground
There's a promise she'll return
From the ashes we'll rise with 
Holy fire in our lives

There'll be a great uniting, 
An invisible union
We'll meet the sleeping saints with 
our Lord in the skies
It's not a dream, we're the reality
The Holy City, The New 
Jerusalem
God will dwell in the midst of us
The Lamb will be our light
There'll be no sorrow, no crying, 
no more pain
The former thing will pass away, 
we'll live in a brand new day
Come let us build the walls of the 
New Jerusalem
Only He that overcome will 
inherit all things

With a writer's ink horn in his hand
Moving to and fro the earth 
sealing God's children
I've seen the son of man clothed 
in a cloud
Coming down from on high
And I can't help the way I feel
My redemption draweth nigh

Famine on the earth

God's children giving birth

Just before the quake
And just a little while from now
The sleeping saints will awake
I've got leaving, leaving on my mind

Lord take me to that place I need 
to be
For my soul just cannot take the 
things I see
I want to mount up like the eagle 
in the sky
For lately, I've got leaving, 
leaving on my mind

Tried like the gold in fire
Purified by fiery trials
My bags are packed for home at last
And I'm not looking back
I've got leaving, leaving, leaving 
on my mind

So much pressure on the sons of 
God
To stand for Him in this day
And soon all their privileges will 
be taken away

All that can be shaken will be shaken
And very soon the earth will shake
Then the sleeping will awake

That sign God, God in man

Christ is the Mystery of God revealed
Though He changes form
His character remains the same
Now could it be that same 
mystery in you and me
The Seventh Seal, it was silence

We've seen the last Gentile Sign

We've seen her displayed
By the Supernova in the sky
The one that meant the most
Was the Red Square Nebula
But in 87 the first sign did appear
There we saw the wedding band 
of grace
An invisible union has taken place

Now stands the Bride in image

She is Him revealed, the

Seeking after my own selfish desires
Living unconsciously, it's not what 
you require 
But here I stand asking for only you
I'm laying aside self will that's all I 
want to do
Let my life display the blood of the 
lamb
Lift me up Lord into that 
supernatural realm

CHORUS
Lord lift me up, never let me go
Hide me in your Word, take me out 
of this world
Your Word is so real, I can feel it in 
my soul
Lifting me higher where only eagles 
Go

Lord lift me up
Bread of life, you still sustain me
On the potter's wheel mold your 
masterpiece
I don't want to be weighed and found 
wanting
Holy Spirit rain down, hear my 
desperate cry
In these closing days of time I'm 
holding on to the horns of the altar
Shake what needs to be shaken so 
you and I could be one
And though my flesh may quake all 
of You is what I'll gain
Lift me up Lord, I want my two wings 
to fly

CHORUS
Lord lift me up (out of fantasy into 
reality)
Lord lift me up (out of fear into 
serenity)
Lord lift me up (out of pretense into 
deeper sincerity)
Lord lift me up, higher and higher
Lord lift me up (to a place where I 
can have devils on the run)

Lord lift me up (I'm standing here 
knowing I can't do it without you 
Lord)
Lord lift me up (I'm taking back, 
I'm taking back, I'm taking back 
what's mine)
Lord lift me up into rapturing faith"
1517;LED BY THE SPIRIT;D;"CHORUS
Led by the Spirit following God
Still following My Guide, that 7th 
dove
He is leading me in bloody 
footprints he left
It's leading to glory up those seven 
Steps

We have history, from which we 
can't stray
Though it's spoken over and over it 
has been the way
This Spirit of truth that we have received
Brings these things to our remembrance
We know the certainty, of the things 
we believe

From the Jordan to the wilderness, 
the Dove led the Lamb
From there to Galalie and to 
Nazareth into the synagogue
Took the book found the place, it 
was written of him  He read his 
portion closed the book
Said this day is this scripture 
fulfilled in your ears

God's prophet for this age led by the 
spirit that day
Was handed the book by the priest 
as he came to preach birth pains
Jesus preached the acceptable year
But the prophet declared the day of 
vengeance is here
The spirit quicked his mind to the 
fulfilling of the scirptures once again

At every junction we see sovereign grace
God leads his servant in the Word to 
find the right place
Where modern events are made 
clear by vindicated prophesy
Proves It's the leadership of the 
Great Jehovah in this ministry

Heavenly signs as prophesied in the word
Red pyramid nebula, luna, solar, stellar 
eclipses are sure, 
brightest light ever seen, all these, fulfilled 
prophesy
It's only by the Spirit's leading these things 
are being revealed.
""A Dead Enemy"" ""The Sign of The Dove"" 
""Name written in the Rock"" ""I'll Ride This 
Trail Again,"" What's this all about?
It led to the Second Fold, we're in this today
And there'll come down, the wings of A 
Great White Eagle and bear us away
A Rainbow, a Cloud, Pillar of Fire, a Dove
Signs that confirm, 
It is God that is leading us now
The Word being opened, it's so plain to see
Proves it is The Spirit leading in this ministry"
1518;FEAR NOT;A;"From a bastard to a King, that's 
the story of our lives 
We were brought here, by  a 
perverted birth, 
Bypassed the Word of God 
Our nature was of Moab, things 
God despised 
But we met with our Kinsman 
Redeemer 
Who redeemed us by His grace 

CHORUS
And He said ""Fear Not, Only 
Believe!"" 
""All you need, you shall receive"", 
"" I took you from a life of sin and 
brought you to my house” 
He said ""Fear Not, Only Believe!"" 
I am Ruth I need redemption, 
only you can perform 
I'm on my knees in full surrender, 
Lord, I'm ready to die 
The hour has come for you and I 
to become one 
So I'm down at the threshing 
floor, asking you 
To cover me 

I come into your presence, in 
sweet communion with you 
I am under your cover hearing you, 
whisper secret things 
My heart is overflowing when I 
see the grace you've shown 
Now I'm on my way rejoicing for I 
know, it's a finished work...

BRIDGE
For all the promises I've seen 
You fulfilled in my life 
I thank God for my trials, they
only come, 
To make me strong... 

CHORUS
And He said ""Fear Not, Only 
Believe!"" 
All you need, you have received 
I've healed and I've delivered you 
For you're a part of me 
He said ""Fear Not, Only Believe!"" 

Only believe, only believe, all things 
they are possible 
He said ""Fear Not, Only Believe!"""
1519;HOLY SPIRIT TAKE CONTROL;D;"I see the famine, it has begun
I hear them saying let's all be one
I'm seeing Jezebel, she’s in control
Stealing the hearts of men
Stealing their souls 
But Lord in this hour 
Of destruction and horror 
I know I cannot make it through 
if I don't have You
So Lord this is my desire

CHORUS
Holy Spirit take control
Let Your sweet influence be 
upon me
In my heart, my life, my soul
My one desire is for more of You
It's the only way I’ll make it through
It's the only way I'll make it through

I see Melchizedec with bread 
and wine
He's come to feed our souls
He's pardoned us 
For an immortal world
He's preparing us
Rapturing faith to change 
dimensions
I can feel the strange call in my 
soul
It is my theophany that is calling me
To my future home

1520;PERSEVERANCE;G;"For so long in my life
I’ve been looking for the change
There’re many things I’ve put away
And there’s much I’ve rearranged
But when I check in the mirror of 
the Word
My state still seems the same
For no matter how hard I tried
Still too much of me remains

Yet when I look back over my life
And the trials I’ve come through
It was nothing but amazing grace
Lord it was no one else but you
So I’m pressing on to that 
seventh step
Till your image I behold
So how could I ever let go
When Your mercies so freely flow

REFRAIN
I can’t let go no, no, no, no
I can’t let go Lord
Till You bless me

CHORUS
I’m holding on, I’ll persevere
The Angel of the Lord will meet 
me here
For just one touch from you oh Lord
Will bring the change I’m looking for
So I’m holding on to You Lord
Holding on to You
Holding on to You Lord
Till You bless me

Like Jacob I long for that 
blessing Lord
I thirst for that birthright
I’ve been wrestling with the 
Angel of the Lord
And I won’t give up the fight
So I’m pressing on to Canaan’s
land
I’ve past two thirds of the way

And I won’t rest till the morning light
For my victory is so near in sight
But in my life there’s an enemy 
Father
There’s that old law of sin
But like Joshua I must overcome
With my feet on the neck of 
those kings
So I’m praying and pressing on
Till on the mountain top I stand
Back in Your very image oh God
Till I’m filled and one with your 
Word

BRIDGE
Bless me 
I’m not asking for silver or gold 
But that You’d fill me and make 
me whole
From perfect faith to charity Father
Till Your very life is seen in me
I’ll put away the works of the flesh
Every sin Lord I now confess
Father I’ll forsake this sinful 
world
And give You my heart and soul
On my knees I’ll persevere and 
pray 
Lord, Lord, oh Father…… Bless 
me."
1521;HE KNOWS MY NAME;F;"I have a Maker
He formed my heart
And before even time began
My life was in His Hands

He sees each tear that falls
And He hears me when I call
I have a Father
He calls me His Own
And He’ll never leave me
No matter where I go"
1522;ONLY BELIEVE;D;"Sometimes we pray, ""Father let 
this cup pass from me""
But we want to cry out, ""Just 
once more, Lord"" on bended 
knees
We see just one touch of the 
hem of Your garment 
It brought change and full 
deliverance
So I'm casting down fear
There's power in prayer
Only believe

CHORUS
Only believe
Let nothing stand in your way
Issues of blood, troubles and 
confusion
Will have to go back through 
hell's gates
Put your feet on the necks of 
these kings 
Look to the bleeding Lamb that 
was slain
Only believe, just confess it and 
you'll receive

The prophet longed, he longed to 
see that seventh dove
And Lord how we long for you to 
come and fill us now
Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly 
Dove brood over us
Find your resting place in our hearts

The Lord, my Rock, my Light and
Salvation, in You I believe
And by Your blood we rebuke all
lying vanities
Though an host encamp against me
To release fear and insecurity
I stand confident 
Lord You will keep and deliver me

CHORUS 
Lord I believe
Nothing shall stand in my way
Issues of blood, troubles and 
confusion
Will have to go back through

I look to the bleeding Lamb that 
was slain
Only believe, Lord, I confess it

1523;MY FAITH IN HIM;F;"Many times, oh yes
God has spoken here
In many ways and seasons
But in this last age
He gave his promise
To take a people to eternity

I have lived, oh yes,
Waiting for that moment
And all of me is resting on 
His Word today.

CHORUS
My faith in Him
Will take me out from here.
I've never heard
A promise like this.
One day from eternity 
Chariots will break forth
And into His presence
Angels will carry me

There were many of those who 
aimed to be 
Part of this end time bride
But he has chosen a special people
That would love his word until 
the end
And it doesn't matter how long 
his coming takes 
They will keep holding his word 
in their hearts."

Ghost and fire

super sign (2x)

But the spirit shall quench their 
torture
You see the world is filled with 
violence
Because the word is being 
denied
But we stand faithful
Faithful as God's little bride.

Michael has come with the sword
To put devils under your control
Seven thunders have sounded
The original word is restored
Saints no more to be afraid
We are truly born again
Now the king's sword is in your 
hand
Be strong and possess your land

The greater works are calling
The bride she has to go
The rocks has been thrown up in 
'64
The sign, the plagues to follow
The pale horse rider unites them
To the great and final woe
But the bride she's secured
The token is on the door.

They're wounded in the battle

Sisters do the same thing too
Lift each other in prayer we will 
make it through

destroy this body
I've got another one waiting for 
me
So Lord fill my soul with your

Cleanse me and make me 
whole.

God's mind,
I understand my earthly journey

And she has turned at the west, 
Our victory is sure 
We have an open door

When thou passeth through 
rough waters.
I will be with thee.
And thou walkest through the fire,
It will not hurt thee.

You shall have no other God but me,
Because I have no other wife but

After six thousand years
After seven Church Ages had 
gone
God himself came down with healing 
in his wings to mark the end of 
man's suffering
So there shall be deliverance in Zion

And there shall be an outpouring 
of the Holy Ghost

We saw signs like the Nebula 
Saying rejoice O Zion your 
deliverance has come 

Flesh and blood hath not 
revealed these things to us 
But the spirit of revelation
The spring sun has returned and 
is loosed upon the earth 
Bringing full redemption to his 
Church

With one foot on the sea and one 
on the land
He holdeth the seven stars in his 
right hand
He played the role of the great 
enforcer
He'll fight for his people in this 
dreadful hour
He holds the key of death and

great things concerning you

CHORUS"
1537;I'M FREE;G;"When I think of Jesus
This man who died for me; took 
my sins away
What made Him give his life?
What was the meaning of 
Amazing Grace?
I just couldn't see
This Bloody Lamb that was slain, 
for me
I could not believe
The suffering He bore; took my 
place, on that tree

CHORUS
(I'm) Free
From the bondage of sin
Christ now dwells within
I'm Free
He was the perfect sacrifice
The Lamb gave me His life

Despised and rejected
It pleased the father to give His 
son for my life
Smitten and afflicted
I am now a prisoner of Christ
I've never known such love
To save me from the wrath, He 
covered me,
With His blood
Amazing Grace I see
Justified I stand;

1538;ON MY KNEES;D;"The time has come, divine 
revelation in God's word
His grace I see, when I see how 
He has chosen me
And it happens every day, when 
I begin to pray
It burns within my heart, the 
things He always says
He revealeth onto me, what I 
was born to be in this day

CHORUS
So I am staying (On my knees)
Patiently waiting (On my knees)
For your outpouring (On my 
knees)
Oh Lord I need You (On my 
knees)

Now I believe, that I was born a 
predestinated seed
Amazing grace, has chosen me 
to run this race
So I will give my life to Him, 
perfected without sin
I can't do this on my own, Lord 
put flesh on these dry bones
If it takes my life to give, for You I 
will live I need You Lord

BRIDGE
I've read the scriptures in the 
bible, about the Mighty Gentile 
Warrior
The painful desire of Hannah, 
and the fearless move of Esther
Lord I believe that they were true, 
and the token they received, but 
what about me?
I know my battles are all won, that's 
why I sing my song
I know blessings are all mine, but 
it will just take time
So like Elijah here I stay, with 
faith in such a way to know you'll 
come"
1539;SWEET INFLUENCES;D;"There is an influence upon me 
that I know is real
A connection from a realm 
somewhere in the unseen
It's an influence that's heavenly it 
comes from above
It's Jesus, the great fountain of 
agape love

CHORUS
The sweet influence of Jesus 
Christ
Sweet influences of the Seven 
Stars
Held firmly by Orion's bands, 
secured in his love
Sweet influences flows from 
Above

It gives me real conviction when I 
tend to stray
It keeps me walking in the 
straight and narrow way
When friends around me try to 
shake me from my stand
I'm influenced by Jesus and held 
firm in His hand

I see a world of people all going 
downstream 
It's evident their influence comes 
from beneath
But something keeps me going 
upstream against that flow
It's the influence of Jesus that's 
upon me I know
A great cloud of witnesses 
stands in glory today
They overcame by the word God 
opened up in their day
I'm identified with these who took 
that great stand
All influenced by Pleiades the 
stars in His right hand"
1540;THE HOUR HAS…;F / G;"We've seen God in creation
As the lion, the lion of Judah
We saw the dove, his holy spirit
We've seen him in the rainbow 
and the cloud
Then came Revelation 10-7
Who spoke squirrels into 
existence
So what about Revelation 10- 8 
to 11
We are the redeemed, we are 
his victory

The hour has come, that the 
bride be glorified

her Lord Jesus Christ

Hold fast Don't let any man take 
your crown
The lot's been cast, the bride 
knows her portion
Saints this has to be the end of all 
your strife and confusion
We know what must be done 
with the word
Daughter of Zion speak, just 
speak and go forth
The rock's been thrown up

And soon cometh the third woe
So Lord strike your masterpiece, 
purify me
I'll not live in defeat

you stronger}

1541;MY PRAYER;Bb;"MONOLOGUE
If my people who are called by 
my name
Would humble themselves and 
pray and seek my face and turn 
from their wicked ways, then will 
I hear from heaven and I will heal 
their land.

In prayer and supplication I pour 
my heart out to you
Sometimes the tears they fall 
both day and night
Our hands are worn from 
service, our dusty feet climb 
rocky pathways
And all we long for is a touch 
from the master's hand
But I see the finish line, it's just a 
few steps away
So I'll bear my cross with 
thanksgiving and praise
For I'm feeling that strange call 
from God, saying come home my 
child
Heal your people, heal the land

CHORUS
Heal your people, heal the land
There's still balm here in 
Jerusalem
My soul is longing for sweet rest
Heal your people, heal the land.

Our Father, our Saviour, our 
good Shepherd {Bishop of my 
soul}
You've brought me this far how 
could I be lost
Your glory fills the heavens, it 
testifies of my redemption

Our sins and shame you nailed 
them to the cross
But I see the wounded soldiers 
and many who've fallen away
Lord we won't let them die but for 
deliverance we'll pray
For your arms are open wide 
you're saying come home my 
child
Heal your people, heal the land

MONOLOGUE
So like Hannah Lord we cry to 
you, open the barren wombs
Everything we have need of I 
know you are more than able 
and willing to do
Like Sampson Lord we cry just 
once more, just once more Lord
I must see life signs in this body
Healing is here, deliverance is 
here, I know the Holy Ghost is 
here
To restore all that was eaten
House of hell give way, 
Jerusalem will rise in all her glory
And her vats shall overflow with 
corn, oil and wine."
1542;LET NOT YOUR HEART...;C;"CHORUS
Let not your heart be troubled
Neither let it be afraid
For the same God who brought me 
through my trial
Is the same one who will lead us to 
heaven's gate.

Battled scared soldiers, veterans 
of war
Still towing the battle line
You've come through all these 
years waiting for sweet release
Nobody else but Jesus has come 
on the scene
But I've learnt to trust him in 
spite of my despair
I am waiting for that meeting in 
the air {swing lo sweet chariot}
Though this world may despise 
me, that's alright
I've got a man called Jesus who 
wants me at his side

Here we are walking in the 
bloody footprints
Oh what a guide we still have
The mysteries are decoded and 
encrypted in our hearts
Yes we are writing another book 
of Acts
Now Naomi's getting ready, to 
receive Ruth's baby
No longer will she be blinded by 
flatteries

him
Down to the resurrection we're 
going

Restored

going home

The rapture will come, to take 
me home

fold

to my soul 
Saying don't you ever give up,

word are one
Moulding us, preparing a bride,

You took us from the chains of 
death from our lives
One standing in our midst, to 
bring this word to life

We know the locust came to 
deform our lives
To make us doubt the word of 
God by telling us lies

has been revealed 
Shall I your God hide from you 
what am about to do"

For his life to be manifested

All things he hath restore

For rapturing faith we're

Iniquity all around
Judgment has come down
For rejection of God's word.
We see Lucifer and his kingdom
Come to kill and take possession
With Jezebel at his side
To persecute this little Bride

This message has been 
preached
Gone out to the elected

there , Oh yes I'm headed
To the final frontier.

My soul aches when I look at this

And brought man down to his 
lowest state
Now demons move through the 
airwaves
Capturing, deforming and sealing

But Oh little bride like Sarah we

Dunamis for us to conceive
To a faith civilization I will go
The final frontier is what will take 
me home.

We now live between the second

The cunning schemes of men 
are about to unfold

heavenly place
Where all I'll behold is your holy

And we know who our Father is;

In the time of Jeremiah, when 
the book of lost truths was found

at hand,
There was great famine, as the 
head of gold besieged the land
For the rejection of the Son of 
Man 
But the man with the writer's

1556;ELECTION BY GRACE… C-D;C / D;"Amazing, amazing grace, how 
sweet, how sweet that song
That save, yes that saved a 
wretch like me
See I was lost, yes I was lost
But now, now, now am found
Was blind, but now I see

A long, long time ago we were 
searching for love
In all the wrong places, didn't 
think we were worth that much
We were used, abused, 
confused, so misguided in our 
ways
But in spite of all the things, men 
may have seen
God still voted for you

CHORUS
That's why we can say, election 
by grace
That's the story of your life
Election by grace, this is love so 
divine
When they thought no good 
could come out of me
Jesus fixed me up and he set me 
free
Praise God for election by grace

Well some of us were haters, 
even liars, rebels and deceivers 
too
Manipulators, good pretenders
God what were we to do
But one day we wrestle with an 
angel
Not letting go till we were 
blessed
Now you're name is changed, 
saints you're no longer the same
All because of election by grace

Well I'm no longer, living in a 
cage
Since Jesus set me free
Now I stand in trial and 
temptation, even persecution
All because of what God did for 
me
So when the devil, when he 
comes with his lies
You stand and declare your 
pedigree
You've been bought with a price
Saints we will not sell our birth 
right
For there's a mansion awaiting 
me"
1557;GOING UP TO THE HIGH;Dm;"We're been deceived by the devil 
too long
We're gonna tear the devil's 
kingdom down
What he said was his, has been 
ours all along
We're gonna tear the devil's 
kingdom down

CHORUS
We're going up to the high 
places
We're going up to the high 
places
We're going up to the high 
places
To tear the devil's kingdom down

We've gotta be strong, we've 
gotta be bold
We're gonna tear the devil's 
kingdom down
We've got to reclaim everything 
the devil stole
We're gonna tear the devil's 
kingdom down"
1558;INFLUENCE;G;"CHORUS
It's the influence of the influence
Oh what a sweet influence of 
the Pleiades
That has influence and will influence 
And make an influence of you 
and me

Canst thou bind the sweet 
influences of the Pleiades
To everything there is a season
When the deep calls there is a 
season
And a purpose under heaven
And all that I can say

I saw a mighty angel from heaven 
saying come out of Babylon
Then the Lion began roaring out 
of Zion
Uttering his voice from Jerusalem
And all that I can say

Influence by a strong delusion
Then I saw the Lord's vision
Like Daniel my comeliness 
turned to corruption
Like Isaiah I say I undone
And all that I can say

Where ever you go I will follow
Thou this road is straight and 
narrow
Thou has the words to whom 
shall we go
You're the only we know
So all that we can say

I also saw a mighty angel from 
Heaven
Speaking to Rev 10-7
Then again spoke to 10-8-11
Saying prophesy thou Son of 
man
And all that I can say"
1559;WORSHIP THE LORD;A;"God will not reject your prayer
Praying makes you stronger
I have never seen the righteous 
forsaken
Begging for bread and left to suffer
Have patience just wait and see
What God will do
When you lift up your hands and 
surrender
God will pull you through

CHORUS
Oh worship simply worship
If you are crying worship
In your trials worship
If you are hurting worship
Nothing matters worship
He will hear your praise

God goes before you saying let 
there be
Healing your wounds and setting 
you free
Sending His Angels fighting from 
all sides
He's leading the way yes He is 
the guide
Trust in Him He will never fail
He's walk with you along lives 
rugged trail
Just lift up your hands this is 
your victory day
Give Him the praise worship the 
Lord
Worship the Lord, worship the 
Lord
Worship the Lord, worship the 
Lord
Worship the Lord, worship the 
Lord
Worship the Lord, worship the 
Lord 

It is important to understand
When God is speaking
Sometimes He may seem to be 
silent 
But that is when He is working
Have patience just wait and see
What God will do
When you lift up your hands in 
surrender
God will put you through"
1560;SOLD OUT;F;"I count all things but down, 
That I may win Christ in this day,
And all myself and pride, Lord 
please take it all away,
I lay aside every weight of sin,
The law of flesh have no more 
part with me,
I circumcised it all; my life no 
longer belongs to me

CHORUS
Because I am sold out to Jesus,
Though tested and tried, I will 
still glorify his name,
I testify of him without fear of 
persecution,
He deserves the glory, the 
honour and praise

A burden in my soul, 
To bring onto my king a clean 
fresh drink,
When I see his desire, I can't 
help but be a helpmate for him,
Out of this virtual world, he 
brought me into an unfailing 
reality,
I am sealed within; my life no 
longer belongs to me

Where he leads me, I will follow,
Where he sends me, I will go,
For I am sold out to Jesus,
I am sold out to the Cross,

We are soldiers in the army of Jesus
We'll stand our ground; we will 
not be shaking from our place,
We'll endure our cross to the end
We'll hold fast the confession of 
our faith without wavering

1563;I'LL BE CHANGED…………....;C;"I'll be changed (3x)
When this body of flesh no 
longer can't contain,
Scriptures on to manifest that I'll 
be changed… 
Through that door way space, I 
shall leave this World,
I'm going to another place, 
parallel Universe….

CHORUS
I'll be changed in a moment in a 
twinkling of an eye, 
To a body Immortal, I can never 
die,
Changed in a moment to live in a 
higher realm,
I'll be changed (I'll be changed), 
I'll be changed (I'll be changed)

They see mystic lights but don't 
really know,
What these intelligent beings are 
so they called them UFOs, 
But my prophet told me 
something and I'm tied to what 
he said,
They're investigating Angels and 
they'll pick me up one of these 
days

I came from eternity dropped in 
this space called time,
And though other mortals look 
like me, they're not of my kind,
Cause I belong to an eternal 
order and to a world unseen,
Associated with the supernatural 
and heavenly beings

I'm going to be changed in a 
moment, in a twinkling of an eye
To a body immortal, where I can 
never die, no, no, no
Changed in a moment to live in a 
higher realm,
I'll be changed (I'll be changed), 
I'll be changed (I'll be changed).

1564;THE SHAKING;E;"Yea saith the LORD of hosts, yet 
a little while, 
And I will shake the heavens and 
the earth and the sea, and the 
dry land,
And I will shake all nations, and 
the desire of all nations shall come
And I will fill this house with 
glory, saith the LORD of hosts.

CHORUS
Yet once more Lord, who shake 
not just heaven but earth
And many stars are being moved 
out of place but 
There were some who stood with 
Pleiades and Orion
And every age who kept their 
first estate
And know the powers of heaven 
are shaking 
We've received the kingdom that 
cannot be moved
All that can be shaken it will be 
shaken.
Let thy word Lord, shake us into 
Place

The heavens declare the glory of 
God,
Day unto day it uttered speech, 
and Night unto night it showed 
knowledge,
For they are all in God's perfect peak
For tell me what will happen if 
the moon should leave her place,
Then the face of the earth will be 
a darken chaos again,
So what about the earthly host, who 
were made in the image of God,
If we are not in order how can we 
do the works of God?

This world is again falling apart 
and soon
The millennium will be ushered 
in, but first this kingdom,
Will be in you spiritually, for it 
comes in the earth literally,
But in the days of the ten toes 
came that rock cut without hands,
To smite every image in our 
earth made by man,
And know you not the kingdom 
of our Lord is in you,
For this stone did not only smite 
but grew into a mountain too

We were like dry bones down in 
the valley,
Then the son of man came with 
a prophesy,
And out of his mouth came 
seven thundering voices,
To quicken and bring to life this 
scattered body,
Then came noise and is shaking 
and each bone came to its bone,
Sinew, flesh and skin came upon 
on it but it had no life of its own,
No, but when he prophesied 
again, the dynamics came into 
that body,
So that we can be a mighty 
marching army"

Let him live in your heart so you 
can join with us and say

your sins away?
Did you know he rose to set you

time I fail?
Can he hear a crowd cry crucify 
again,
Am I causing him pain that I 
know I've got to change?

silence.
And the lamb with the open book in his 
hand 
Steps up to claim his purchased 
possession 
The perfection that was once in the 
beginning 
He now delivers to his children his 
Offspring

Against the golden handrails Angels 
find themselves abiding And the 
question arises Amongst the host of 
Heaven, Where is Jesus going? 

All of heaven waits in expectation?
As He left the seventh dimension 
Left His eternal home on high 
And Deity entered time?
He came down for you and me?
I believe, It's the revelation?Of Jesus 
Christ?
In the constellation of messengers?
The King's sword is in the hand of the 
last one?
Though our Prophet is now in glory.?
The Word is now in you and me 
The Book did not change hands But 
it's God, its God Enmorphe

To Him who sits upon the throne
Unto the Lamb of God we give all 
praise and thanksgiving 
All blessings, all honour, all power 
forever, Amen amen.

When he rent the veil in twain, 
To the Holy of Holies

CHORUS

Woe was a sinner like me
Given Redemption
Should've been me hanging on 
that tree
Could've called his angels
And say take me down from the 
tree
But Jesus loved me 
From before the world began 
and I
Was Given Redemption

There they crucified him
The most holy one
God's only begotten son
They brought their own 
indictment
When once again men slew the 
lamb
And though many wash their 
hands
Of the blood of the lamb
Tell me what would you do 
With this Jesus called Christ?

CHORUS 
Given Redemption
He could've dropped the cross of 
your sin
Given Redemption
But he made you free from 
indwelling sin
Could've said Lord take this cup
But he said, Nevertheless let thy 
will be done
That you were given redemption

Now in this day we saw the Son 
of Man
This same One from Calvary
Leaving the Heavenly Sanctuary
Coming in a Cloud with power 
and great Glory
He has returned to claim you and 
me
We looked and saw Him up high
This Christ Who has been made 
unto us Redemption

When I consider, the places that 
I am to pass sometimes
the burdens that I have to bear, I 
consider Redemption
When I see the condition of the 
world and it's women
How men's heart are continually 
failing for fear
I think of I being one of the few 
that had been pulled out of the 
mock and miry clay
I consider my redemption
I know it wasn't only me
But I can sing about Redemption
and I thank God for Redemption
Given Redemption

Once again we'll reign as kings 
and priests
Given Redemption
So like John let's worship Him
Given Redemption
He's God's Lamb for you and me
Given Redemption
He's no longer on that Tree
Given Redemption
Now He lives in you and me
Given Redemption
We have come back to Eternity
Given Redemption

you and me

1577;THE WIDOW WITH NOTHING;G;"There was nothing left
Just a little bit of oil
That was all she had
Her situation looked hopeless
Life seemed empty
The fire that she had was gone 
and she could no longer sustain 
her family
A widow with nothing
She was a widow with nothing
That was her story

With the creditor approaching
In her most desperate time of 
need
She stood all alone, no friends 
no family
They read their charges
You cannot pay your debt
Your children now becomes our 
ransom
And They shall be taken,
""she cried'
Lord I have nothing left
I'm a widow with nothing
That was her testimony

But, when God heard her 
desperate cry 
He came down for His own
He quickly came to her as He 
heard the cry of His own.
He led her to find Elisha
The prophet for that hour

Go - Thus saith the Lord
God had already told me your 
troubles will be gone. 
The story of your life will be 
different from now on.
Bring every jar you can find, 
God will transform your life
The little oil that you have will be 
multiplied 
Even now

Your children would never be
slaves and you would never be, 
in debt anymore.
God has chosen you and in your 
home He will work a paradox.

In the house that was empty now 
has everything.
The widow who was weeping 
can rejoice and sing.
Where there was nothing, today 
you can have it all.
Step out by faith and see God 
multiply your oil 
Now your fire's burning, shine 
your light each day.
You've touched the hem of His 
garment as He passed your way
All who saw you suffer at the 
hands of death, now sees the 
blessings of the Lord.

1579;KEEP YOUR EYES ON;F;"I can feel the pressure rising 
upon the land
As the plague of locusts swiftly 
devour its inheritance

for deliverance

his children

Children of Zion lets lay aside 
our weight of sin
That we will not be caught in the 
judgment that is rising
On the dreadful (terrible day of

Upon your promise
There's a trumpet sounding in 
Zion sounding freedom

gladness
Sanctified and holy, signed, 
sealed and filled 
On the terrible day of the Lord.

When I see all nations
Gather against Israel
To steal their inheritance of 
Jerusalem 
The trumpet sound reminds me it 
won't be long again
When the Lord would take his in 
the rapture
He'll hide her away

another

behind 
To face the wrath
Of the terrible day of the Lord

May your old men see visions
May your sons and your 
daughters prophesy
May you never be ashamed

against you

For without your Holy Spirit, 
without your guiding hand
I cannot find my way
But I have faith in your holy 
word, the promises you gave to 
me in this hour
I'm living under expectation,
For I believe that you can fill me, 
even now (Oh Lord)

I know that Jesus, did it all 
before.
What I face now, He has already 
overcome.
If I can have just a little bit, and 
then a little more of His life, then 
each day I'll be stronger.
I believe You've placed me on 
this earth, predestinated to stand 
and overcome.
To live for You in this evil day,

Destroying  and  deforming  all

highway, its biting the people 
With  the  seed  of  unbelief  in  the

power to bind it

Jesus
Joined the Lord's Army
One thing; you must always be 
battle ready
Taking your training very 
seriously
For someday, you are going to 
meet the devil, your real enemy. 

Put on the whole armour of the 
Living God
The breastplate of righteousness 
and the two-edged sword
The shield of faith and the 
helmet of salvation
Standing upon the Word
Always in prayer and 
supplication 

We wrestle not against flesh and 
blood 
But principalities and powers and 
the rulers of this evil world

our might
But by the Holy Ghost in us
We will stand and fight."
1590;DAY OF VISITATION;B;"I've read about the fishermen 
Who left their nets to follow him
And nothing was greater than 
when Christ called their names

Oh how that story touched me
When the Lord visited her 
Then her life was transformed
I read of Zachaeus meeting 
Jesus, the Son of God
His life was changed
Then he made right all that was 
wrong
I read of a man of the Gardarenes
Possessed by a legion of demons
But the Lord delivered him with great 
authority and he was set free

Now we know
That God's tremendous miracles 
Have been displayed
As a sign of His visitation
Yes we 
are the children of Abraham 
Walking in the faith
We stand in confidence 
Believing God is with us
We know that He is the same 
yesterday, today and forever
So let's worship Him right now

CHORUS
This is the day of visitation
Though you may feel so 
unforgiven
God loves the insignificant
He can cleanse, renew and 
restore you to perfection
Rejoice and accept His invitation
Call on Him, He made a way for you
This is the day of visitation
The Lord Himself now dwells 
among us
Now nothing is impossible
Oh you who were bound in sin
If you can recognize His voice 
within
Today is the day of complete 
redemption"

I am that I am I am the way

Just a closer walk with thee is 
my desire
Be it unto me according to thy 
word
And how I long for the day when 
my troubles would all be over
And I know it would be worth it 
all when I get there

may falter along the way
Still I hear him say"
1592;CHANGING DIMENSIONS;Am;"I look over the land and sea 
Pondering the prophecies 
Of things that are to be

By the vision of the word I see 
Ashes on every turn
He'll never forsake His own 
Before the first bomb falls,
We'll be gone

CHORUS
To the other dimension, traveling 
faster than the speed of light
The same way those angels 
came that day quicker than you 
could blink your eyes
We're changing dimensions, 
Changing dimensions
Changing dimensions

We are waiting at the gate, 
Our flight is about to leave
We've passed through all the 
checkpoints 
Through all security
Our pilot is King Theophany 
Jesus, 
On the wings of an eagle leads 
us
The token is on display 
We can now be on our way
And just before the fire falls
He'll deliver our souls
From this world"

Through my life, there are many 
trials;
But the Great Shepherd, who's been

one day I'll be immortal.
He shows it's the narrow Way that

It wouldn't be long.
One day I'll be changed

That my battles are already won.

I've heard about my angel 
beholding the Father's face,
And although inside this body 
I'm trapped in time

I'm of a super race who beheld 
the father's face

I'm going back to that eternal 
World

I came from another world, 
Unseen by human eyes
I'm from another world
A parallel universe
Right now I'm standing here
But if you dare to bat your eyes
I might disappear, in the 
twinkling of an eye
To that other world
That eternal world

I live in another world, 
Where I'm influenced to praise
By My Theophany
That's been singing to me
There's a quickening power
That's been rapturing me
To a heavenly place, 
A supernatural atmosphere
From that other world, 
From that other world"

We've seen the end of time 
rapidly drawing near 
No matter what you've done, you 
can now go free 
Yes all your debts are paid 
If you will just see grace

BRIDGE
We are free 
My chains have been broken
I'm no longer a slave
The prison doors are opened
I'm no longer in bondage
My pardon was signed
It was done on Calvary
At the appearing of the Cloud
We can claim our redemption
Who the Son of Man has set free
Is free indeed"
1599;THE FATHER SAID AMEN;G;"Yes I will speak in line with the 
revelation of my faith
I will prophesy in line with the 
revelation of my faith
Just like Adam in the beginning 
as he was naming animals
God Almighty was resting in 
heaven when he said,
'Your name shall be lion' and the 
Father said ""Amen!""
'You are so meek, your name is 
lamb' and the Father said ""Amen!""
'You fly high, your name is eagle' 
and the Father said ""Amen!""
'You're so sweet, your name is dove' 
and the Father said ""Amen!""
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Ha Ha 
Hallelujah…Amen (2x)

Yes I will speak in line with the 
revelation of my faith
I will prophesy in line with the 
revelation of my faith
Just like Joshua fighting to 
possess the land of Canaan
Then he realized he didn't have 
much time to waste
He said, 'sun stand still' and the 
Father said 'Amen'
'Till I possess this land' and the 
Father said 'Amen'
'Yes we are more than able' and 
the Father said 'Amen'
'Yes we are more than able' and 
the Father said 'Amen'
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Ha Ha 
Hallelujah…Amen (2x)

Yes I will speak in line with the 
revelation of my faith
I will prophesy in line with the 
revelation of my faith
Like the daughters of Zelophehad 
at the time of inheritance
God Almighty spoke from 
heaven when they said,
'Give us our portion' and the 
Father said 'Amen'
'To manifest our father's name' 
and the Father said 'Amen'
'To glorify our father's name' and 
the Father said 'Amen'
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Ha Ha 
Hallelujah…Amen (2x)

Yes I will speak in line with the 
revelation of my faith
I will prophesy in line with the 
revelation of my faith
Just like Peter walking down the 
streets of Jerusalem
Now the promise of Joel 2 finally 
made flesh in his life
He said 'no gold, no silver, take 
what I have' and the Father said 
'Amen'
'Stand up and walk brother' and 
the Father said 'Amen'

Hallelujah, hallelujah, Ha Ha 
Hallelujah…Amen (2x)

Yes I will speak in line with the

Just like Branham prophet of this 
time who revealed the son of Man
He was hunting and needed to 
find a few squirrels
'Let the be squirrels over there' 
and the Father said 'Amen'
'Little fish I give you your life 
back' and the Father said 'Amen'
'Storm, be dismissed!' and the 
Father said 'Amen'
'Hattie Wright, have you boys' 
and the Father said 'Amen'
'Tumor, go away!' and the Father 
said 'Amen'

Hallelujah…Amen (2x)"
1600;TIME VERSUS ETERNITY;G;"At the breaking of the Word I 
came to understand
There are forces fighting in my 
life, a heavenly one against an 
earthly one
Time has tried to challenge eternity,
Tell me who's gonna win, who's 
gonna win between them two
Oh oh oh oooh…

CHORUS
We shall know we shall know 
who is the winner
Between Eternity and time
We shall find out who is the winner
Between my body and my 
Theophany

This heavenly power influences 
my inner
And my inner man enjoys the 
Word of God
My inner enjoys God's promises
Yet the body of flesh causes 
trouble everyday
My friend tell me who's gonna 
win, who's gonna win between 
them two
Oh oh oh oooh…

Like in any fight there has to be a 
judge
He is the One to declare the 
winner
When He blows the whistle the 
fight has to stop
Then we know, we know who's 
the winner
Tell me, tell me who's gonna win, 
Who's gonna win between them two
Oh oh oh oooh…

Then I saw a mighty Angel 
coming down on Mount Sunset
Wearing a wig of authority, 
Then he blew the trumpet
Announcing the winner for he said,
'Time shall be no more, time is over, 
Time has lost, time is finished
Eternity has won'

Jesus has conquered, 
Eternity has won (6x)"
1601;JESUS CAME TO FIGHT…;G;"He was worshipped in heaven
Receiving honor, glory and 
praise 
Before there was a creation, 
I was locked up in Him.

Up there, I fought with Michael 
When that old dragon 
Was kicked out of heaven 
Here I'm now in this terrestrial 
body
Looking back at my victory

And He looked at me
Jesus saw I was in need
Fighting this battle of good over 
evil
So He descended to fight for me

My Jesus descended!
Seven angels were seen 
In the cloud
He has established 
His throne in my heart.

Now all those devils are under 
my feet.
Just when the enemy, 
Thought he'd destroy me.
Jesus came down to fight for me."
1602;SURELY AROUND HERE;F;"Surely around here the throne 
comes down
Surely around here the door to 
heaven is found
And we know
Surely we are standing on holy 
ground 
He is here, He is all around"
1603;AGAINST THE ODDS;C;"Who could ever believe that 
Mary a Virgin 
Would ever conceive, bring forth 
Messiah 
Who could ever tell Elisabeth her 
cousin 
Would be the mother to Christ's 
forerunner 
Although many forces came and 
stood in the way
They could never - never stop 
God's Program
Always in opposition in what the 
Creator declares

CHORUS
Always in opposition in what the 
Creator declares
Gross darkness stands 
intimidating
It comes to hide away 
then tries to Brush off 
Even denying the process of 
creation
But who can stand - in the way - 
Of the great SON
When He begins to shine - on a 
new dawn 
The very spoken word by the 
Mighty Angel 
Will put on flesh - will become 
material
Here I am standing - against the 
odds
Here I am the word made flesh -against the odds
Here I am the Masterpieceagainst the odds 
Can't you see God in flesh again 
- against the odds
Here I am a Living epistle -against the odds 
To prove that God's word can 
never fail
To prove that God's word will 
come to pass

Who could ever believe that 
Abraham this old man
Would see his body changed into 
a young man
Who could ever tell 
That Sarah who did laugh 
Would still receive strength 
To bring forth the promised son
Although all surrounding nations 
Were plundged in great sin
They could never, never stop 
God's program
Always in opposition to what the 
Creator declares
Who could ever believe that Mrs 
Jesus 
Would stand so tall and so 
Beautiful

Who could ever tell that this 
Bride of Christ 
Would finally understand - who 
she really is 
Although the whole of Hell
Came up on this earth to fight
They could never hinder - God's 
program"

1608;THE RAPTURE;C;"It's a virtual world we live in 
Only Jesus Christ is real
If it were possible the very elect
would have been deceived

Deceiving hearts with fear
Hell is swiftly following death 
Spreading chaos everywhere

The pit of hell has opened up
all hell is on the earth
the world is in such a hideous
condition
A way has been made for the 
devil's reincarnation
Troubles on every side 
how can we escape and the hour 
is so late 
what does it take 

CHORUS  1
A rapture

Your God has not given you 
more than you can bear
Hold on

Be strong

Trust and obey, 
There is no other way 
It takes a rapture

Even the earth the is groaning
For the manifestations
When sons and daughters of the 
living
God identify themselves
For her rivers are polluted 
her streams are all dry 
The land is filled with blood 
How much more can she take
This is why the earth quakes for 
a rapture

1609;WE PRAISE YOU LORD;C;"2 Chronicles 5: 13 - 14
It came even to pass, 
As the trumpeters and singers were 
as one, to make one sound to be 
heard in praising and thanking the 
LORD; and when they lifted up their 
voice with the trumpets and cymbals 
and instruments of musick, and 
praised the LORD, saying, For he is 
good; for his mercy endureth for 
ever: 
That then the house was filled with a 
cloud, even the house of the LORD. 
So that the priests could not stand to 
minister by reason of the cloud: for 
the glory of the LORD had filled the 
house of God.

We dedicate this temple to you
Lord
Our hearts, our souls 
These vessels are yours
We dedicate our lives to the Holy 
One
As we praise the Lord
Let's praise the Lord

For He is good
His mercy endureth forever
We stand in awe in His presence
Let Your glory come down
Fill this house
As we praise you Lord
As we praise you Lord
We praise you Lord!

As the singers and musicians 
Unite as one
To lift one voice
Praising the Lord
We lift our hearts
And we sing in one accord
As we praise you Lord
Let's praise the Lord"
1610;I'M GOING BACK;G;"As an eternal thought of God

In the womb of this world
I've had my share of turmoil
But through the ordained 
channel
I'm drawing strength to grow
My life is coming into the image 
of my father
And when I leave this veil of 
flesh In a greater way I will know

There is a divine connection 
between me and father
I always hear His voice
Speaking directly to me
Though enclosed by dimensional 
veils
I press on upwards
To break forth into the new world
My Father's loving face to see

So take courage
Don't fuss or cry for me UIll meet 
you here
Over on this other side
Yes we're separated
But only for a little while
You see my Lord He wanted me 
at His side

Until, and not goodbye
For I'm in his arms
Safe from all harm
Jesus, He's got a hold of me.

You want the rich and easy life
Living full of compromise

Well you're either like Lot or 
You're like Abraham
It's either Sodom 
Or the mountain of Hebron

They all came out of Egypt
And all crossed the Red Sea
Ate manna in the wilderness
Drank water from the rock
But many stumbled at Kadesh-Barnea
And only two crossed 
the Jordan river

Check, take inventory
Where will you be?

A clean cut decision saints
Total separation
End time 'eagle nazarites'

Behind the riven veil
Where the glory won't fail
Where will you be?
Where will you be? (4x)"

could be set free.""

He that the Son has set free,
Is free indeed
No more chains of slavery.
Truth has triumphed with liberty 
He that the Son has set free,
Is free indeed.

For a robe of royalty

Are laying at my feet

When Jesus rose again!"

Your wicked deeds I shall defy
For I shall live and prophesy

I am the resurrection, I am the life
I am the resurrection
I shall raise the sleeping saints 
and shall not die

Lord have Your way and bruise me 
For it pleases You that I must die
That Your life may be glorified
Yet how my senses resist me
And I'm pressed out to the ground
Strengthen me to cast them down

Lord how I feel You vibrating in 
my soul
And I know I'll soon be out of this

Let quickening power swallow up 
my mortality
For I must break these laws of

foreign gods 
But have heard of a land 
A different civilization 
Of a people who worship the lamb

Tell me of this city 
Tell me of the land
Tell me of this people
Who worship the Lamb
Tell me of this earth 
And it's generations
For I am a Moabite sitting at the 
threshing floor

Yes I have been quickened 
my course is changed
I am no longer a stranger 
but a citizen of Jerusalem 
Though I'm a gentile I now have 
access to Him
I am a gentile there is so much I 
need to know
Tell me more about this God
About these dimensions and worlds

supernatural world

Tell of this grace 
Tell me of predestination 
That brought me to this place
Tell me of his mercy
That's changing and quicken me

Branham seed

Who is this man Gabriel? 
The Angel of God
Who is this man Gabriel? 
This messenger from New Jerusalem
He is here, revealing the prophecies 
of God
He has come, to show us our names 
in The Book
Tell me more about this man, from 
this different civilization
And this people who worship the Lamb!

Tell me of who I am 
This elected lady 
Tell me of standing and speaking 
In your image again
Tell me of adoption 
And this glorified body
For when Melchizedek appeared 
He appeared in such a form

(When Jesus appeared he appeared 
in such a form)
You told me I have three bodies
But there's only one of me 
You told me I am eternal
With you in eternity I'll be

Tell me of this bread 
Tell me of this wine 
Tell me of this body that's broken
for me 
Tell me of this way and
How to change dimension

loves me

I want to do the greater works 
And live in the image of Christ
All these promises were made 
for me 
But first I need to die 

Now I'm determined to fight 
with all my strength and might 
And persevere in the ways

leads to eternal life

supplication I know the victory's 
all mine

1625;NINETEEN AGAIN;D;"Just beyond the curtain of time

friend, soon I'll be nineteen, 
nineteen, nineteen, I'll be 
nineteen again

CHORUS
Nineteen again, nineteen again 
Nineteen again, my friend (2x)

How this number fascinates me 
with holy joys of jubilee,
This redemption possession is 
my heart's lifelong obsession,
Therefore then if you find me 
stranger it's because 
I want my body to change
So I will sing it again and again
Soon I'll be nineteen, nineteen, 
nineteen 
I'll be nineteen again

Going beyond the curtain of time 
in the rapture between six and 
nine,
When I see my Saviour's face 
I'll sing and I'll shout for amazing 
grace,
For it is His love that brought me 
in and has saved my soul from 
sin, 
So I will sing it again and again 
Soon I'll be nineteen, nineteen,

I'll be nineteen again"
1626;YOU LIFT ME UP;C;"Lord I lift my hands in worship

I know You'll lift me up

CHORUS
You'll lift me up yes Lord
You surely lift me up (No matter 
what comes my way)
You'll lift me up yes Lord
You surely lift me up

When I feel that I'm unworthy
And it seems so hard to pray
Cause of the pressure of the day
Then I think of Jonah in the belly 
of the fish
He getting to down to pray

CHORUS
You lift him up yes Lord
You surely lift him from the belly 
of the fish
You lift him up yes Lord
You surely lift him up from the 
valley of the shadow of death

There is nothing without a 
purpose
God always has a reason for the 
things that we go through
So whether you're on the 
mountain or low down in the 
valley
There is one thing you must do

One day I know that that final 
step is going to set me free

heavenly shore
Over there is no heartache
No dying in that Land
Just peace, joy, and perfect love

Oh, I see victory
Around the next turn in the room

1628;SEARCHING FOR LOVE;Bb;"I was always searching for love 
Didn't know what I was looking 
for 
In so many different ways I was 
trying to find 
This illusion that was in my mind 
But then the God of love 
Came into my heart 
Opened up my eyes 
Made me realize 
You were always there 
Waiting patiently 
Love was waiting there for me

CHORUS
Love was always there 
Deep on the inside 
It only took a spark 
To bring it in to life 
Love can take two hearts 
That were far apart 
The power of true love 
Can make them beat as one 
The power of true love

Look where we were and 
Look where we are now 
This could only be supernatural 
Now I stand before you 
Making this vow
For you are my one and only 
love 
Now you know I'm yours and 
I know you are mine 
This new love we've found  
Will stand the test of time 
Together you and I 
We will also be 
For love has raptured you and 
me"
1629;SHALOM UNTO MY LADY;G;"This is a song of love and life, of 
a man and his bride 
Whom he has chosen to be wife

and adored her
For he is her kinsman redeemer
He can't live with her, she is his desire
As he sings this song to her

CHORUS
Shalom unto my lady, you are 
my bride, virtuous Ruth 
Shalom unto my lady, you are 
my love and I will keep you

She had fears and doubts but 
the words of his mouth
Drove them all out
He showed her great favour and 
would often whisper
Kind words unto her
Now she has a greater knowing 
of the love he is showing
As he sings Shalom, good morning

When he saw her the first time, 
he said in his mind
'Who is this damsel so fine?'
Her inward beauty, character 
and conviction
Caused the attraction
Now he is only thinking of loving
and living
As his heart keeps singing

Where is thy beloved? What is 
he doing?
Where is gone? When is he coming?
I go to prepare for you a place to 
come into
That where I am you be there too
Soon bride and groom will go to 
the honeymoon
And this song will be their tune

You're the apple of my eye 
(that is you)
You're the love of my life 
(that is you)
You're the Ruth in the truth 
(that is you)
You're the love of my youth

I give my heart to you
It's uniting time and sign
And I want you to be mine
Now and till the end of time

Through the lattices his face I 
can see
You're the answer to prayer
I know that GOD hears

1632;COUNT THE COST;G;"I owe my life to Jesus
If I had many more I would give 
them all to him
I owe my whole life to Jesus
If I had a thousand more, 
That's still not enough
I'd live them all for him 
He did not hesitate to do this 
work for me.

My kinsman redeemer
He bought full and complete 
redemption
He considered the cost, what it 
would take to free my soul
Came down from his glory 
and made a way back 
to the tree of life

CHORUS
I count the cost 
of what Jesus did for me
I count the cost of what 
Jesus did for me at Calvary
I count the cost as he left his 
home in glory, redemption story 
for me
Count the cost as he left his 
throne on high, 
Came down to die for me

Like Ruth coming out of a 
broken, barren land,
I came in to the house of God's 
bread
Though I be a stranger, 
I followed the voice inside
I was instructed, to the feet of the 
one who would change my life 
So I laid my claim upon the word 
which I was thought
With all my heart I believe for he 
hath proven faithful before
With a promise that he would not 
rest until it's done
He did exactly as was promised 
Oh Lord! I could never repay such love

Count the cost of what Jesus did 
for you and me
Count the cost of what Jesus did 
for you and me at Calvary
Count the cost as he left his 
home in glory, redemption story for 
you and me
Count the cost as he left his 
throne on high, came down to 
die for you and me

On Easter morning he rose from 
the grave

salvation 
we are conscious of the unseen 
presence that is amongst us no 
need to ponder, we have no

There is more standing here with 
us than the enemy

Elijah's servant was stricken in 
fear by the enemy

And joint-heirs with Christ
If so be that we suffer with Him

But not one jot or one tittle of His

And no other will they follow

I pledge my life to Him with my

That by His love and His grace

Till I manifest the living Christ

loving Hand
And opened my eyes to see

That set me free

Sometimes when I feel the guilt 
of sin
Going through my mind
And my memory seems to take 
me back
To all my wasted time
It's there Jesus came and 
showed me
It's not what I've done
To deserve His love, His Blood, 
His grace
Nor the strength to run this race

The life I lived there
Can't compare with the grace 
god has shown
And the joys that Jesus given me
This world will never know 
They told me I've been justified
my life is free from sin
He said child you are my bride 
You are my queen, you're my own
You'll sit with me upon my throne

Now I'm free 
Because the Son has set me free

But in all things, approving 
ourselves
In much patience, in afflictions, in 
stripes
In imprisonments, in tumults, in 
labour
In watchings, in fastings

By pureness, by knowledge, by 
honor
And dishonor, by evil report and 
good report 
As deceivers and yet true
As unknown but yet well-known
As dying but behold we live
As chastened and not killed 
Yet we live

We then as workers together

Always beseech you that receive 
not
The Grace of God in vain
Giving no offence in anything 
that the ministry be not blamed
As sorrowful yet always rejoicing
As poor, yet making many rich

That after ye have done the will 
of God
Ye might receive the promise
After, that which ye have heard 

CHORUS
For yet a little while 
He that shall come, will come 
And will not tarry

Now the just shall live by faith
But if any man draw back
God shall have no pleasure in 
him
But we are not of them that draw 
back unto perdition
But unto true perfection

It is a fearful thing to fall
Into the hands of the living God
But call to remembrance the 
former days 
After you were illuminated ye 
endured a great fight of affliction
And held true to your confession"
1645;THE FINISH WORK IS…;;"I lift my eyes to Calvary
Where the sin question was 
settled 
The great Masterpiece of God 
was smitten
Without reservation the lamb 
gave up His life
Now every need I have He will 
Supply

CHORUS:
All the way from earth to glory }
The finish work is sufficient for 
me }
It is sufficient for me} 2x

All the blessings He made 
secure 
He will not withhold it from me
I see before me a vision of 
Calvary 
And know I know I have no need 
of fear
Presenting my token with my 
prayer 
I'll look and live!

BRIDGE
He was the slain lamb that
stayed death's wrath in Egypt's
land
And the mighty Red Sea, that 
drowned our enemies
The Rock smitten once, in the 
midst of the elders
Bringing forth its living waters
The brazen serpent lifted, so we 
could look and live
Then the Ark in the midst of 
Jordan, smiting death the last 
enemy
And in the new land we'll keep 
the Communion"
1646;HIS PERFECT PLAN;F;"In his wounding he thought of my 
transgressions
As he was being bruised, he 
thought of my iniquities
when he was being chastised he 
thought of my peace
as he took those stripes, of every 
sickness that could afflict me
For in his dying, he had in mind
Making provisions for my entire 
earthly life
He thought of everything 
He thought of everything
(Absolutely everything) He knew 
I'd ever need.

CHORUS:
Before the foundation of the 
world
T'was written in the heavens that 
he would
Be the perfect sacrifice to atone 
for all mankind
In God's thoughts the work's 
already done
Creation was made to reveal his 
redemption
His perfect plan was to make His 
love known unto man.

BRIDGE
When it seems the enemy is 
after me
I see him drowning in the Red 
Sea
God destroyed my enemy
Should sickness try to afflict this 
body
I see Christ lifted up on Calvary's 
tree
Healing paid for me
For any condition body, spirit and 
soul
Forever settled in heaven, is 
God's eternal word
It all comes down to the 
completeness
Of his redemptive work."
1647;HALLELUJAH PRAISE THE...;C;"Lord you knew what you were 
doing 
when you carried the cross that 
was meant for me
It was divine intervention and 
mercy for us to be redeemed
That bitter walk up Golgotha's hill 
opened the window for me to 
look and live
You ripped the seals from off our 
lives and now our hearts can 
only sing

CHORUS:
Hallelujah praise the Lamb
Now robed in his righteousness 
we stand
He didn't have to take my place
But because of amazing love he did 
But because of amazing love he did

I am the Lord that healeth thee
And by my stripes you are 
healed
Jus t keep the vision of your slain 
enemy
Who was destroyed on Calvary
Now we'll walk in sweet 
communion at your table to supp 
with thee
And when you stoop to wash 
each other's feet just remember 
Calvary"

today and forever
And He is mine, Oh yes, He is

today and forever 
And He is mine, Oh yes, He is 
mine"
1649;WORSHIP OF KING LAMB;D;"CHORUS 
Now is the time of worship to 
King Lamb
Now is the time to lift up the 
name of Jesus Christ
Let all heaven and all earth sing
With our voices we raise His praises
Now is the time of worship to 
King Lamb

Let the redeemed of the Lord 
Shout and sing His praises 
Our robes he's made clean and 
white 
We are delivered free from sin

He has conquered death, hell 
and the grave
Now a new day has dawned
And we know our Redeemer lives

1650;THE EASTER SEAL;D;"Two thousand years ago 
We saw the risen son
The mighty angel descended on 
that Easter dawn
The disciples came to see him 
But he was not here
Just where he said he'll meet 
them, that's where he will appear

The mystery has been made 
known, The cold dead body 
raised
No longer are we trapped in 
denominotal graves
The coming of the prophet has 
caused our eyes to see
The feast of tabernacles and the 
year of Jubilee

CHORUS 
The Easter seal is broken, and 
Jesus we have seen
This promise of the quickening 
came to the redeem
We are waiting on the last trump 
to take us out of here
And soon we'll be caught up to 
meet him in the air

Another son was risen
The first fold work was done
He preach to us the message, 
It's The Rising of the Son
Now the seeds of God were 
laying right there in the earth
They were waiting for this son 
light to receive their new birth

Now right among us here 
another son we have seen
Standing in the second cycle we 
know we're his genes
After the one man scripture
We seen we have a part
The mystery of the Easter seal 
Christ is risen in our heart"
1651;IT IS JOY UNSPEAKABLE;G;"It is joy unspeakable and full of 
glory, full of glory, full of glory
It is joy unspeakable and full of 
glory, Yet the half have never yet 
been told"
1652;SEVEN THUNDER…;G;"Seven thunders in chapter 10 of 
Revelation 
Was prophesied and is now 
fulfilled in this end time
The seventh angel heard the 
shout, knew what it said and 
uttered it out
And all the mysteries that was 
sealed up are now opened

CHORUS 
Seven thunder people walking to 
perfection
Seven thunder people walking to 
adoption
We have seen our names within
And our lives are free from sin
Seven thunder people walking to 
translation (walking to full 
redemption)

Showers of revelation rained in 
1980
And our eyes were made to see 
our own prophecy
That we are a super race, an 
invincible army
And our captain is our King 
Theopany

Since brother Branham has 
come and gone church, where 
are we?
Have you the token, its token 
time as far as we see (Oh can't 
you see?)
We are now in the second fold 
underneath the Seventh Seal
And all the Bride prophecies are 
becoming history

Seven thunders uttered outside 
the seven church ages
Revealing new things, releasing 
all God's fullness 
We know the whole counsel of 
God, operating the spoken word
And proving this is that promise 
since June the third

The Seventh Seal were never 
spoken, it was a secret
It was hidden between the sixth 
and seventh trumpet
A prophet saw it in the shout and 
was commissioned to echo it out
And Spirit-spoken words came 
out of his mouth
We the destined ones are 
crossing over Jordan
Entering into the blessed third 
pull land"
1653;WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT….;F;"My eyes have seen the distance 
my lord had to go 
Just to prove that he really really 
loves me
When he saw the price that he 
had to pay 
He offered up himself so willingly

CHORUS
When I looked at what it cost 
To redeem someone like me 
It cost my Savior his life 
So from my innermost being
Flows rivers of praise 
As I worship my redeemer

Here I am a recipient of his grace 
Giving praise and glory to his 
name 
From my lips there is only adoration 
For he's the one in who's eyes I 
have found favor

BRIDGE
I'm singing! 
Glory hallelujah 
Blessed be his name 
Worthy is the Lamb that was 
slain 
We who were lost 
Found redemption at the cross 
Thank God for the blood!

Glory hallelujah 
Blessed be his name"
1654;CALLED OUT;C;"Some folks I know by their 
name    
some I just know their face?
Some are known by their fame     
Others known by their race?
But in the Kingdom of our Lord    
Each soul has their place?
And in my mind I have no 
doubt    
My name has been called out.

CHORUS
And you've been called out for a 
purpose   
Called out to be a servant?
Called out to lift a standard   
Called out to raise a banner?
Called out to be a witness    
Called out to show forgiveness?
Called out from this world,     
Child you've been called out

Within the prison walls on that 
day   
The jailer bound up their feet?
Stripped of their garments there 
they lay   
Bleeding from where they were 
beat?
But along about midnight,   
Paul began to pray and Silas -
he started to sing?
The earth shook about doors 
swung open wide   
God said  ""You've been called 
out!"""
1655;COME;F;"The world is again falling apart 
Sin on every hand
God's little Bride is calling
The final Voice
In this final age that we live in
Saying :-

Come, come, come out of her 
my child 
Come out of this world of strife
Come, Come
Come, come, come out of 
Laodicea
Come up to Love's sphere
Come, come Jesus say come 

If thou be risen in Christ  
Seek ye those things which are 
from above
Brothers and sisters
We have a Heaven to gain
A hell to shun
Set your affections on things 
Above

Take no thought for tomorrow 
For tomorrow will take care of 
itself
Why don't you, why don't you 
Why don't you consider the lily
Who neither toil nor spin
Yet his Heavenly Father clothed 
him."
1656;COME FOR MERCY;D;"Soon time shall be no more, 
soon we'll leave this earthly 
shore
Six trumpets have sounded out, 
the Lord descended in the Shout
Which unfolded into something 
else, and Christ's Bride knows it
She's made her final turn, she 
makes her final call

CHORUS
Come for mercy, come for mercy
Mercy's door to the Gentiles 
shall close 
The Son of Man have been 
revealed 
To peoples, Nations, Kings and 
Tongues
And the elected ones have 
caught the revelation

Come unto perfection, while 
God's judgement is lingering 
The Supreme Judge is come, 
and pardon is given
But… He changes form, and H e 
changes 
And the mercy seat shall turn to 
the Judgement Throne

The resurrection is at hand, 
Jesus Christ is in Bride form
The resurrection and the Life, is 
veiled behind her skin
She'll do the greater works, for a 
witness to the total lost
And, at the Seventh Trump she'll 
call the waiting host

The Alpha - The Omega
The beginning and the end, the 
Giver of the Holy Ghost
I, Jesus Christ is come, to him 
that is athirst
For perfection in the Holy Ghost
The Spirit in the Bride is saying, 
Come"
1657;CRUSHED AND BROKEN;A;"Crushed and broken is my cry 
each day 
O that You will really have your 
way
Take my selfishness, my pride 
Take my will and make it Thine
Smashed and smitten, fully 
broken is my cry

CHORUS
Make me a sacrifice for Thee 
A broken spirit now is my plea 
Tho' I suffer, tho' I groan 
Let me be separated 
Unto thee my loving Lord
And You whisper, press on lily
Press on home

Tho' He slay me, yet will I trust 
each day 
Trials will not take my faith away
For He's not like mortal man 
To find reasons for His plan
So crushed or broken, pressing 
on 
Will be my aim

For He knoweth the way that I 
shall take 
And so for my own soul's sake 
I shall press on firmly home 
To reign with Him will be my goal
When He's tested me, I shall 
come forth as gold"
1658;GETHSEMANE;Em;"CHORUS
Gethsemane, Gethsemane, How 
I've longed for thee
To drink my cup, my bitter cup, 
painful agony
Oh Lord, let thy will be done, let 
not myself deceive me
This sinful world rejected me, 
now they crucify me 

Laodicea, Laodicea, In you is 
found the blood of the martyrs
You have scourged them, you 
have stoned them 
Oh how you've made them suffer 
How oft would I have gathered 
you as my children together 
Behold your house and all your 
goods are left desolate forever 

This darkest night, my life, my 
soul, is exceedingly sorrowful
The squeeze it comes, so watch 
with me, for the angel 
strengthens me 
Come now, watch and pray, that 
you would not stray into 
temptation 
The spirit wills, the soul yields, 
but the flesh indeed is weak

Earnestly, so earnestly, his soul 
travailed steadfastly
Great drops of blood fell to the 
ground, such prayers of aguish, 
He prayed deeply
Friends if He so prayed, then 
now much more must we pray
To overcome and nothing lack, 
For we can never go back

Judas comes, so cunningly, He 
has sold his soul for money
His words are now a serpent's 
hiss, It is the power of gross 
darkness
Friends, beware the snares that 
abound, in this world of care
Wash your robes and keep them 
white, be sure you walk in 
righteousness

Jerusalem, New Jerusalem, My 
soul long 
With my Lord and King, we all 
shall sing, let us unveil eternity
So live, look beyond the cruel 
cross that is always before us
Fro we long to go and meet our 
Lord, where we will be in one 
accord"

He that shall come will come
And will not tarry

Now the just shall live by faith
But if any man draw back 
God shall have no pleasure in 
him
But we are not of them that draw 
back 
Unto perfection

It is a fearful thing to fall
Into the hands of the Living God 
But call to remembrance the 
former days
After you were illuminated 
Ye endured a great fight of 
affliction
And held true to your confession"
1660;FROM DEATH TO LIFE ETERNAL;D;"Outside in the world I had 
nowhere to go
The Holy Spirit came and put me 
in the know
I was led right to the Word
And the Seed in my heart was 
sown
To give me life and show that I'm 
a son of God

The life style changed from 
natural to spiritual
To put away everything that's 
carnal
And the only goal you see is to 
be perfect just He 
You feel the life growing inside of 
You

Now the truth and way I know 
The growth of life in seven steps 
would show 
That it's from faith to perfect love
Then God descends like a Dove 
To crown the man for attaining 
perfection 

All the while this is what I see
Christ in you is the mystery
To overcome this human flesh
That's the man that God would 
bless 
Who overcomes I would grant to 
wear a crown

All the while this is what I see

To overcome this human flesh 
That's the man that God would

where I'll be
Praising God through eternity 
The Holy Spirit, Christ in me, I 
am sure of victory
His Word, His Will, I'm sure 
would never fail"

ordered by the Lord
Though he falls he shall not 
utterly be cast down

him again
Cause he is a rewarder of them 
that diligently seek Him

CHORUS
You might have many trials and 
you might have many pains 
Many sorrows and many heartaches 
One-time you're up the mountain 
top, next you're in the valley
Can't you see, You're never ever 
a failure until you give up

Many are the afflictions of the 
righteous
But the Lord delivered them from 
it all
And any man that desireth to live 
godly
Must suffer persecution

CHORUS
Just be perseverant, My Lord will 
see you through 
Hold to His hand, he'll take care 
of you
One-time you're on the mountain 
top, next you're in Gethsemane
But you're never ever a failure 
until you give up

Can't you see, You're never ever 
a failure until you give up
As we sail through treacherous 
waters
Keep your compass set on the 
north-star

Who in this world could be 
against us"

Will go on home 

Unmerited- the favour that He

To bring me home today- His

My Sovereign Lord gave 
Sovereign Grace 
To redeem me

And now I'm home- His robe

Amazing Grace, amazing Love

For it pleases You that I must die
That Your life may be glorified 
Yet how my senses resist me
And I'm pressed out to the 
ground
Strengthen me to cast them 
Down

Lord how I feel You, vibrating in 
my soul
And I know, I'll soon be out of 
this world
Let quickening power swallow up 
my mortality
For I must break these laws of 
gravity."
1670;IT IS THE RISING OF THE SON;F;"In the beginning the earth was 
dark 
Without any form and void 
Then all God said was, ""let there 
be""
And it quickened every seed in 
the earth
 
CHORUS
It is the rising of the S-O-N (2x)
God's spoken Word 
When every seed has come to 
life 
It is the rising of the S-O-N
The rising of the S-O-N
All God's seeds have come to 
life again

Then Jesus came and He died 
on Calvary
Rising again on the third day
Bringing eternal life to God's 
promise seed 
That by foreknowledge was lying 
in you and me

On Sunset Mountain in 1963
At Dove's Cove and on Sword 
Mountain 
The Son was risen in Malachi 4 
Proving to us that we are true 
Seeds

Now the Seed of God is no 
longer just Seed
But the Bride Tree has been 
restored
It also has fruits which is to prove 
The Tree is blooming in Eden 
once again"
1671;JESUS IS HERE;;"Oh Jesus is here and He is 
calling His little Bride 
Oh she has heard, 
how she is standing right by His 
side
She is attentive to the things that 
He speaks lip to ear 
About the seven thunders 
That unfolded into something 
else 

Oh Jesus is here 
And He is pouring Himself within
So she can grow and be strong, 
Strong in faith
The promise fulfilled when the 
thunders 
Was revealed to His Bride 
It makes her want to live her 
whole life free from sin

Now this is the time
That He has promised to do 
these things 
For He has said that he would 
ride this trail again 
So he that has ears let him hear
So he that has eyes let him see 
Scriptures fulfilling 
Right before you and me

Now he is expressing 
All of Himself, through His bride 
And then one day they will be 
taking a solo flight 
Oh we will meet; saints we will 
meet in that sweet by and by
At that great wedding supper in 
the skies

Saints we will be in that supper 
Oh that's right"
1672;MATTHEW 24;D;"In the Scripture it's recorded 
He departed and went out 
The disciples came to show Him 
the temple buildings round about 
A vision broke, and when He 
spoke these are the words 
He had to say, not one stone that 
you see standing here
Would remain standing on that day
Later that same evening as they 
sat upon the mount
The disciples came, Lord tell us 
what these things are all about 
We did not understand when you 
spoke this morn, about the 
temple's destruction
And what's the sign of Thy coming
and of the ending of the world 

When you shall see the 
abomination in God's Holy place
Then let not your flight be in 
winter or on the Sabbath day
Let him that's in the mountain 
return back for nothing 
Let him that's in the field stay, 
from Jerusalem flee away

Now there are two other 
questions happening 
simultaneously 
When one's happening in the 
natural, the other supernaturally
For the canal mind can read or 
hear about the ending of the world 
The spiritual man he can read 
and hear by revelation from 
God's word 

When you shall see the fig tree 
putting forth its bud again 
Caught up in a cloud The Angel 
sends the Prophet with a message 
To call from denominations, as 
Israel from every nation 
The Son-of-man revealed, it's
the coming of the Lord

And when you shall hear of wars 
and rumors of wars 
Such catastrophes around the 
earth as never was before 
Earthquakes in divers' places, 
pestilences and famine 
Men's heart failing for fear;
You know the end is near

And when you shall see the 
heavens are departing as a scroll 
Insanity, demon powers taking 
full controls
As in the day of Sodom, as in the 
day of Noah
It's the coming of the Lord - It's 
the ending of the word
The ending of the world"
1673;KNOWN AS WE ARE KNOWN;;"For I now that all things worketh 
together for good
To them that love God
To them who are called 
according to His purpose
And I know in whom I have believed
And I am persuaded that He is 
able to keep me.

CHORUS
For I am known as I am known
Cause face to face in a mirror
My Lord, I now see
Yes I am known as I am known
And I am persuaded that He is 
able to keep me.

For whom He did foreknew, He 
also did predestinate
To be conformed to the image of 
His Son
That He might be the first-born 
among many brethren
And I am persuaded that He is 
able to keep me.

For when I was a child, I spoke 
in part as a child
I understood and thought even 
as a child
But when I became a perfect man
I put away, by His Grace all 
childish ways."
1674;MY GUIDE;F;"Winter's coming and I can feel 
the cold winds blowing 
But I cannot leave this shore
Until I see my Guide leading me 
For He was sent to make sure 
that I don't come up lost 
He was sent to guide me 
And with His help this ole Jordan 
I'll cross

CHORUS
My Guide, my Guide has led me 
to a faith 
That I have never known 
My Guide, my Guide has led me 
to a power
That I have never known 
I have not travelled this way before 
So I must depend on him
I have not travelled this way before 
So I must totally rely on Him
He's my Guide, He's my Guide

I can see all the ducks gathering 
together
We are going to take a long flight 
Before this winter
We were gathered by the Shout 
for the last Trump
Knowing that the Voice of the 
Archangel
Is the Voice of the Resurrection 

There were times that I've tried 
To make it all alone 
But only to find out that I can't on 
my own
He has led me to that Seventh Dove
With an olive leaf in her mouth, 
and healing in her wings 
Oh, to calm my troubles 
within(x2)"
1675;ON THE WINGS OF FAITH;D;"Hear O Lord is my sacrifice 
Don't care how the world may 
criticize 
For all I care, I'm in love with You
I'll bear the reproach for your 
Name 
I'll testify and be not ashamed 
For all I care, I'm in love with You

CHORUS
Be it unto me according to Thy 
Word
Let there be a performance of 
the things 
That was spoken
On the wings of faith, everyday 
I'm climbing 
By the rise of faith, I can see now
Where I'm going 

No more darkly now do I see
Your Word has become much 
plainer to me
For all I care, I believe Thy Word 
No matter what the condition 
I'll set my eyes on that Promised 
Land
For all I care, I believe Thy Word"
1676;RECOGNISE YOUR DAY …;F;"So many people today are 
worshipping
For man was made to worship 
something 
In this religious age we're living, 
everybody thinks they're 
worshipping Him
Some praise Him for the past, 
some for the future that would come
Many don't know He is I AM 
present tense, so they miss 
what's going on

CHORUS
Let's recognize our day and our 
message, 
Look and see what's going on 
Let's recognize our day and our 
message, for you and your 
message are one

It's good to believe God sent a 
prophet, Malachi 4 did prophecy 
Yet one man had to take that 
Scripture and anoint it to his life 
That Scripture's only a record of 
the gene God had foreknown 
His life dovetailed to that Scripture, 
manifested they were one 

There are still many prophecies 
that must be fulfilled 
And once it's timely with the 
Scripture you know it's God 
perfect will 
There's concepts and imaginations 
of how it will come to pass 
But while the Scripture's 
manifesting, Oh! Right in front 
their eyes it's passed 

The rapture's a three-fold secret: 
a Shout, a Voice, a Trump
The Shout - the prophet, was 
the first pull 
And we'll be changed at the last 
Trump 
But right in there is a mystery: 
A little group of the true seed 
Revelation: 8 - 11, well it looks 
like me and you

The Word's no longer in prophecy, 
the history's being made today 
So while Jesus is a-passing, take 
ahold of Him today
Then it's no longer I believing or 
recognizing it's the truth 
But let's go to acting on it, to 
prove that it is me and you 

CHORUS
Let's recognize our day and our 
message, 
Look and see what's going on 
Let's recognize our day and our 
message
You and your message are one; 
you and your message are one
You're greater than Sarah, 
You and your message are one
A greater than Esther, 
You and your message are one 
You are a supernova
You and you Message are one"
1677;STIR ME UP LORD;C;"Let me hear, recognize, and 
move on in thy Word
For I'm called to become Thy Bride
Let me understand the way that 
you're leading
Pressing on for my faith to excel.

CHORUS
Stir me up Lord, let Thy Word 
flow through me
Stir me up Lord, let Thy 
fragrance cling to me 
Let the full revelation of Your 
love govern me
Stir me up; let me be all in Thee.

For there is coming an hour 
When the cries would be useless
There'll be no grace, no more 
pardon, and no love
Then, let me be caught away to 
my precious Lord
But while I remain, stir me up.

When the Anointing comes, as 
Thy Word goes forth
Let it not be my spirit alone
Let it be all of me, 
Deep within my soul
When Thy Word goes forth, Lord 
stir me up"
1678;SPIRITUAL FOOD IN DUE;A;"Our Lord had given the prophet 
this great vision
To store up food for coming 
seasons
For then men would not endure, 
we heard him say
But soon they would turn their 
backs away.
Remember in the dream of 
Brother Jackson
The White Stone that he told 
them look upon
As westward he went for the 
interpretation 
But just a few kept looking on, for

CHORUS
Spiritual food in due season
The revelation of God's Word
The Bread of Life that came to 
us from Heaven
That's the Living Word that we're 
feasting on.

In this day and hour that we're 
living
Millions of souls around are 
dying
Though all around are teachers 
everywhere
Yet for the truth there is a famine
But as Elijah by the brook God 
has sent the ravens
To give him food during that time
So Ephesians 4 and 11
Our Lord has given to us in this 
day.

The prophet said young men 
would take this message
And with it they'll go around the 
world
Teaching how the mystery has 
unfolded 
And how the cycle has returned
Revealing what was hidden 
beneath the White Rock
That glorious manna to feed our 
souls
So let's just lift our hands up to 
Heaven 
For spiritual food in due season."
1679;SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY;;"By faith Noah being warned of 
God
Of the things to come,
Prepared an ark for the saving of 
his house
When he condemned the world
And became heirs of his 
righteousness
Which is by faith.

CHORUS
He's the same God yesterday,
He's the same God today and 
forever
He's the same God that stands 
in me
Glorifying Himself again.

By faith Abraham when he was 
called
Sojourned in a strange land,
Looking for the city of promise
Whose builder and maker is 
God,
And he received for an 
inheritance
The land of promise.

By faith the bride of Christ is now 
receiving
Rapturing faith through the 
seven thunders,
To enter into the promise rest
That remaineth for God's people,
Then He'll magnify her again
In the sight of the people."
1680;SWEET SAVOUR;F;"Let this mind be in you, which 
was also in Christ Jesus
And walk in love, as He has 
loved us
And given Himself for us
As a sweet smelling savour unto 
God
So let the sacrifice of your life be 
unto Him

CHORUS
As a sweet, sweet savour of Christ
As a sweet, sweet savour of Christ
A life that has been tried by fire
And proven to be, much more 
precious than gold
As a sweet, sweet savour of Christ
As a sweet, sweet savour of Christ

Walk circumspectly not as fools 
but as wise
Redeeming the time because the 
days are evil
And let your words be seasoned 
with salt
Ministering grace unto the hearer
So let the sacrifice of your life, be 
unto my Lord

Mix your meal with the oil, and 
put it on two sticks
Thus saith the Lord, if you do it
The barrel of meal will not run low
Neither the cruse of oil lose its flow
So let the sacrifice of your life, be 
unto my Lord

Let not hatred and envy be once 
named among you
Let brotherly love continue
And be not conformed to this world
But be ye transformed by the 
renewing of your mind
So let the sacrifice of your life, be 
unto my Lord"
1681;THE REWARD;A;"I know not the day or hour
When my Lord should come
For of that day or hour knoweth 
no man
On that day I want to be ready
Just to hear Him say
Enter in, my child, to the joys 
prepared for you

CHORUS
Enter in, to the joys prepared for 
you
Enter in, you who are called, 
faithful and true
Enter in, you who have 
overcome
To the joys that's been prepared 
for you 
Before this world began

Hear the parable about ten 
virgins
Five foolish and five wise
The foolish they had no oil, but 
went out to buy
Behold the cry was made at 
midnight
And then the Bridegroom came
With the wise went to the 
marriage
But the foolish five remained

Blessed is that faithful servant
Who the Lord finds when He 
comes
Giving His people meat in due 
season
Unto that blessed and faithful 
servant
We all shall hear Him say
To the joys that's been prepared 
for you
Enter in today"
1682;THE BRIDAL WALK;D;"As we walk together, 
side by side we stand
Holding hands together, 
to the Promised Land
Let us not be selfish, 
we cannot go alone
They must all be with us, 
to sit with Him on His Throne

CHORUS
Oh how we love our Jesus
And how He loves us so
We will never cease to praise 
Him
We'll shout it while eternity rolls

Let us keep on walking, straight 
to Gethsemane
Let us keep rejoicing, seeing the 
victory
There will be a tugging; friends 
will not want to go
This is just the testing, let 
Brotherly Kindness flow

Now we'll walk to Jordan, keep 
on holding hands
Don't be afraid of demons, they 
can never stop God's plans
Looking back at Calvary, 
watching the finished plan
Jesus come and take us, in Your 
Word we stand

Wipe away all sorrow, dry up all 
those tears
There's no time for weeping, 
Saints we are almost there
As we smell the fragrance, 
coming with the breeze
Sound that ram horn, Joshua
It's real! It's real! It's real!"
1683;THE SCEPTRE SHALL NOT …;C;"From out of Judah shall come 
forth a Governor
Who shall rule this earth with 
righteousness and power
From coast to coast and shore to 
shore
Shall be His domain
And in righteousness and power 
He shall reign

CHORUS
For in His own time He'll show 
the only Potentate
King of Kings and Lord of Lords
For the sceptre shall not depart 
form Judah
Until Shiloh comes, in power 

For the sceptre shall not depart 
form Judah 
Until Shiloh comes in power 
Who is this that cometh forth 
from Edom
His eyes were as a flame of fire
And upon His head were many 
crowns
And He had a Name written 
That no man knew but His bride

For six thousand years satan has 
been building his eden
So as god he will rule all nations
But look out Adonijah
The King is after you
For all your kingdoms will be 
trodden down

MONOLOGUE:
Judah-Judah-Judah! The 
sceptre shall not depart from 
Judah
For six thousand years Satan 
has squatted on our inheritance
Polluting on the every hand, to 
build his Eden
But arise, let's make war ye 
chosen angels
You who have kept your first estate
For we must crown our Lord Jesus
The only true King and Potentate"
1684;THE FINAL CALL;D;"He who's athirst let him come, he 
who hungers let him also come.
The fountain is open still, eternal 
life He quickly imparts
He who's athirst let him come, he 
who hungers let him also come.
The fountain is open still
As the Spirit and the Bride say 
come.

The Bride, here she stands, 
chosen and perfected.
She's now in plain view, 
displaying the Token
Just listen to her voice, as the 
Spirit echoes
This is the final voice, when the 
Spirit and the Bride say come

She's filled with oil; her lamp's 
trimmed and burning
For God Himself, has sealed 
those virtues in 
She's anchored in Christ, where 
the plagues cannot touch her
Being in that final round, where 
the mercy seat is seen

We see all judgement signs, as 
they move around us
Friends, hear those cherubim, 
wooing us back to the Tree of 
Life
The last drops of blood, are 
sprinkled on the mercy seat
This is the final call, as time is no 
more.

True seeds of promise, they are 
nearing adoption.
The last ones and twos, are 
quickly entering in
She's made herself ready, for the 
marriage of the Lamb
Clothed in purity, as our prophet 
did foretell

He who's athirst let him come, 
He who hungers let him come
He who heareth let him come, 
He who's earthbound let him 
come
Come now, come now, Drink 
from the water of life
As the Spirit and the Bride say 
come"
1685;THE JUST AND THE UNJUST;D;"The fear of the Lord is the 
Beginning of knowledge
But fools despise wisdom and 
instruction
Trust in the Lord with all thine 
heart
And lean not unto thine own 
Understanding

CHORUS
For the just shall inherit glory 
Bu shame shall be the promotion 
of fools
For the just shall inherit glory
Let not mercy and truth forsake 
Thee

The curse of the Lord is in the 
house of the unjust
But He has blessed the 
habitation of the just
Hearken unto Me now, Oh ye 
children
And attending to the words of My 
Mouth

Violence covereth the mouth of 
the unjust
But blessings are upon the head 
of the just
Jesus is saying hearken now 
unto Me oh ye children
And attend to the words of My 
mouth"
1686;THEN JESUS CAME;D;"Remember the time in your life
When nothing seemed to be 
going right
You needed a friend to with you 
to the end
But no help seemed to be in 
sight
The burden of life just seemed to 
get you down
Perplexed but yet not forsaken
Then you reached out from your 
heart unto the Lord
Then suddenly He appeared to 
show you someone cared

CHORUS
Then Jesus came
The Unchangeable God in an 
unexpected time
The Jesus came
Who knows what it takes
To put the Bride in rapturing 
condition
Just call Him on the scene

When you look all around
The barrel of meal seems to be 
going down
And the cruse of oil just seems to 
lose its flow
Just hang in there my friend, 
God's only testing you
Just to see what you will do
And when you know you've done 
all that you can do
Sovereign Grace will always 
come and see you through
Just seek ye first His kingdom, 
and all other things my friend, 
will be added unto you

I remember one time with Peter 
and the disciples
Who were taking a long boat ride 
in the night
Testifying of the love He showed
And how everywhere He went 
He was doing good
Then suddenly the winds began 
to blow
And the sea began to roar
There was fear all around
For a moment there, it seemed 
like all was gone"
1687;THE TRIAL;C;"My soul becomes sorrowful as 
I foresee an evil day
Lord what must I say
Shall this cup pass away 
But here am I in your footsteps
Lord your son
To this end was I born,
So let Thy will be done

CHORUS
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord
My soul shall be joyful in my God
For He has clothed me 
With His garments of salvation
He has covered me
With His robes of righteousness

I'm forsaken and rejected 
And I'm judged by evil men
Shall I protest in defense, 
or in anger be tense
When I stand in disgrace
May Lord I behold your dear face
And may this vision I share
Till I see the glory of your name

When I'm pressed out, seem 
defeated
In the eyes of wicked men
Shall you deliver me and my full 
inheritance
When you strike me I will speak
And command creation again
Then the faces of my accusers
Will be greatly ashamed"
1688;TRIALS AND TRIALS;G;"There are somethings I learnt in 
this life
That I want to share with you
Never think yourself to be 
something
When you are nothing
It's like taking your finger out of 
the water
And trying to find the place again 
Always remember that He is the 
Vine
And we are the branches

CHORUS
Trials and harder trials were sent 
to mold and make us
Many times we may not 
understand
But it was not meant for us to
Trials and harder trials were sent 
to mold and make us
So that we'll be careful to give 
Him
All honour and all glory too

Paul said, daily I bring myself 
under subjection
Least I myself be a castaway 
unto destruction
So every day we must give Him 
praise
Cause He alone is worthy
To receive honour and all glory

Therefore we both labour and 
suffer reproach
Cause we trust in the Living God
Who is the Saviour of all men
But tribulation worketh patience
And patience brings experience
And experience brings hope
And hope maketh not ashamed"
1689;TRIED BY THE WORD OF…;D;"Here I am in prison bound by 
chains of iron
Can't think my own thoughts, 
can't do my own thing
But I know it's all in God's 
predestinated plan
For the vision is yet for an 
appointed time
But in a little while it shall speak
So I'll just be patient while His 
will I seek

CHORUS
Even though I'm tried by the 
Word of the Lord
I'm bound to 'thus saith the Lord'
I'll stand on my watch just to see
What He will say unto me
Though the vision tarries, 
I'll wait for it
Though it lingers, 
I'll exercise patience
For through faith and patience
I shall inherit the promise

I'm living in a world of gross 
darkness
Where the sun refuses to shine
And where the stars refuse to 
give their light
But though this whole world be 
shaken all around me
I know I'll never be moved
For I stand on holy ground

Because we have kept the Word 
of His patience 
He'll also keep us from 
temptation
In this evil generation
For the promise is sure to all the 
seed
And greater is He that is in me
Than He that is in the world"
1690;WHO AM I;Em;"Who am I? I once wondered

always wrong

Why am I acquainted with grief 
and pain
I have forsaken iniquity, yet the

They ask where is your God times }2x

But I've been told, that I'm a

Bound in chains to do the Will of 
Love Divine

I've already overcome, and   }

brethren
Oh, to dwell together in unity

That we are His Bride
By the love we show, love that 
can't hide
And we will walk with each other; 
we'll walk hand in hand
Exhorting one another as the 
days go by.

No man lighteth a candle 
And put it under a bushel
But he sets it on high for all eyes 
to see
So we must love one another, 
not just in words or tongue
But in thoughts and deeds."
1692;WATCHMAN;D;"Watchman, Watchman, What of 
the night?
Watchman, Watchman,
Morning cometh with the night 
(Repeat)

You have proclaimed the 
acceptable Year of the Lord
And you're now declaring the 
Day of Vengeance of Our God
You shall be given the Garment 
of Praise
For the spirit of heaviness 
Yea, for my people shall be 
called
Trees of righteousness.

The wicked have drawn iniquity
With cords of vanity 
Righteous have drawn life
And are bound to Eternity
Fading sorrow in my eyes, I will 
not spare nor have pity
Yea, for my watchman have 
declared
My abundant mercy.

Rejoice in Zion, ye Mighty men 
of valor
Although for a little while, you 
have to suffer
My rugged sons and daughters
You can't fail
Why, the Lion of the tribe of 
Judah
He has prevailed.

You shall be called Priests of the 
Lord 
And men shall call you, Ministers 
of your God
You shall rule the nations, with a 
rod of iron
My beloved, you will share my 
throne
Upon Mount Zion."
1693;CHRIST IS THE MYSTERY OF…;G;"Christ is the mystery of God 
revealed 
In you and me (in you and me)
Christ is the mystery of God 
revealed
In you and me (in you and me)

We have seen god in His son
When said ""little fishie, God gave 
you back you're your life
Peace be still 
Storm go back from whence you 
came""
We have seen God in creation 
In the sun, the moon and the stars
But now let us see God,
Let us see God in His people

We have heard how he spoke a 
word
And squirrels did appear 
And by His word the sun and the 
moon stood still
We have heard how by His love
He stopped the raging bull
Turned back the wild hornets 
But now let us see God
Let us see God in His people

We have seen God in His Word
In the Masterpiece, Who Do You 
Say This Is
There's a Man here that can turn 
on the Light
He That Is In You
We have seen God in the eagle
And the gentleness of the Dove
But now let us see God
Let us see God in His people"
1694;WHY IT HAD TO BE SHEPHERDS;G;"CHORUS
Tell me why it had to be 
shepherds
Why it had to be shepherds
This great mystery of 
Redemption
It was locked up, in shepherd 
and sheep

From Genesis to Revelation
Men's lives revealed God's 
mystery by their occupation
Humble herdsmen hastening 
with the greatest message
The Messiah is on the earth right 
now
Behold they bring you tidings of 
great joy
In Bethlehem is where you will 
find him

It was Abel who first caught the 
revelation
Of this great mystery of 
Redemption
Found out the only place that 
God would meet him
It was under the shed blood of 
an innocent lamb
A lamb without spot and without 
blemish
Was the only thing that could 
have redeemed him

Our Great Shepherd and Bishop
of our soul 
Has come to lead and guide us 
along the road
We as sheep are helpless 
without Him
He'll shed light to us when the 
way gets dim 
With the staff of the Seventh 
Seal, He has opened up the way 
back to Eden 
And with the sling shot of prayer 
and faith
We'll possess all our enemy's 
gates."
1695;YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN;C;"You are not your own, you are 
not your own
You were bought with a price
Yes His blood was shed
For you He was the Supreme 
Sacrifice
No animal's blood was truly ever 
able to atone
The requirement was Blood that 
carried higher life
The Lord Jesus met it.

Present your body as a living 
sacrifice
Which would be your reasonable 
service
All your thoughts and your 
innermost desire
Be unto Him
For you are your own, you are 
not your own
The Lord Jesus bought you

Which man taking thought could 
add one cubit to his stature
All the efforts that you make
Will always end in failure
Willingly lay down your own life
That in Him you'll find new life 
again
For you are not your own, you 
are not your own
The Lord Jesus bought you

Harvest time has come and God 
requires pre-eminence
Fully surrendered unto God
A man becomes omnipotent
When two omnipotent would meet
Then the miraculous takes place
So let go and let God, let go and 
let God
Have His own way.

Present your body as a living 
sacrifice 
All of your thoughts and your 
innermost desire
Your eyes, your arms, your feet
Must be surrendered unto Him
For you are not your own, you 
are not your own
The Lord Jesus bought you 
For you are not your own, you 
are not your own
The Lord Jesus bought you."
1696;THE RACE THAT'S SET…;F;"As a runner that's being trained
To run the greatest race of all 
time
I want to lay aside each weight 
and sin
So I won't be left behind
I want to run with a motive
With a desire in my soul 
And I won't look back for 
anything
I'll keep my eyes steadfast on my 
Goal

I will run for the prize
Which no man could ever give
I'll contend for eternal life 
sublime
I will run with my eyes steadfast
On the promises of God's Word
I'll stay true to all the rules I've 
Heard

Any man who strives for the 
mastery
Great hardness he must endure
We must press with all that's 
within us
We must cry out Lord just once 
more
For the race is not for the 
swiftest
But we are chosen to endure
To receive a crown of 
righteousness
God's promise to you will be sure

The author and the finisher
Is Jesus Christ our Lord
Who despised the shame 
endured the Cross
And is set down on the right 
hand of God
I'll consider Him who has 
endured
Such opposition against Himself
Lest I be weary and faint in my 
Mind

…Just remember
The author and the finisher
Is Jesus Christ Our Lord"
1697;WE GOT LOVE…;D;"As it is in the beginning
So shall it be in the end, in the 
end
Bridegroom and Bride together
Reigning with one another in 
Eden

CHORUS
Cause we got love, we got love
We got love, oh sweet love, we 
got love.
And by this the world will know 
By the love we show, by the love 
we show
Cause a new commandment He 
gave unto us
That we love one another
As He hath loved us
As He hath loved us.

We must always consider each 
other
Provoking one another unto love, 
unto love
The Prophet prophesied about 
us
He said it would be a revival of 
the just,
Of the just."
1698;GOD'S ELECTIVE LOVE;F;"You loved me when I was so 
unlovable
You died for me when I wasn't 
worth dying for
You taught me real godliness is 
with contentment
And my trials only come to give 
me patience
Truly Your way's not like our ways
And Your thoughts are not like 
our thoughts
But You chip and You mold us
To bring us into Your image

CHORUS
Truly Your love is not parental 
care for a baby
But Your love truly is elective 
love
You may cause us to suffer like 
Job
Or be delivered unto death like 
Paul
Buy yet in it all You're proving to 
us
How much You really, really, 
really love us

You told me when I'm weak then 
I'm strong
And the only way up is down
In order to receive from Thee I 
must give
And to live in Your presence I 
must die

I thought that after my failures 
You would depart
But Your love keeps burning and 
burning in my heart
You are determined to show that 
Your love
Is stronger that my will 
And that Your election is 
stronger than my sins"
1699;IT'S AN INSIDE LIFE;D;"I used to sit and wonder
Where I came from and where I 
am going
The question remained 
unanswered
Deep in my heart
But I pondered it deep within
And then one day I heard a 
familiar voice
That came and revealed my 
strange life to me
It told me all the mysteries of my 
life
Was sealed up right inside of me

CHORUS
It's an inside life
That just keeps growing
From glory unto glory
It's and inside life 
With which I have nothing to do
But it just keeps pushing its way 
through
It tells me where I'm going
Makes it real and oh, so simple
It's a law that is irreversible

Now the only God I will ever 
know
Is the God inside of me
That brought me from darkness 
to His light
That rushed me from 
blasphemous names
To His provided place
Where I received my sight
Like a farmer that plants a seed 
into the ground
But he never adds to that seed
For all the potentials and law of 
life
Is sealed up inside of that seed"
1700;I'VE GOT SOMETHING;G;"Sometimes I sit and wonder
About the evil all around me
Why people ridicule my faith
When I believe what I cannot see
But the Holy Ghost, Sweet Jesus 
Came and ministered to my soul
He revealed some sweetsounding words
That restored and made me 
whole

CHORUS
I've got something that the world 
can't take away
I've got something and it's with 
me night and day
I've got something worth talking 
about
It makes me sing and it makes 
me shout
I've got something and the world 
can't take it away

I was in denomination a-thirsting 
in my soul
Looking for a message to restore 
and make me whole
Then I went to Barataria, I heard 
the rainbow mystery
A prophet with a message to set 
the captive free

I was fussing and deliberating
A war down in my soul
Should I accept this message 
and gave God full control
God's mysteries being revealed
I gave my heart to Jesus, and my 
destiny was sealed

Now let me tell you something
About this sweet Lord that I've 
found
It makes me feel so happy 
knowing Jesus is around
It talks about salvation, about the 
Lamb upon the throne
Now I am so happy I'll never be 
alone"
1701;THE INVISIBLE UNION;F;"Love called me out of this world
Revealed I was His very own
Showed me things that was, is 
and is to be
His thoughts of me eternally

CHORUS
Said your life's not your own
You've been bought with a price 
- my life
Sent here to prepare
The marriage of the Lamb and 
His wife

How could I have ever known
The full extent of God's great 
love
Alienated from His economy
By the fruit of the forbidden tree

Oh the depth of the riches
Both of the wisdom and 
knowledge of God
It took a separation
To wrought the invisible union 
with my Lord

I've found a pearl of great price
Can't imagine this world ever did 
look nice
Truly great things happen in 
silence
I now have the mind of Christ

The prodigal son has returned
From the Potter's house of love
Fellowship has been restored
On the Lamb has descended on 
the Dove"
1702;WHAT DOES HE MEAN TO YOU;C;"The world is falling apart again, 
with trouble on every hand
In this evil day of germ warfare, 
diseases throughout the land
Fearful thoughts are blowing in 
the air
Causing the faithless hearts to 
be running to and fro
In such a crucial time, when no 
one on earth can help you
What does Jesus, the Revealed 
Word, mean to you now
What does Jesus, the Revealed 
Word, mean to you now

He's the One who said I'll heal all 
your diseases
He's the Rock, and He's the 
Anchor of my soul
He's my Helper. He's my North 
Star, the One I'm tied to
That's what Jesus, the Revealed 
Word means to me now
What does Jesus, the Revealed 
Word, mean to you now

We can feel the hot air of 
judgement blowing hotter every 
day
And as the earth continues 
shaking very soon it will fall away
No one can deny those trumpets 
made it plain
It is the wrath of God, He's 
pouring out on sin
Pollution has filled the earth and 
sky and sea
Causing the sun and moon to be 
blacked out totally
There is on place on earth where 
we can safely be
He's the Fourth Man who walked 
into the fiery furnace
When things get dark He said, 
Fear not, I'll turn on the Light
He's my Shield that gives me 
safety down in Goshen
That's what Jesus the revealed 
Word means to me now

What does Jesus the revealed 
Word mean to you now
The cry of famine is everywhere, 
men's hearts failing for fear
Those hideous sights that the 
Prophet saw, every day we seem 
to face
The hearts of men once again 
are continually evil 
They are carrying out their plans 
to destroy the earth
Violence fills every nation under 
heaven
One of the flashing red light, the 
sign to the end of the world
He's my shelter when the earth 
is set on fire
He's the Voice that will call my 
loved ones from the grave
He is my wings that will bear me 
over to that city
That's what Jesus the revealed 
Word means to you now

What does Jesus the Revealed 
Word mean to you now
Darkness covers the earth, the 
sign in the heaven the Lord did 
send
We all can see it's very plain that 
judgement is on the land
Be sure you have already 
applied the Token
It's the only thing that can stay 
the wrath of God
For all the fashions and kingdom 
of this world will pass away
Only the Son of Man, the 
revealed Word will stay
Only the Son of Man, the 
revealed Word will stay
For He is the Rock that'll smite 
the image on its ten toes
It is Him we'll crown King of 
kings and Lord of lords
When the judgement passes I'll 
still be standing like an Easter 
flower
That's what Jesus the revealed 
Word means to me now
What does Jesus the revealed 
Word mean to you now

He's the One who said I'll heal all 
your diseases
He's the Fourth Man who walked 
into the fiery furnace
He's my Shelter when the earth 
is set on fire
He's the Rock that'll smite the 
image on its ten toes
What does Jesus the revealed 
Word mean to you now
What does Jesus the revealed 
Word mean to you now"
1703;PREDESTINATED;D;"Life has its ups and downs and 
heartaches
Enough to blow your mind
So many are going insane
With the rapid changes of time 
But it's good to know your 
anchor holds
In this troubled and perplexed 
world
For the greatest peace that you 
have
Is to know that out of a million
God has chosen you to be His 
Own

CHORUS
For we are predestinated
To come into His image 
We are predestinated
To be transformed in His Word
We are predestinated unto glory
So no matter what comes and 
goes
We are predestinated to be His 
Word

You might have a lot of mistakes 
and failures
But that doesn't make God 
change His mind
I'm not giving any credit to sin 
now
But I'm only confessing His Word
For whom He choose He'll never 
lose
Whom He ordained no man 
could gain
O what an eternal security 
I just want to praise Him for all 
eternity"
1704;WHERE IS THE LOVE;C;"Lord you called me out of dark 
denomination
You said, 'Come out of her, my 
child' and I followed
But in my heart I know there's 
something missing
Lord I want to see Your Word 
living through me

CHORUS
Where is the love
Where is the Dove of Agape love
Where is the love
Where is that unconditional love
Where is the love
I need a baptism of Your love
I need Your love

Though I may speak with the 
tongue of men and of angels
And though I may understand all 
the mysteries
And even with the faith to move 
a mountain
Without the love of God in me I 
am nothing

The darkness hovering over 
God's little Bride
It will all be pushed away by the 
sunlight
The light of the glorious gospel is 
risen in her
What are you going to do with 
this Jesus called Christ"
1705;HALLELUJAH;C;"We are the children of God
Chosen vessels unto Him
Our angels behold the Father's 
face
We are special unto Him
We should never be ashamed
To testify of our love for Him
For we are privileged
To be the children of the King of 
kings

CHORUS
Hal-le-lu-jah
Glory and praise to the Saviour
Hal-le-lu-jah
Let's worship our King together
Hal-le-lu-jah
Glory and praise to the Saviour
Hal-le-lu-jah
Let's worship our King together

We must dwell in unity
So we show our love to Him
Having a blameless testimony
A life that's holy and free from 
sin
We should be an example
To the lost who know not the 
way
We're not children of the night 
but of the day 

With the joy of the Lord
And the strength of our youth
Let's be zealous to do God's will
Fleeing youthful lusts and 
pressing to be
Empty vessels that God can fill
We should d never lean to our 
own understanding
Casting our reasoning down
So we'll be better able to love 
and serve Him"
1706;LET US ALL BE READY;C;"Let us all be ready when He 
comes for us
Dressed in the wedding gown of 
His righteousness
Flashing the wedding band of 
His grace
And veiled with His Holy Spirit of 
Promise

CHORUS
For soon we will see Him face to 
face
When He comes to catch His 
waiting Bride away
Then we will take our flight thru 
the skies
To take us away to our future 
Home

Let us all keep pressing our way 
through
Despite what others might say or 
do
Holding fast to His promise that 
He'll soon return
To take us away to our future 
Home

Down here we have no 
continuing city 
But we seek one to come
A city whose builder and maker 
is God
A city where we'll never grow old"
1707;VICTORY IN CONSECRATION;F;"Get thee down, get by the brook
On the inside now take a look
You have taken My Word, 
declared it publicly
Now it's time for another turn
There's a brook where you must 
go and hide
You have many things to learn
I've commanded ravens to feed 
you there
So you have no need to fear
Just prepare yourself for the new 
ministry 
That is coming up ahead
The creating of the meal and oil
And the raising of the dead

Now that you, you're left alone
Here's your chance to overcome
For all your years you've lived, 
you have not submitted
All your will to me
You've tried to be brave, but now 
you're still afraid 
Of your greatest enemy
But I've touched your strength, 
the hollow of your thigh
On it you can no more rely
Let me go, I say, for soon the 
day will break
Soon it will be morning light
I have changed your name you'll 
not be the same 
I have given you new life

So arise! Thou mighty man
You shall smite them as one man
For I've commanded you, to 
break your idols down
Erect an altar in its stead
And upon it lay your inwards, 
outwards
Your feet and your head
And thought the people be 
thousands, out of all of them
I just need three hundred men
Each with empty pitchers with 
lamps inside
And a trumpet in their hands
And at your trump they'll blow 
and shout

The Sword of the Lord and Gideon
So arise! Thou mighty man
Get thee down at My command
So arise! Thou might man
All alone with me you'll stand
So arise! Thou mighty man
You shall smite them as one man
At My command"
1708;THE LOVE WE NEED SO…;C;"Lord Your love to me is so 
wonderful
It passes the love of humans
And it lifted me from all my sins
And I know You love me with 
unfailing love

CHORUS
Love, the love of God we need 
so much
Love produces faith
Love is God and God, He is love
Love, the love of God we need 
so much

Love and faith go together
Without God's love there is no 
faith
Perfect faith is pure, just as pure 
love
And God's love takes away my 
Unbelief

For God who is rich in mercy 
For His great love wherewith He 
loves me
And I love Him till I want 
His will to be done in my life
And His love has no fear

Calvary is the love of God 
expressed
Seven Seals revealed God's love 
to us
It shows us the love of God
Before the beginning
And I know His love has no end"
1709;THIS IS THE DAY;Am;"I said I'll return, and since that 
time
You have been watching for Me
Longing for the day, when I 
would come to take you home
You are the one I chose to be My 
bride
And I have prepared a place
For I need you by My side
And this is the day, this is the 
Day

Shining like the sun
There is no one as beautiful as 
you
And none can take your place
Your virtues they do not possess
This was all planned, long before 
the world began
At the end of the ages
I'll come and take your hand
And this is the day, this is the 
Day

I am yours and you are Mine
All is said and done
Angels sing, and they rejoice
Now that the two are made one

Come, come take My hand
And I will lead you all the way to 
glory
Time shall be no more
So I'll spend eternity with you
I've loved you before
And you know I love you now
I'll love you forever
I'll never break my vow
And this is the day, this is the 
day"
1710;REACHING OUT FOR THOSE;D;"My Lord took me out of this world
And justified me by faith
Cleansed my mind and my soul 
by His grace
Turned my atmosphere heavenly
So I could worship Him 
But I long to hear, 'this is my 
beloved son
In whom I'm well pleased to 
dwell'

CHORUS
Reaching out for those things 
which are before me
Reaching out for those things 
which lie ahead
I can't stop now
Least I come short of the 
promise
So I'm reaching out for those 
things 
Which lie ahead

For I'm just not satisfied being 
justified
I'm just not satisfied being 
sanctified
For the promise of this age is 
Adopted sons in His image
So I must keep pressing day by 
day
Until I reach that stage

For the hour has come
When the Token must be on 
display
All that Christ was, in His bride 
will be manifested
The former and the latter rain
Will bring the seed to maturity 
again
So why should I settle for second 
best
When the sky is full of the real 
Thing

Reaching out for those things 
which are before me
Pressing with all that is within me 
I can't stop now
'Lest I come short of the promise
So I'm reaching out for those 
things 
Which lie ahead"
1711;WALKING ON THE WATERS;A;"I lifted my sight and hoisted my 
sails
To sail life's great sea
With the devil on my trail
He troubled my waters, rocked 
my ship from side to side
It almost covered me
When I looked out in the 
distance, I saw the Master of the 
sea

CHORUS
He came walking on the waters 
that almost covered me
From a distance I could see Him
Walking on my troubled sea
With outstretched hands He 
beckoned 
He said 'child come follow Me
Now I'm walking on the waters 
that almost covered me

The storm clouds rose and 
became so dark
And clouded the atmosphere
The waves began to stand so tall
To bring me doubt and fear
My troubles became so great
I knew I could not make it on my 
own
Then He rolled back the mist that 
I could see
He sent the Dove to lead me 
Home

The devil, he tried to drown me
So that he could take control
When he saw he did not get me 
He tried destroying me from the 
world
But my Saviour said, 'Fear not, 
my child 
I've already prayed for you
I have set the boundaries of the 
seas
He said, it cannot cover you

Now I'm walking on the sea
I've learnt to keep my eyes on 
Him
My burdens bother me no more
For He gave me peace within
The waters that once had me 
down are what I'm walking on
For I know I'm not alone
I'm with the Master of the sea"
1712;WHAT SHALL SEPARATE ME;Cm;"I was out there in the barnyard
Searching for my rightful place
I had this feeling deep inside me 
As those other birds around me 
Scratching and picking in the dirt
Them mama cried out 'You're 
not a chicken
You're an eagle from your birth.'

Now what shall separate me 
From the love of Jesus Christ
Shall tribulation or persecution
Or distress or famine time
No not height nor depth nor 
nakedness
Nor peril, neither sword
For I'm persuaded that there is 
nothing
Absolutely nothing
That can separate me
From the love of God in Christ

My former life was not the 
answer
It could not quench the thirst 
inside
But there must be some better way
My soul to satisfy 
Then one day my life was 
changed 
A gift that money cannot buy
From an ugly caterpillar- to a 
Butterfly

I was delivered into a strange land
As a prisoner bound in chains
I never knew that royal blood 
Was flowing in my veins
Then I received a special 
Message
What a freedom it did bring
When I found out that I'm not a slave 
But I'm a child of The King"
1713;INNER VEIL;C;"I am tired of failing and I don't 
like fear
But Lord I want to be more

I want to be that perfect man that 
You called me to be
I know there's a will inside of my 
heart
To separate from the cares of 
this life
To sever from all those things in 
my life
That has kept us apart

CHORUS
For I want to soar the heights of 
Your love
So I'm moving within the inner 
well
Where the glories never fall
Your Shekinah glory 
Living in Your August presence
I want to soar the heights of Your 
Love

Lord I don't want this to just be a 
song
But a prayer from my heart
For You're looking for that 
perfect sacrifice
A sweet-smelling savour
A life in which You are pleased 
to dwell
To display all your attributes
May You be the principal theme 
of my life
A life that You can use

You called me to a life of 
intimacy
A true relationship with Thee
So I'm moving into that little 
room
Where You said You'd meet me
For I know if I abide in You
And Your Word abide in me
Then I could ask You what I will
And I know that it will be given"
1714;JESUS STILL HEALS;Ab;"I've got something that I want to 
share with somebody
Though many might say
What I have to say is an old, old 
story
But though you've heard it many 
times before
It's still real to me
So I just want to let you know 
again

CHORUS
Jesus still heals, Jesus still 
saves
Jesus still mends a broken heart
He still forgives, even though
You're burdened with sin
Jesus still restores a broken life

So my friend, don't you ever 
Let it get to common to you
For that's what's the matter
With so many people 
They've heard it so many times 
before
That it just don't seem real 
Anymore

We are eyewitnesses of His 
majesty
We see Him performing in our 
midst daily
He's no longer history
But He's still real today
As He was yesterday

Jesus still heals, He still loves 
you
He still could mend a broken 
heart
He still gives power, to overcome 
in any hour
Jesus still restores a broken life"
1715;GOD'S POWER AND…;A;"Peter, James and John
Faith, Hope and Charity
Were eyewitnesses of His 
Majesty
They were given a dress 
rehearsal
Of His second coming
When He would come in Power 
and glory

CHORUS
We're living by His Dunamis
In the time of His Perusia
There's overcoming power
In this atmosphere

He said He will come again
And the world will not see Him
But our eyes will behold Him 
In all His splendor
We will be like Him
We'll be fashioned in His 
likeness
A robe of white 
And we'll be in all our glory

Now Dunamis is His power
That we're living by daily
That will help us to overcome 
In this treacherous hour
Perusia is His appearing
When He shall come as a thief in 
the night
So be watching, don't let no man 
Steal your garment
But be shining bright"

We have the Message, for this 
last Age
The signs are pointing clear, to 
that glad day
This is the latter rain, the Bride is 
called
We are gathering here on earth 
to meet the Lord

O Bridegroom come, our hearts 
do really hunger
This troubled place on earth we 
can bear no longer
We'll change to meet Him in 
heaven above
Our bodies to immortal- just like 
the Lord's

Oh Praise His Precious Name, 
Oh Praise the Lord
We'll change our image soon, to 
meet our God
We'll sing Hosannas, at the 
Marriage Feast
The Saints of Yester-year, we all 
shall meet

They were waiting for 
Now when I see us gathered in 
Abel country
Reviewing forty years of history
And we see how we have come
All the battles that we have won
We are God's mighty marching army
Seven compound redemptive 
names of our great Jehovah
He has been revealing unto us
We are led by the Dove onto 
perfect love
And we are holding our palms in 
our hands"
1717;LET THERE BE JOY;Gm;"8 O bless our God, ye people, 
and make the voice of his praise 
to be heard:
9 Which holdeth our soul in life, 
and suffereth not our feet to be 
moved.
10 For thou, O God, hast proved 
us: thou hast tried us, as silver is 
tried.
11 Thou broughtest us into the 
net; thou laidst affliction upon our 
loins.
12 Thou hast caused men to ride 
over our heads; we went through 
fire and through water: but thou 
broughtest us out into a wealthy 
place.

Wasn't it love that caused our 
Lord to die?
Oh what love 
He loves you and I ?
Streams of grace, 
Our debt He paid 
Our resurrected Christ in our 
midst today??

CHORUS?
Let there be joy in the house of 
The Lord (Hallelujah)
Let there be faith in the house of 
the Lord?
Let there be healing in the house 
of The Lord
For what He has done??

Now The Lord is causing us His 
Bride?
To look back forty (40) years has 
passed us by?
What a might work the Lord has 
done?
So many lives have been 
revived.??

Like the children of Israel?
Many were born along the way
Showers of Revelation poured 
out in our day?
Because of the Shepherd God 
has put to lead the way

And our God has brought us to 
this place 
Where we are now It's His 
amazing grace?
Around the world The Word, has 
gone near and far 
A people chosen to walk this 
path"
1718;CHECK YOURSELF;G;"It's so easy to say 
That you're walking
In truth today
But are you really
Reflecting the image of Christ

CHORUS
And now, check yourself 
In the mirror of the word
And be sure 
That your walk is true
Ask the saviour to help you
And to make himself a part of 
You

For we all must be ready 
To meet him when he comes 
And to hear come up hither
To the place prepared for you

1719;THE SOUL'S CRY;Em;"I may be mocked and scorned
By this whole world
Just like my Jesus was.
I may be hunted down or even 
persecuted,
But its okay, once I have the 
Holy Spirit.
I know this world will reject me,
And my own friends may despise 
me,
But that's okay…..yes that's 
okay.
I'm not here for these purposes,
I'm about my Father's will,
And my greatest desire,
Is for the fullness of Him, 
To be found in me; when He 
returns that day.

CHORUS
So I'm crying out
For Your Holy Spirit
It makes no sense for my 
existence without It.
I'm crying out 
For Your Holy Spirit
More of You is what I need for 
without You I can not live,
I need You Lord….
I'm desperate for You Lord.

Lord I speak about change, from 
this old body,
But I know I will never see these 
things if You're not within me.
So I'm here on my knees, crying 
Jesus please fill me
'cause when I see how You 
could take a broken vessel
And mold it into Your image Lord...
I lay my life down before Thee
Because I know my soul You can 
preserve
Lord if You take me and You 
mold me into Your word.
Then I will know that I can make 
it, for sure
'cause I will have Your Holy 
Spirit within me....
It will be a daily walk with You

1720;OUT OF TIME INTO…;Fm;"Storms of life are raging 
Gross darkness fills the earth
There's strife among the nations
Pestilence and famine
And wars on every hand
Violence sweeps through the lands
But the Word of our Lord 
Reveals a place of refuge
Where the righteous can run and 
be saved
When we're under the blood 
The death angel can't slay us
We'll be safe till we're taken away

CHORUS
In a moment we'll be gone
We'll be taken from this world
Out of time into eternity
Out of darkness into light
Out of death into life
Out of time into eternity

Chaos and confusion
Men's hearts are filled with fear
As terror strikes around them
Despite all the destruction
They still cling to worldly cares
They keep living in despair
But the children of God
Abides in peace and safety
Far away from the oncoming storms
In the cleft of the Rock
We are completely sheltered
As we wait for the last trump to 
Sound

BRIDGE
There's come a time
When the Spirit of God will depart
Then none shall be healed none 
shall be saved
This world is again falling apart 
as our Prophet said
So enter in now before it is too late

No more darkness only light
No more death only life
Out of time into eternity
Spread your wings prepare for flight
Faster than the speed of light 
Out of time into eternity"

But with the armor of the Lord
And with the two edged sword

That showed him he'd be well

staggered not through unbelief
Trouble was only six inches long
From beginning to end faith 
looks to the end of the Lord

I'm part of a people today
That's walking in that same faith
Amidst conditions and

We confess God's word
The symtoms that we see
Are only lying vanities
But God's promise is sure to all 
His seed
We'll walk into complete victory

A fervent desire to please you

I've heard about great riches untold
Awaiting me in glory
And yes I'd love to see these things
But most importantly
I long to see the One who died 
for me

CHORUS
I long to see Jesus, Jesus
The one who gives me strength 
and courage
To keep pressing on
Jesus, the One who loved me 
When I did not deserve to be loved
Jesus means the most to me

Wars and strife on every hand
Disasters everywhere
People living in misery
Men's hearts fail for fear
And yet in this confusion
I have a settled peace
Because Jesus said He's coming 
back
He's coming back for me
And every day I'm longing
Just to look upon the face 
Of the One who gave His life for me
And saved me by His grace.

Now every day I'm walking
With the consciousness of mind
That any day I'll be caught away 
In the twinkling of an eye
I can feel my Saviour 
He is coming so close
Administering and entrance
Into a parallel universe
He's decrypting the secrets
To immortality
Lifting me up from this earthly realm
Into the realm of the heavenly

Yet still we had fears, doubts, 
amnesia and unbelief

done with faith we can speak let

Who can deny God's goings in 
this sanctuary?
Supernatural manifestations from 
Fran street down to Abel country
At the holy cross God's servant 
was commissioned to preach to 
the lost
And there came a bride from 
every nation, regionally and 
internationally
Yes each one of us positionally 
placed in our ministry

But now we hunger Lord for a 
revival in our souls
We can't go on living as we have 
done before

We've come to companies of 
angels, 
To the general assembly, 
To the church of the firstborn, 
Which are written in sky.

Sealed with the Holy Spirit, 
The Token in our life.

Oh how close to immortality 
We have come this very hour. 
By the holy calling we're called 
Not by works, by grace and mercy 
Granted in His power.

Are you walking in the Light of

Are your eyes anointed this way? 
For the Light of the Word has come, 
And we can feed on the Tree of Life.

We have victory over sin, 
Shining with this Light!

That for His Kingdom by His grace 
my life could succeed
About my Father's business.
It's my Land and indeed $ I will 
possess it!

Give me that mountain, Moses, now
I'm ready for the fight
I don't rely on strength of men, but 
God who is inside
He will fulfill all He has promised 
me with no delay
I hear Him calling my Name

The third pull ministry now lives 
and works inside of me
The Seal of God is in my heart 
pulsating mightily
And the anointing of the eagle gives 
me victory
So I could fly in the Heavenlies.

When we fully trust Him and

Life under Headship
Is the Life that God lives through us 
in His Own way.

Little boy brought those two fishes 
and fives loaves of bread
Little did he know how much this 
sacrifice had meant
Jesus took the offered gifts into 
Creative Hand
By the little loaves and fishes were 
the thousands fed.

All diversities of gifts are given 
from above 
They are an expression of the 
attributes of God
Even if a mustard seed, just give it 
to the Lord, 
He can grow exceeding harvest 
thriving ever more."

I'm so full of It tonight.

This outpouring on the Bride comes 
down like mighty Shower,
I won't let It pass me by,

our glorious Heavenly place.

1. God revealed it to us and we 
recognized our day and hour.
It's the harvest time, latter rain is

That God keeps it under control.
He knows it all, molding me and 
forming
On the Potter's Wheel of Christ, the

Wondrous are Your works, o Lord.
How I want to soar with You,
Long to see You in plain view.

You anointed me,
Delivered from blindness
So that I could see
The expression of Your 
lovingkindness,
Your master plan, Your redemption

In my infirmities then will I glory,

the deepest pond,

The Message touched my heart,
And from the muck of doctrines 
pulled me out.

behold, 
Whose Glory I desire to unfold,
I am not bound to this world at all. 
I'm going where the Lamb of God
Is Light forevermore - He's the 
Source of Life within my soul.

2. God revealed the fullness of His 
Word today,
Wisdom of this world can not 
receive It, but we choose God's

Placing them against the winds
Full of love she answers to her boy:

And we just want to say until
We won't say goodbye

CHORUS 2
We'll see you again
When the last trump sounds 
And the dead in Christ appear
But until that moment
You'll live inside our hearts
With God given assurance

We know we'll see you again
(We'll be reunited)
We know we'll see you again

Beautiful lily
We'll see you again"
1763;THANK YOU LORD;D;"When I think about the grace and 
love
You have so graciously 
Bestowed on me
When I fell from eternity
You left your throne in glory
To seek and save me
You died upon the cross
You restored everything that I lost
Now with a heart of sincerity
And appreciation

CHORUS
Thank You Lord
For Your unconditional love
It was nothing I could have done
You just loved me 
Amazing grace and mercy
I don't deserve this love
I don't deserve this mercy
That You've bestowed on me

Your love for me 
Passes all my understanding
I see the many times when I have 
failed
But yet oh Lord Your love prevails
And You keep lifting me 
I thank You for Your elective love
Your unconditional covenant
You have redeemed me
I could never be lost

BRIDGE
Just to think I'm one in a million
Chosen by you
To be your Bride
You made me a joint heir with you
It overwhelms me 
To think You'd choose one like me
Your unconditional love is all I see"
1764;GIVE THEM ALL;;"Are you tired of chasing 
pretty rainbows
Are you tired of spinning round 
and round
Wrap up all the shattered dreams 
of your life
And at the feet of Jesus lay 
them down

Give them all (give them all)
Give them all (give them all.)
Give them all to Jesus
Shattered dreams, wounded hearts, 
broken toys
Give them all (give them all)
Give them all (give them all.)
Give them all to Jesus
And he will turn your sorrows into joy

He never said you'd only see 
sunshine
He never said there'd be no rain
He only promised us a heart
full of singing
That's the very thing that once 
brought pain"

CHORUS
I love Jesus, hallelujah!
I love Jesus, yes, I do,
I love Jesus, He's my Savior;
Jesus smiles and loves me too.

I will tell you what induced me.
In the glorious fight to start:
'Twas the Savior's loving-kindness
Overcame and won my heart.

When I first commenced my warfare,
Many said, ""she'll run away"";
But their words have been unfounded
In the fight I am today.

I'm ""a wonder"" unto many, 
God alone the change has wrought;
Here I raise my Ebenezer,
Hither by His help I'm brought.

When to death's dark, swelling river,
Like a warrior I shall come,
Then I mean to shout ""Salvation!""
And go singing ""glory!"" home."
1766;LORD YOU SEEM FAR AWAY;;"Lord, You seem so far away
A million miles or more, it feels today
And though I haven't lost my faith
I must confess right now
That it's hard for me to pray
But I don't know what to say
And I don't know where to start
But as You give the grace
With all that's in my heart

CHORUS
I will sing, yes, I will praise, even in my 
darkest hour
Through the sorrow and the pain
I will sing, I will praise, lift my hands to 
honor You
Because Your word is true, I will sing

Lord it's hard for me to see all the 
thoughts
And plans You have for me, yes it is
But I will put my trust in You
Lord we made Your die to set me free
Oh thank God You did
But I don't know what to say
And I don't know where to start
But as you give the grace
With all that's in my heart"

Lies the city foursquare;
It shall never pass away,
And there is no night there.

CHORUS
God shall wipe away all tears,
There's no death, no pain, nor fears,
And they count not time by years,
For there is no night there.

All the gates of pearl are made,
In the city foursquare;
All the streets with gold are laid,
And there is no night there.

All the gates shall never close
To the city foursquare;
There life's crystal river flows,
And there is no night there.

There they need no sunshine bright,
In that city foursquare;
For the Lamb is all the light,
And there is no night there."

Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I'll worship Your Holy name

The sun comes up
It's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass
And whatever lies before me
Let me be singing
When the evening comes

You're rich in love
And You're slow to anger
Your name is great
And Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons
For my heart to find

And on that day
When my strength is failing
The end draws near
And my time has come
Still my soul will
Sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years
And then forevermore
Forevermore"

Niuone utukufu wako 
Tenda miujiza, tenda maajabu 
Kwani fadhili zako ni bora kuliko uhai ."

And I will spend eternity
Where the soul of man never dies"

Jesus is passing this way,
This way, today;
Jesus is passing this way,
Is passing this way today.

Is there a heart that has wandered?
Come with thy burden today;
Mercy is tenderly pleading,
Jesus is passing this way.

Is there a heart that is broken?
Weary and sighing for rest?
Come to the arms of the Savior,
Pillow thy head on His breast.

Come to thy only Redeemer,
Come to His infinite love;
Come to the gate that is leading
Homeward to mansions above."
1772;SINCE JESUS PASSED BY;;"Like a blind man I wandered
So lost and undone
A beggar so helpless
Without God or His Son

Heard and answered my cry
And oh what a diff'rence

Chorus
Since Jesus passed by
Since Jesus passed by
Since Jesus passed by
Oh what a diff'rence
Since Jesus passed by
Well I can't explain it
And I cannot tell you why
But oh what a diff'rence
Since Jesus passed by) 

All my yesterdays are buried
In the deepest of the sea
That old load of guilt I carried
It's all gone, praise God I'm free
Looking for that bright tomorrow
Where no tears will dim the eye
And oh what a diff'rence
Since Jesus passed by"

CHORUS
Look to Him, keep your eyes upon 
the Savior.
Trust in Jesus, the one who really cares.
Put your hand in the hand of the man 
who never fails.
When you need a friend, look to Him.

Now with a childlike faith, you can 
move your mountain.
With a simple prayer, your answer can

else to turn to.
Don't give up, for He will never 
let you down."

Since Jesus came into my heart;
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea
billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I have ceased from my wand'ring 
and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins which were many 
are all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I'm possessed of a hope that is 
steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And no dark clouds of doubt now my 
pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

There's a light in the valley of death 
now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And the gates of the City 
beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I shall go there to dwell in 
that City I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I'm happy, so happy as 
onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart."
1775;TO THE MASTER;;"When life lets you down, and you feel more 
broken than whole
When the wounds go deeper than words and 
you can't tell a soul
I may not know what you're going through
May not can make that high mountain move
But one thing I've found that I really want 
you to know

CHORUS
If it matters to you, it matters to the master
He wants to share the burdens you bear
Whisper peace when your world gets shattered
If it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain
Or you're really needing an answer
If it matters to you, it matters to the master

Friend, do you think the maker and 
giver of life
Is far too busy to care 'bout your 
trouble and strife?
He sees the sparrow that falls to the ground
And he hears the tears that don't make a sound
If you only knew how precious you 
are in his sight

If it matters to you, it matters to the master
He wants to share the burdens you bear
Whisper peace when your world gets 
shattered
If it's your greatest joy or your deepest pain
Or you're really needing an answer
If it matters to you, it matters to the master"

Of a cross on a hill far away
And now I've a friend up in glory
And He's only a prayer away

Chorus
O He never would say
 'I'm too busy today'
Every tear, every care,
 He's promised He will share
And although He's the Lord of all glory
Yet He's only a prayer away

Sometimes I do fail in my  praying
But He speaks words of love just the same
And deep in my soul there starts flowing
Living waters, songs of praise to His name

If I keep the cross e'er before me
As I die I will live day by day
If I sin, If I fall, He'll restore me
For He's only a prayer away"
1777;SAFE IN THE ARMS;;"Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast;
There by His love o'ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.
Hark! 'tis the voice of angels
Borne in a song to me,
Over the fields of glory,
Over the jasper sea.

Chorus
Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast;
There by His love o'ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.

Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe from corroding care,
Safe from the world's temptations;
Sin cannot harm me there.
Free from the blight of sorrow,
Free from my doubts and fears;
Only a few more trials,
Only a few more tears!

Jesus, my heart's dear Refuge,
Jesus has died for me;
Firm on the Rock of Ages
Ever my trust shall be.
Here let me wait with patience,
Wait till the night is o'er;
Wait till I see the morning
Break on the golden shore."
1778;I'M ANCHORED TO THE SOLID ROCK;;"With all the trouble around me, how

I have no fear of what may be, y Fathers promise
is holding me
I have an anchor that is steadfast and sure

Chorus
I have an anchor in my life, holding to the solid rock
a strong assurance that He gave me and I can not 
Let the storms upon the wather of this life dash about,
I'm anchored to the solid rock.

And will my soul be satisfied when in His 
likeness I'll abide
and with my loved ones I'll feel so at home
They too were tested and they were tried but on 
His promise they rely
we have an anchor that is steadfast and sure."

Let me be as gold and precious

Is to be... holy;
Set apart for You, Lord.
I choose to be... holy;
Set apart for You, my Master,
Ready to do Your will.

Purify my heart,
Cleanse me from within
And make me holy.
Purify my heart,
Cleanse me from my sin, 
deep within."
1780;IT SATISFIES ME;;"In the garden of Gethsemane, 
I can see our Savior there
As He talked to His Father in earnest 
prayer
He said ""If it be thy will, let this 
cup pass from me
But if not Lord, then it satisfies me

Chorus
If it satisfies you Lord, then it satisfies me
These few words may my prayer ever be
If you'd have me on a mountain or in a 
valley on my knees
Either way Lord, it satisfies me

Now the signs of the times, they're on 
every hand
How my heart longs to see the promised 
land
If I go by the grave or in the rapture 
your face I see
Either way Lord, it satisfies me."
1781;I BELIEVE JESUS SAVES;;"In this age of confusion
There's dissolution every where
It's hard to find true peace of mind
Or someone who really cares
I have put my trust in Jesus
He's like no other man I know
His word is true
He will see me through
I believe Jesus

CHORUS
I believe, Jesus saves
I believe a crown of life awaits beyond
the grave
I believe the path the saints have trod
That a prayer can touch the heart of God
I believe the old time ways
I believe Jesus

Though this world has refused Him
Though we abuse Him, He still lives
His grief and pain were for our gain
So that our Lord might freely give
Faith to overcome each trial
The grace to live in victory
His nail scared hands wrote salvation's 
plan
I believe Jesus"

That the time of Christ was near
Though the people couldn't see
What messiah ought to be
Though Your word contained the plan
They just could not understand
Your most awesome work was done
Through the frailty of Your son

Above the clapping of the hands
Above the joy of the saints
Take ye the wings and soar above
The rabble of these things"
1784;I FEEL THE PULL;;"At night I laid in bed, and I begin to cry

Cause I feel the pull.

CHORUS
I feel the pull
I hear the call
And I know His Spirit's moving me
To give my all

And I agree
Lord please come and take control

I went to hear the Word
And with each line and phrase
Oh, He was drawing me to give a 
higher praise
There is a deep, calling to the deep
Like a great magnet pulling me
I know for sure That I reach the goal
Cause I feel the pull"
1785;LONGING FOR HOME;;"I'm only a pilgrim and stranger,
In this unfriendly world that I roam.
For Jesus Who has brought me from darkness,
Has promised me a heavenly home.
In the Bible we read of a city
Whose builder and ruler is God
And someday when this life is over,
Its beautiful sites we'll behold.

Chorus
I'm longing for home, the sun goeth down.
I want to go where, sweet rest can be found.
I'm just about through, with this old house of clay.
I'm leaving this world, for Glory some day.


When the last weary mile has been traveled,
And the gates of that city swing wide.
Oh what a glad feeling 'twill be,
To know that heaven is mine.
Beyond the dark veil of sorrows,
With Jesus forever I'll be.
Oh to that city I'm going,
Behold the Saviour to see."
