Who am I that He would pray not my will, Thy Lord
The answer I may never know
Why He ever loved me so
That to an old rugged cross He'd go
For who am I?

When I'm reminded of His words

If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever

To deserve God's only son
To fight my battles until they're won
For who am I?"

227;Sin Can Never Enter There;D / G;"Heaven is a holy place,
Filled with glory and with grace
Sin can never enter there;
All within its gates are pure,
From defilement kept secure
Sin can never enter there.

Chorus
Sin can never enter there,
Sin can never enter there;
So if at the judgment bar
Sinful spots your soul shall mar,
You can never enter there.

If you hope to dwell at last,
When your life on earth is past,
In that home so bright and fair,
You must here be cleansed from sin,
Have the life of Christ within
Sin can never enter there.

You may live in sin below,
Heaven’s grace refuse to know,
But you cannot enter there;
It will stop you at the door,
Bar you out forevermore
Sin can never enter there.

If you cling to sin till death,
When you draw your latest breath,
You will sink in dark despair
To the regions of the lost,
Thus to prove at awful cost,
Sin can never enter there."

The song I cannot sing.

There is gladness in my soul today,
And hope, and praise, and love,
For blessings which He gives me now,
For joys laid up above."

Waiting for our entrance there
Some sweet day we're going over
All the beauties there to share.

Chorus
Just a Little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait
Just a little while to labor
In the path that’s always straight
Just a little more of trouble
In this low and sinful state
Then we’ll enter Heaven’s portals,
Sweeping thru the pearly gates.

Soon we’ll see the light of morning
Then the new day will begin
Soon we’ll hear the Father calling,
Come my children, enter in.""
Then we’ll hear a choir of angels
Singing out the vict’ry song,
All our troubles will be ended
And we’ll live with heaven’s throng

Soon we’ll meet again our loved ones
And we’ll take them by the hand,
Soon we’ll press them to our bosom
Over in the promised land;
Then we’ll be at home forever,
Thru-out all eternity,
What a blessed, blessed morning
That eternal morn shall be."
263;It's Different Now;Eb / G;"Once I was lost in sin,
I had no peace within
To save my weary soul I knew not how
But Jesus came to me 
And by His grace I'm free
Now it's different, oh, so different now

Chorus
It's different now 
Since Jesus saved my soul
It's diff'rent now 
Since Jesus made me whole
Ole Satan had to flee 
When Jesus rescued me
Now it's different, oh, so different now

I went to church one day
To hear them sing and pray,
The preacher firmly plowed
The gospel plow;
He said you must repent,
So down the aisle he went,
Now it's diff'rent, O so diff'rent now.

Sin's fetters held me fast,
The dye was almost cast,
My proud and haughty spirit
would not bow,
But just one glimpse of Him,
It broke the pow'r of sin,
Now it's diff'rent O so diff'rent now.

Now my hopes are bright,
I praise Him day and night
How he could save me so 
I know not how
But praise the Lord it's done, 
The victory now is won
Now it's different, oh, so different now"
265;I Love To Walk With Jesus;G;"Oh, I love to walk with Jesus

Take away our ev’ry burden,
Giving perfect peace and rest.

Chorus
I will follow where He leadeth,
I will pasture where He feedeth,
I will follow all the way, Lord,
I will follow Jesus ev’ry day.

Oh, I love to walk with Jesus
Like the man of long ago,
Who had tarried by the wayside
Near the gates of Jericho;
Jesus heard his cry for mercy,
Gave him back his sight that day,
And immediately he followed
Jesus all along the way.

Oh, I love to walk with Jesus
All the way to Calv’ry’s brow,
Gaze upon that scene of suff'ring,
While my tears of sorrow flow;
There He tells me how He loves me,
Takes my ev’ry sin away,
So I follow Him so gladly,
Lead me anywhere He may.

Oh, sometime I’ll walk with Jesus
In the land of endless day,
When our journey here is over
And we’ve reached our home to stay;
Then I’ll walk with Him forever
Sing His praises o’er and o’er,
Laugh and shout, and ever tell Him
That I love Him more and more."

274;Blessed Redeemer;G;"Up Calvary's mountain one dreadful morn
Walked Christ my Saviour, weary and worn
Facing for sinners, death on the cross
That He might save them from endless loss

Chorus
Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer
Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree
Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading
Blind and unheeding, dying for me

Father, forgive them, my Saviour prayed
Even while His lifeblood flowed fast away
Praying for sinners while in such woe
No one but Jesus ever loved so

Oh, how I love Him, Saviour and Friend
How can my praises ever find end?
Through years unnumbered on heaven's shore
My songs shall praise Him forever more"
275;It's For Me;;"It's For Me, It's for you

You can read it for yourself
You don't have to ask anybody else,
About the Holy Ghost,
That Jesua is giving away."
276;Jesus Passed By;F / G / A;"There is a story of long ago.
Men roamed in darkness, nowhere to go.
One day the scene changed,
They ceased to cry -
There was a reason Jesus passed by.

Chorus
Glory and honor be to the King.
Shout Hallelujah, make praises ring.
Look to the future home in the sky.
There is a reason Jesus passed by.

Men found compassion, hungry were fed,
Some saw their loved ones raised from the dead.
They found great comfort came from on high -
There was a reason Jesus passed by.

One day a sinner, I found relief.
Gone was my burden, gone was my grief.
Angels were singing and so was I -
There was a reason Jesus passed by."

279;Does Jesus Care;;"Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
Too deeply for mirth and song?
When the burdens press
And the cares distress
And the way grows weary and long?

Chorus
Oh, yes, He cares, I know He cares
His heart is touched with my grief
When the days are weary
The long night dreary
I know my Savior cares

Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
And as the daylight fades
Into deep dark shades
Does He care enough to be near?


Does Jesus care
When I've tried and failed
To resist some temptation strong?
When for my deep grief there's no relief
Though the tears flow all the day long

Does Jesus care when I've said, ""Goodbye""
To the dearest on earth to me
And my sad heart aches
Till it nearly breaks
Is it aught to Him? Does He care?"
281;I've Got My Feet Planted Deep;D / Eb;"I got my feet planted deep 
 in the good, good Word,
Standing on the promises that I've heard.

The Word came to life, He came to me.

I'm a covenant woman.
Living in the riches of my Lord and King.
I'm a covenant woman.
Committed to Him in everything.
I do believe He'll come again.
And I know one thing I'm gonna do 'til then,
Is learn to live in the blessings of Abraham.

The Lord told me what He wants me to be,
To abide in Him and His Words in me.
And anything I'll ask Him, He will do.

Your blood brothers with the Son of the great I AM.
And everything God has He gives to you."

Nobody wanted Him no one shared
In the promise He brought as a baby
that night nobody nobody cared

Chorus
But oh, how the thousands came
When the bread was multiplied
And oh, how the hosannas rang
At the King's triumphant ride
And as long as the miracles flowed like wine
They called him Wonderful
They came to dine.

Nobody wanted Him; no one remained
They only taunted Him when His cross 
 was stained
With the blood freely given for a world 
unchained Nobody nobody nobody cared

Nobody lauded Him; nobody sang
No crowds applauded Him no bells rang
When He went to the desert to fast 
and pray Nobody nobody nobody cared"

289;Springs Of Living Water;D / Eb / F;"I thirsted in the barren land of sin and shame,
And nothing satisfying there I found;
But to the blessed cross of Christ one day I came,
Where springs of living water did abound.

Chorus
Drinking at the springs of living water,
Happy now am I, my soul they satisfy;
Drinking at the springs of living water,
O wonderful and bountiful supply.

How sweet the living water from the hills of God,
It makes me glad and happy all the way;
Now glory, grace and blessing mark the path I've trod,

294;To Much To Gain To Lose;D / Eb;"Too many miles behind me,
Too many trials are through;
Too many tears help me to remember,
There's just too much to gain to lose.

Chorus
Too many sunsets 
 lie behind the mountains,
Too many rivers
 my feet have walked through;
Too many treasures
 awaiting over yonder,
There's too much to gain to lose.

I've crossed the hot, burning desert,
Struggling, the right road to choose;
Somewhere up ahead there's cool, clear water,
And defeat is one word I just don't use.

We shall behold Him, we shall behold Him,
Face to face, in all of His glory;
We shall behold Him, we shall behold Him,
Face to face, our Savior and Lord."
295;I See Jesus;D / Eb;"Once a man named Steven preached
about the Lord,
Folks were saved and folks were healed
as they heard His Word;
Satan did not like it,
soon he had his crowd
And as he was tried they heard 
Steven cry aloud;

Chorus
Oh... I see Jesus standing at the
Father's right hand,
I see Jesus over in the Promised Land;
Work is over now I'm coming to thee,
I see Jesus, standing waiting for me

As the stones fell on him, 
beating out his life,
Steven knew he'd soon be thru, 
with all toil and strife,
So much like a Master, 
with a heart so true,
He ""Lord forgive
 for they know not what they do.""

Thru the gates of glory
down the streets of gold,
Marched the hero of the Lord,
into heaven's fold
When he met the Saviour,
at the great white throne,
I believed he smiled and said
 ""Steven welcome home"""

More than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue thee from hell;

What hast thou borne for Me?
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for Me?

And I have brought to thee,
Down from My home above,
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and My love;

What hast thou brought to Me?

As a rushing, mighty wind,
It filled their hearts with singing, 
And gave them peace within.

Christ Jesus paid the debt
that I could never pay."

He drank all the bitter 
in Gethsemane.

Though tempest may blow 
And the stormclouds arise,
Obscuring the brightness of life,
I'm never alarmed 
At the overcast skies,
The Master looks on at the strife.

I know that He safely 
will carry me through,
No matter what evils betide,
Why should I then care, 
Though the tempest may blow,

Will lead us away,
Beyond that blest heavenly shore."

There will be a great procession 
over on the streets of gold,
When the redeemed

o'er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed
are gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption's story 
with their voices clear and strong,
when the redeemed

when the redeemed
are gathering in.

of mortal ken,
Some day, God only knows 
Just where and when,
The wheels of mortal life 
Shall all stand still,
And I shall go to dwell 
on Zion's hill.

Some day I'll hear the 
angels singing,
Beyond the shadows 
of the tomb;
And all the bells of 
heaven ringing,
While saints are singing, 
""Home, Sweet Home.""

Some day my labors will 
be ended,
And all my wand'rings 
will be o'er,
And all earth's broken ties 
be mended,
And I shall sigh and weep

And all life's burdens 
will be lifted,
The day of rest shall 
dawn at last."

good to me,
I feel like traveling on;
Until that blessed home I see,
I feel like traveling on."

God sends His pure, sweet love,
A sign from above,

Jesus, our Saviour
Came to earth one day;

In a manger of hay;
Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign,
On the wings of a dove.

In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;
Faith wasn't forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign
On the wings of a dove."

Gather with the saints at the river
That flows from the throne of God.

On the bosom of the river,
Where the Saviour-King we own,
We shall meet and sorrow never,
'Neath the glory of the throne.

On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy, golden day.

Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

At the smiling of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour's face,
Saints whom death will never sever
Lift their songs of saving grace.

Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace."

When I reach that city on the hill.

I'm invited to come home to that city,
For the Word says, ""Whosoever will,""
And I'll find there a mansion for me
waiting
When I reach that city on the hill.

Death will never molest me in that city,
Never leave me lying cold and chill;
And I'll enter to live up there forever
When I reach that city on the hill.

So I'll stay here until my Saviour 
calls me,
Trying daily to perform His will;
Then He'll say unto me, ""Well done,""
up yonder
When I reach that city on the hill."

until the day is done;

just because He loves you so.

Oh, if you are sad and lonely,
life is but an empty tomb,
breathe a prayer to Jesus only,
He will drive away the gloom.

When you come to cross the river,
He will be your Friend and guide;
you can live with Him forever,
over on the other side."

Ready my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit Divine!

And while the wave-notes 
Fall on my ear,

Gladly the warm 
Truth everywhere;
Open my heart, 
And let me prepare,
Love with Thy children 
Thus to share."
93;The Love Of God (OB 93);C / Eb;"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

CHORUS
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints and angels song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God's love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race,
The saints and angels' song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."
63;The Old Time Religion (OB 63);G;"It's the old-time Holy Spirit,

But it's good enough for me.

CHORUS
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
It's good enough for me.

It will make you stop your lying;
It will save you when you're dying;
It will start the devil flying;
And It's good enough for me.

It's so good I want no other,
For It makes me love my brother;
And It brings things from under cover,
And It's good enough for me.

It was good for Paul and Silas...

It was good for brother Branham...

It will take us all to heaven..."

Hear the Saviour's earnest call,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Send the Gospel truth to all,

Go with truth the narrow way,

Come, confess Him as your King, 
Jesus, the light of the world;
Then the bells of heaven will ring,
Jesus, the light of the world."
95;It's Dripping With Blood (OB 95);Eb;"The first one to die for 
This Holy Ghost plan,
Was John the Baptist, 
But he died like a man;
Then came the Lord Jesus, 
They crucified Him,
He taught that the Spirit 
Would save men from sin.

CHORUS
It's dripping with blood, Yes, 
It's dripping with blood,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood,
The blood of disciples 
Who died for the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, 
And John the divine,
They gave up their lives so 
This Gospel could shine;
They mingled their blood, 
Like the prophets of old,
So the true Word of God 
Could honest be told.

Then they stoned Stephen, 
He preached against sin,
He made them so angry, 
They dashed his head in;
But he died in the Spirit, 
And gave up the ghost,
And went to join others, 
In that life-giving host.

There's souls under the altar, 
Crying, ""How long?""
For the Lord to punish 
Those who've done wrong;
But there's going to be more 
Who'll give their life's blood
For this Holy Ghost Gospel 
And its crimson flood."
37;Have Thine Own Way (OB 37);Eb;"Have Thine own way, Lord!

While I am waiting, 
Yielded and still.

Search me and try me,
Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in thy presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray!
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o'er my being
Absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me."

342;Zacchaeus (A Wee Little Man);D / F;"Zacchaeus was a wee little man

Cause I'm going to your house today!
Cause I'm going to your house today!'"

   my ship would sail no more.

 

Chorus
And I thank God for The Lighthouse,
I owe my life to Him.
Jesus is The Lighthouse 
 and from the rocks of sin,
He has shown the light around me,
 so that I might clearly see.
If it wasn't for The Lighthouse,
Where would this ship be?

Everyone that lives around us, 
 says tear that old lighthouse down,
The big ships don't sail this way anymore, 
 ain't no use in it standing round.

 when just in time I saw the light
With the light from that old lighthouse, 
 that stands there on the hill."

My Father's own Son, the Saviour of men,
Once wandered o'er earth as the poorest of  them;
But now He is reigning 
forever on high,And will give me a home 
in heav'n by and by.

I once was an outcast, stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted, my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown.

They're building a palace for me over there!
Though exiled from home, yet still I may sing:
All glory to God, I'm a child of the King!"

Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!

I have seen Him in the watchfires
of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on."

Since He rent the veil in two,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Interceding there for you;
For He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due,
For He is the well beloved,

Heights and depths of love so true,
He alone can be the giver,
Since He rent the veil in two."

Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried 
My sins far away;
Rising, He justified 
Freely forever:
One day He's coming - 
Oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him 
Up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him 
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, 
Despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins, 
My Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him 
Alone in the garden,
One day He rested, 
From suffering free;
Angels came down 
O'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, 
My Saviour is He!

One day the grave could 
Conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled 
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death 
He had conquered;
Now is ascended, 
My Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will 
Sound for His coming,
One day the skies with 
His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, 
My beloved ones bringing;

This Jesus is mine!"

A Man of sorrows, 
Tears and agony.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Him!  
How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, 
My all in all!
The great Creator 
Became my Saviour,
And all God's fullness 
Dwelleth in Him.

What condescension, 
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night, 
Not one faint hope in sight;
God, gracious, tender, 
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, 
To save my soul.

Without reluctance, 
Flesh and blood His substance,
He took the form of man, 
Revealed the hidden plan.
Oh glorious mystery, 
Sacrifice of Calvary,
And now I know 
Thou art  the great ""I Am."""

I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns,
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds, nor pois'nous breath,
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
Are feared and felt no more.

And in His bosom rest?"

My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great
Thou art!"

Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there;

And your health you can't regain,
And your soul is 
Almost sinking in despair,
Jesus knows the pain you feel,
He can save and He can heal;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your enemies assail
And your heart begins to fail,
Don't forget that God 
In heaven answers prayer;
He will make a way for you 
And will lead you safely through;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your youthful days are gone
And old age is stealing on,
And your body bends 
Beneath the weight of care;
He will never leave you then,
He'll go with you to the end;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there."

And leads me through 
The Promised Land,

That will be.

Naught of this world's delusive dream:

Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.

CHORUS
Nothing between my soul and the Saviour,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favour,
Keep the way clear!  Let nothing between.

Nothing between like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him ever sever;
He is my all, there's nothing between.

Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self or friends shall not intervene;
Though it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved, there's nothing between.

Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,
Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
I'll triumph at last, with nothing between."

CHORUS
Such love, such wondrous love,
Such love, such wondrous love,
That God should love 
A sinner such as I,
How wonderful is love like this!

That Christ should join 
So freely in the scheme,
Although it meant 
His death on Calvary,
Did ever human tongue 
Find nobler theme
Than love divine 
That ransomed me?

That for a wilful 
Outcast such as I,
The Father planned, 
The Saviour bled and died;
Redemption for 
A worthless slave to buy,
Who long had law 
And grace defied.

And now He takes me 
To His heart, a son,
He asks me not 
To fill a servant's place;
The ""far-off country"" 
Wand'rings all are done,
Wide open are 
His arms of grace."

I'm waiting for the chariot
To swing low and I'll step in,
On the clouds I'll ride to Heaven
When the Saints go marching in.

CHORUS
Oh, my loving brother,
When the world's on fire,
Don't you want God's bosom
To be your pillow,
Hide me over in the rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me.

At the sounding of the trumpet,
At the dawning of the day,
Worldly pleasures with their treasures,
Shall forever pass away.

Poor lost sinners will be crying,
For the home they'll never see,
But the ransomed will be singing
Rock of ages, cleft for me."

I can almost see the lights of that city,
I see them gathering, all around
The great white throne;
With faith in my Saviour,
And His wonderful love,
Oh, I can almost see the lights of home.

And sometimes when I'm burdened,
And my cross seems hard to bear.
And old Satan, he tries to dim my view,
Well I just look unto Jesus,

367;I'm Looking For A City;F / G;"I'm looking for a city,
The one not made by hands,
I'm looking over Jordan,
I see the promised land,
The waters will be parted
And I'll be on my way,
As we're crossing over Jordan 
I can say:

CHORUS
Now I have that everlasting joy within,
Since He came and took away my sin,
The moment that He blessed me,
He made me fully whole,
With that everlasting joy 
Within my soul.

I'm drinking from the fountain
That floweth from on high,
A well of blessed waters
That never shall run dry,
I'm feasting on God's manna,
I'm praying day by day,
And that everlasting joy 
Is here to stay.

I've heard the prophet's message, 
I've placed it in my heart,
I've got the revelation 
That never shall depart,
The Rapture is upon us,
The stage is set to go.
We have this precious promise 
We all know."
368;All That Thrills My Soul;Bb;"Who can cheer the heart like Jesus, 
By His presence all divine?

He is more than life to me; 
And the fairest of ten thousand, 
In my blessed Lord I see.

Love of Christ so freely given, 
Grace of God beyond degree, 
Mercy higher than the heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea.

What a wonderful redemption!
Never can a mortal know
How my sin, tho' red like crimson, 
Can be whiter than the snow.

Every need His hand supplying,
Every good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying,
He is all in all to me.

By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King."

Christians are the only people
In my Father's house
Where there's joy, real joy."

celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away, oh glory, 
I'll fly away;
I won't die 
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows 
Of this life have grown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird from prison 
bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more 
Weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys 
shall never end,
I'll fly away."

Gives me gladness day by day,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

CHORUS
Oh the precious love of Jesus,
How it thrills my ransomed soul!
More and more I'll sing its praises
While the happy ages roll.

When the tempter tries to win me
Something keeps me true and strong;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something makes my life a blessing
To the needy in the throng,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

When misfortune overtakes me
Something calms my troubled breast;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something draws my soul to heaven,
That sweet land of peace and rest.
It is love, my Saviour's love.

Soul astray and bowed in sorrow,
Something waits for you today;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
It would give you peace and comfort,
Make your burdens roll away,
It is love, my Saviour's love."
372;My Sins Are Gone;D / Eb;"You ask me why I'm happy
So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;
And when I meet the scoffers
Who ask me where they are,
I say, my sins are gone.

CHORUS
They're underneath the Blood,
On the Cross of Calvary,
As far removed as darkness 
     is from dawn;
In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
That's good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me 
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

I'm living now for Jesus,
I'm happy night and day,
Because my sins are gone;
My soul is filled with music,
With all my heart I say,
I know my sins are gone."
388;He Set Me Free;G;"Once like a bird 
In prison I dwelt.
No freedom from 
My sorrow I felt.
Then Jesus came 
And listened to me,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

CHORUS
He set me free, 
Yes, He set me free.
He broke the bonds 
Of prison for me.
I'm glory bound 
My Jesus to see,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

Now I am climbing 
Higher each day,
Darkness of night 
Has drifted away.
My feet are planted 
On higher ground,
Glory to God, 
I'm homeward bound.

Good-bye to sin 
And things that confound,
Naught of this world 
Shall turn me around,
Daily I'm working, 
I'm praying too,
Glory to God, 
I'm going through."
373;The Great Emancipator;Ab;"Once my heart and soul 
   were fettered
By the binding chains of sin.
But the Great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Blessed be His holy name!

That's the song of the Redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting
Oh so helpless and alone, 
But the seeking Shepherd found me,
Led me to my Father's home."

To His Bride in this last age.

And what we are raised up for,
Praise the Lord, for the Original Life.

CHORUS
The Original Life, the Original Seed
The Original Word is what I believe.
The Son of Man is revealed
The seventh seal is unveiled
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say.
And our names are seen within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin.
Yes, we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who's the Original Life.

Our eyes of understanding
He has opened up at last.
And sweet victory is ours
Who were chained down in the past.
True Jubilee has sounded
And we have responded
To our God, Who's the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power.
Sleeping saints will wake and join us
For translation in this hour.
Gentiles' days soon will be over
Glory, hallelujah!
To our God, Who's the Original Life."
365;All In All;F;"Of Jesus love I'm singing

A light when shadows fall.

Another Friend so faithful
My soul will never find;

To help me he is near;

Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace."

Converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure,
Making wise the simple.

Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
and the honeycomb.

The statutes of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure,
Enlightening the eyes.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
and the honeycomb.

The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.
And in the keeping of them
There is great reward,
There is great reward.
In the keeping of them
There is great reward."
384;The Church's One Foundation;C;"The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord:
She is His new creation
By water and the Word.
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth,
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping
Their cry goes up, ""How long?""
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song.

Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore.
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the church at rest."

Until all my life is hidden 
Deep within the cleansing flow.

CHORUS
Deeper in that holy life
'Til I'm lost with Christ in God.
Hidden with my blessed Lord
While I walk this earthly sod.

Humbly must I walk with Jesus
In the paths that He doth lead.
Never falter, never murmur
Always to His voice give heed.

Daily must I seek to please Him
Whether it bring joy or pain.
I shall know then just how blessed
Is the worth of Heav'nly gain.

In His likeness I shall come.
Where the saints of all the ages
Shall receive their welcome home."

We're partakers of His holiness
We are citizens of heaven above.

We're partakers of His suffering;
We're partakers of His grace.
We shall meet Him to be like Him
We shall see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming
We are looking to the skies;
We are watching, we are waiting,
We shall dwell with Him, we shall rise.

We shall reign with Him forever;
Men and angels shout and sing.
For dominion has been given
To the family of the King."

He is the great ""I Am""
The Alpha and Omega,

That floods my soul!
Something happened, 
And now I know,
He touched me, 
And made me whole.

Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed 
And made me whole,
I shall never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls."
381;This World Is Not My Home;F;"This world is not my home
I'm just a'passing through
My treasures are laid up 
Somewhere beyond the blue.
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

CHORUS
Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

They're all expecting me
And that's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus
Many years ago.
I know He'll see me through
Tho' I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Just up in the glory land,
We'll live eternally;
The saints on every hand
Are shouting ""victory"".

Drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home

Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony,
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou 
  wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept:
Angels in robes of light arrayed,
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me, like Mary, through 
  the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee:
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear,
Daily my cross for Thee:
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Fill me, Oh Lord, with Thy desire,
For all who know not Thee:
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
To speak of Calvary."
375;I Don't Know What I'd Do;Eb / F;"I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord;
When I look around and see,
All that He has done for me,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord.

Without Him I can do nothing,
Without Him I'd surely fail;
Without Him I'd be drifting,
Like a ship without a sail.

So I'll ask Him to be my pilot,
His Word my compass and guide;
Til I've anchored safely in glory,
For without Him I'd drift with the tide.
Jesus, my Jesus,
Do you know him today?
Please don't turn Him away, Oh,
Jesus, my jesus,
Without Him how lost I would be.

unreservedly

I'm casting my reasoning down,
Listening for that certain sound,
That still small voice deep in my soul;
To lead me where I should go,
Perfect will to daily know
That unto You my works be fulfilled.

Amidst this word of darkness,

Keep pouring Your latter rain,
Faith to use Your power again
That I may return to You 
from whence I came.

Many times my heart is burdened down with care,
but if I'll stand true, that someday

Someday when I get home, where
I never more shall roam,
with my Saviour and my

When I lay this old cross down and 
receive a shining crown
I'm so glad that nothing here, hindered me.

                       Bridge
You'll be glad that nothin' here did hinder you
  When you hear Him say.
""My child, you made it through"";
When you lay this old cross down and 
   recieve a shining crown.
You'll be glad that nothin' here did hinder you."
240;It's Jesus Christ Revealed In Us;D / Eb;"It's Jesus Christ revealed in us,
Jesus Christ revealed in us,
If you want to know the truth in love,
It's Jesus Christ revealed in us."
241;Lord, I Believe;D / Eb;"When sorrow and storms are besetting my track,
And Satan is whisp’ring,""You’d better turn back"",
How oft I have proved it, tho’ dark be the way,
A little believing drives clouds all away.

Chorus
Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe!
Savior, raise my faith in Thee,
Till it can move a mountain;
Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe!
All my doubts are buried in the fountain.

How easy when sailing the sea in a calm,
To trust in the strength of Jehovah’s great arm;
But somehow I find when the waves swamp the boat,
It takes some believing to keep things afloat.

I’ll stand to the end, I have heard people say,
I’ll fight till I die, and will ne’er run away;
But when by temptation so fiercely assailed,
They left off believing, and terribly failed. 

And others there are full of courage and zeal,
Who go to the battle like warriors of steel;
But right in the heat of the conflict with sin,
Instead of believing they faint and give in. 

Then let us remember in running this race,
That faith is not feeling, and trust is not trace;
And when around us seems dark as the night,
We’ll keep on believing, and win in the fight."
243;How Beautyiful Heaven Must Be;D / Eb;"We read of a place that's called heaven
It's made for the pure and the free
These truths in God's Word He hath given
How beautiful heaven must be

Chorus
How beautiful heaven must be
Sweet home of the happy and free
Fair haven of rest for the weary
How beautiful heaven must be

In heaven no drooping nor pining
No wishing for elsewhere to be
God's light is forever there shining
How beautiful heaven must be

Pure waters of life there are flowing
And all who will drink may be free
Rare jewels of splendor are glowing
How beautiful heaven must be

The angels so sweetly are singing
Up there by the beautiful sea
Sweet chords from their gold harps are ringing
How beautiful heaven must be."
246;Do You Know My Jesus?;D / G;"Have you a heart that's weary,
Tending a load of care;
Are you a soul that's seeking
Rest from the burden you bear?

Chorus:
Do you know my Jesus?
Do you know my friend,
Have you heard He loves you,
And that He will abide till the end?

Where is your heart, O, pilgrim,
What does your light reveal;
Who hears your call for comfort
When naught but sorrow you feel?

Who knows your disappointments,
Who hears each time you cry;
Who understands your heartaches,
Who dries the tears from your eyes?"
248;I Love Jesus Best Of All;D / Eb;"I love to sing and pray, rejoicing every day,
I love the blessings when the showers on us fall,
I love the fellowship within the narrow way
But I love Jesus best of all.

Chorus
For He saves my soul from sin (from all my sin)
Gives me peace and joy within (and makes me clean)
I've been buried in His name and of Him I'm not ashamed,
For I love Jesus best of all.

I love to testify of all He's done for me,
I love to see the lost uplifted from the fall,
I love to see them turn from all iniquity,
But I love Jesus best of all.

I love to see the signs that follow saints of God,
I love to hear the joy bells ringing in my soul,
I love to know He leads me by His staff and rod,
But I love Jesus best of all."
249;I Am Determined To Hold Out;C / G;"When I first found Jesus something o’er me stole,
Like lightning it went thru me, and glory filled my soul;
Salvation made me happy, and took my fears away,
And when I meet old Satan to him I always say:

Chorus:
""I am determined to hold out to the end,
Jesus is with me, on Him I can depend,
And I know I have salvation, for I feel it in my soul,
I am determined to hold out to the end.""

Satan was so angry, said he’d soon be back,
Just let the path get narrow, and he will lose the track;
But I’m so full of glory, my Lord I always find,
And I just say to Satan, ""Old man, get thee behind."" [Chorus]

This old-time religion makes me sometimes shout,
I don’t have time to gossip nor any time to pout;
They say that I’m too noisy, but when these blessings flow,
I shout, O hallelujah, I want the world to know. 

When I hear the trumpet sounding in the sky,
And see the mountains trembling, to heaven I will fly;
For Jesus will be calling, there’ll be no time to mend,
With joy I’ll go up singing, ""I’ve held out to the end."""
251;All In Him;D / Eb / F;"The mighty God is Jesus,
The Prince of peace is He,
The everlasting Father,
The King eternally,
The wonderful in wisdom
By whom all things were made;

In Jesus is display’d.

Chorus:
It’s all in Him, it’s all in Him,
The fulness of the Godhead is all in Him;
It’s all in Him, it’s all in Him,
The mighty God is Jesus, and it’s all in Him.

Emmanuel, God with us,
Jehovah, Lord of hosts!
The coming present Spirit,
Who fills the universe,
The Advocate, the High Priest,
The Lamb for sinners slain,
The Author of redemption;
O glory to His name! 

The Alpha and Omega,
Beginning and the end,
The Living Word incarnate,
The helpless sinner’s Friend,
Our wisdom and perfection,
Our righteousness and pow’r,
Yes, all we need in Jesus
We find this very our. 

Our God from whom we’ve waited
Will be the glad refrain
If Israel recreated,
When Jesus comes gain;
Lo! He will come and save us,
Our King and Priest to be,
For in Him dwells all fulness,
And Lord of all is He."
252;Bind Us Together;Eb / F;"Bind us together, Lord
Bind us together
With cords that cannot be broken
Bind us together, Lord
Bind us together
Bind us together in Love

There is only one God,
There is only one King
There is only one Body,
That is why we sing."
255;It's Bubbling;;"Since I Came To Jesus,
For Heaven Made A Start,
My Cup Is Running Over,
There’s Music In My Heart,

Chorus
It’s Bubbling, It’s Bubbling,
It’s Bubbling In My Soul.
There’s Singing And Laughing,
Since Jesus Made Me Whole.
Some Folks Don’t Understand It,
But I Can’t Keep It Quiet.
For it's bubbling, bubbling, bubbling,
Bubbling, bubbling, day and night

I Knew Some Folks Who Had It,
I Saw Their Faces Shine,
But Little Did I Ever,
Think That The Bubbling Would Be Mine,

My Heart Became So Hungry,
My Soul Began To Cry,
Oh God I Want That Blessing,
Or Else I’ll Surely Die,
There’s Bubbling, Bubbling, Bubbling,
Bubbling In My Soul.

When I Died Out To denominations,
And Let Everything Go.
A Landslide Came From Heaven,
With a bubbling, bubbling, bubbling"
256;I Have Found The Way;Eb / F;"I have found the way
That leads to endless day,
Yonder in the glory-land;
And the road is bright,
For Jesus is the light,
And I hold His guiding hand.

Chorus
I have found the way,
I have found the way,
Glory hallelujah,
I have found the way.

I will never fear,
While Jesus is so near,
I will bravely meet the foe;
Happy songs I’ll sing,
In honor to the King,
And to glory onward go.

To the journey’s end,
Led by a faithful Friend,
Nevermore in sin to roam;
By the way called straight,
I’ll reach the golden gate
Of the soul’s eternal home."

  down here and planning ahead
So busy with their fortunes 
  they forgot what Jesus said
About the wars and earthquakes 
  and the fig tree's budding leaves
But there's a group of people 
  getting ready to leave.

Chorus
Ready to leave in a 
  twinkling of an eye,
Making investments in 
  the Bank up in the Sky
I've made preparations 
  not a reason to grieve,
Are you in that number 
  getting ready to leave?

Sinner what's the reason

While you're hesitating 
  Christ could come just any day
Heed the Spirit's calling 
  make your way to Calvary
And get in the number 
  getting ready to leave"

Living in a lonely land
With strangers we're a band 
Of pilgrims on the move
Thru dangers 
Burdened down with sorrows

But we are looking 
For a city built above

Chorus
Looking for a city, 
Where we'll never die
There the sainted millions 
Will never say goodbye
There we'll meet our Savior 
And our loved ones too
Come o Holy Spirit, 
All our hopes renew

Here in disappointment 
Often we so sadly roam
And earthly friends no longer 
Speak one word of love
But truly we have found contentment 
Jesus promised us a home
So we are looking 
For a city built above

In this land of dangers 
We are going here and there
We're simply trusting 
In the blessed savior's love
And mercy tho' we may be strangers 
Living in this world of care
We're always 
looking for a city built above"

""It is well, it is well with my soul.""

CHORUS
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well 
With my soul.

Tho' Satan should buffet,
Tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control.
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood
for my soul.

My sin - oh, the bliss 
Of this glorious thought -
My sin - not in part, 
But the whole
Is nailed to the cross;
And I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Oh my soul.

And Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight.
The clouds be rolled back 
as a scroll.
The trump shall resound, 
And the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee,
For Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, 
is our goal;
Oh, the shout of the angel!
Oh, the voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope!
Blessed rest of my soul!"
382;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God;C;"A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe -
His craft and pow'r are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He -
Lord Sabaoth His name,
From age to age the same -
And He must win the battle.

And tho this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph thru us.
The Prince of darkness grim - 
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! His doom is sure -
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow'rs -
No thanks to them - abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Thru Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still -
His kingdom is forever."

Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding sacrifice

Before the throne my surety stands,
My name is written on His hands,
My name is written on His hands.

He ever lives above, 
For me to intercede;
His all redeeming love, 
His precious blood, to plead:
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

Five bleeding wounds He bears;
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers; 
They strongly plead for me:
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Nor let that ransomed sinner die!""
""Nor let that ransomed sinner die!""

The Father hears Him pray,
His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away, 
The presence of His Son;
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.
And tells me I am born of God.

My God is reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear:
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And ""Father, Abba, Father,"" cry.

ought to be,
His blood can cleanse your heart
and make you free:
His love can fill your soul,
And you will see 'twas best for Him
To have His way with Thee.

Would you have Him make you free, 
and follow at His call?
Would you know the peace that
comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you,
so that you need never fall?
Let Him have His way with Thee.

Would you in His kingdom find
a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true
in providential test?
Would you in His service labour
always at your best?
Let Him have His way with Thee."

The ones who trusted in His grace

CHORUS
I'm longing for Jesus to come back
I long for Jesus Christ my King
To come and take me
To my home beyond the skies,
Up there where angels shout and sing.

Sometimes the road 
Seems rough and hard,
The pathway seems so long,
But He is ever by my side.
He whispers loving words to me
And tells me to be strong,
That He will always lead and guide."
392;Thank God I Am Free;G;"For a long time I travelled
Down a long lonely road;
My heart was so heavy in sin I sank low.

What a wonderful hour;
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out
Through His saving power.

CHORUS
Thank God I am free, free, free
From this world of sin.
Been washed in the blood of Jesus,
I've been born again.
Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved
By His wonderful grace.
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out 
And show me the way.

Like a bird out of prison
That's taken its flight;
Like a blind man that God 
Gave back  his sight.
Like a poor wretched beggar
That's found fortune and fame,
I'm so glad that I found out 
He could bring me out
Thro' His Holy name."
397;Land Of Milk And Honey;G;"There is a land of milk and honey
There is a land
Where we won't need money.

Our blessed Saviour.

CHORUS
And that's the reason
We shout ""Hallelujah""
Praising our King across the river.
That shining river
Where the saints will gather
There we shall see 
Our blessed Messiah.

Elijah has come, 
He has done his work already
As John has said, 
The Bride has made ready.
And now we are waiting 
For the coming of Jesus.
For that blessed day
When the Lamb shall take us.

Our hopes are bright, 
Our lamps are burning.
And day by day 
Our hearts are yearning.
This is the evening
He will come in the morning.
Then we shall wait 
Until the dawning."

When I pause to remember,
A heartache here

Along the trail 
That's winding always upward,
This troubled world 
Is not my final home.

CHORUS
But until then, 
My heart will go on singing,
Until then, 
With joy I'll carry on.
Until the day 
Mine eyes behold the city
Until the day 
God calls me home.

The things of earth 
Will dim and lose their value,
If we recall, 
They're borrowed for awhile
And things of earth 
That cause the heart to tremble
Remembered there, 
Will only bring a smile.

This weary world 
With all its toil and struggle,
May take its toll 
Of misery and strife,
The soul of man 
Is like a waiting eagle
When it's released 
It's destined for the sky."

CHORUS
I've been changed, 
I've been reborn,
All my life has been rearranged;
What a difference it makes
When the Lord has His way
All my life praise God, 
Has been changed.

Tho' my sins were as scarlet
They're white as snow,
I was bound but today I am free;
I was lost in the darkness
But now I'm found,
I was blind but now I see.

When at last in His presence
I stand above,
He will wipe every tear 
From my eyes;
And I'll thank Him for giving 
A wretch like me,
A new home beyond the sky."
406;I'm In That Number;Ab;"I'm in that number, I'm in that number,
I'm in that number robed in white;
I'm in that number, I'm in that number,
I'm in that number robed in white.

That blood-washed number,
That blood-washed number,
I'm in that number robed in white;
That blood-washed number,
That blood-washed number,
I'm in that number robed in white.

John saw that number,

415;Let Go Of The Old;Eb;"Let, let go of the old,
And lay, lay hold on the new,
In laying it down a new life is found
There a new life waits for you.

Cast your bread upon the waters
After many days it shall return.
If you pour out your soul
Not a part, but the whole
A new life is there for you.

In saving your life, you will lose it,
But by losing it, you will find it,
Down in the ground 
That's where death is found,
Death that brings life anew."

From the onset of time
For the chains of defeat there's no key.
See the tears of the broken,
The cries of the slaves

And thousands of voices
Are swelling the song,
Worthy the lamb that was slain.

Because He first loved me.
To purchase my redemption
He hung upon a tree.
At last He cried ""Tis finished""
He hung His head and died,
Oh what a sight for sinners,
My Jesus crucified.

They mocked Him 
And they scoffed Him,
With thorns they crowned His head,
As a lamb unto the slaughter
My Saviour! -  He was led.
The soldier's cruel dagger 
Was thrust into His side,
Oh what a sight for sinners,
My Saviour crucified.

I have a risen Savior,
He means so much to me.

His blessed face to see.

And in His Word abide.
And one day I shall se Him,
My Savior crucified."

Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me, 
Drew me back into the way.

I was bruised but Jesus healed me,  
Faint was I from many a fall,
Sight was gone, 
And fears possessed me, 
But He freed me from them all.

He will keep me till the river  
Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He'll bear me safely over, 
Where the loved ones I shall meet.

Soon He'll come the Lord of Glory,  
Come the church His bride to claim,
And complete the wondrous story, 
Come, Lord Jesus, come again."

638;All Things Bright And Beautiful;;"All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful:
The Lord God made them all.

Each little flow'r that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings.

The purple-headed mountains,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning
That brightens up the sky.

The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.

The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
To gather every day.

He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well."

Only a little sling,
Only a boy named David,

Only a boy named David,
Only a rippling brook,

But five little stones he took.
And one little stone went in the sling,
And the sling went round and round,
And one little stone went in the sling,
And the sling went round and round,
And round and round and round
 and round and round and round
 and round.
And one little stone went up in the air,
And the giant came tumbling down."
640;How Did Moses Cross The Red Sea?;;"Moses led a mighty nation
From a long captivity;
God prepared a way before them,
Sent His cloud for all to see;
Fed them manna fron the heaven,
Shod the clothes continually,
Then He faced the deep red sea.

Chorus 1
How did Moses cross the Red Sea?
How did Moses cross the Red Sea?
How did Moses cross the Red Sea?
How did he get across?

Did he swim? No! No! Did he row? No! No!
Did he jump? No! No! No! No! Did he drive? No! No!
Did he fly? No! No! How did he get across?
God blew with His wind Puff, puff, puff, puff
He blew just enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
And through the sea He made a path
That's how he got across.

I was freed from Satan's slav'ry
And Christ gave me victory;
Life's confused and tangled problems 
sometimes made a sea for me.
As hHe made a path for Moses ,
Thro' the stormy, troubled sea,
He will make a way for me.

David went to see his brothers,
In the army of the King,
Heard the challenge of Goliath,
But they did not do a thing;
Little David said ""I'll slay him
And his head to you I'll bring,""
An he marched to fight the giant.

Chorus 2
How did Daivd fight the giant?
How did Daivd fight the giant?
How did Daivd fight the giant?
How did he fight Goliath?

Did he run? No! No! Use a gun? No! No!
With the sword? No! No! No! No!
Did he fear? No! No! Used a spear? No! No!
How did he kill the giant?
He put a little rock in a sling, sling,sling
Then he let it go with a zing, zing, zing;
He hit the giant on the head,
That's how he killed the giant.

As we fight our daily battle
In the army of the King ,
Giants of sin and fear beset us,
and it's hard to even sing;
If we trust and do not doubt Him
He the victory will bring,
For David killed the giant."

But bring forth only the best of the wine 
So I press toward the mark of the prize of 
 high calling.
To be part of that beautiful lady! The Bride."

Shadrach meshach and Abednego;

But God was there, He'd never let them go,
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego."

I had no hope no peace within
Down on my knees in agony
I prayed to Jesus and He gladly set me free

Chorus
I never shall forget the day
And all the burdens of my soul were rolled away
It made me happy, be glad and free
I'll sing and shout it, God means everything to me

Now I can feel, him at my side
My fewer steps, he comes to guide
When trials come, he comforts me
To faith in him or sin I have a victory

Oh, sinner come to Jesus now
At His dear feet just humbly bow
Confess to Him your every sin
He'll save and cleanse you, 
Give you peace and joy within"

He chose me tho unworthy, He chose me;
My willing heart was all He sought,
  though sin had a hold on me;
His love looked deep into 
 my heart and saw mold ability 
Jesus calls to many, but He chose me.

I was on God's mind before the cross and pain;
When God saw me, He saw much more than I
  could ever see.
Jesus calls to many, but He chose me."

Crushed beneath my burden of sorrow and care;

CHORUS:
He lifted me out of the deep miry clay;
He settled my feet in the straight, narrow way;
He lifted me up to a heavenly place,
And floodeth my soul each day with His grace.

I was wandering afar from my Saviour and home,
Fainting and weary in sin did I roam;
I needed a hand to turn me about,
Then Jesus reached down and lifted me out.

I was building my home on the dry shifting sand,
Casting my lot in a cold barren land;
You're doomed now for aye I heard Satan shout;
But Jesus reached down and lifted me out.

I have started for heaven my heart filled with song
Wandering is over my sins all are gone;
Through Jesus' own blood cleansed within and without
O praise His dear name He lifted me out."

I was there when the spirit came

Oh Holy Father just let thy goodness reign
Feed me Lord Jesus with thy spirit once again
If you've never felt His power then
You had better go repent again
I was there when the spirit came

It was on the day at Pentecost
The disciples in the spirit were lost
They were there when the spirit came
Like a mighty rushing roar of wind
The power fell just the same as when
I was there when the spirit came"

As a shield today?

Oh, how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day.
So, when life gets dark and dreary,
Don’t forget to pray.

When you met with great temptation,
Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit,
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As you guide and stay.

When your heart was filled with anger,
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who had crossed your way?

When sore trials came upon you,
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was full of sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates of day?"
678;Trust The Lord;;"While we labour in the vineyard for the Lord,

Turst the Lord; Trust the Lord.
Turst the Lord; Trust the Lord.
If in Him you abide,
His perfect will you'll find;
If only you can trust Him more.

When you need just an answer to your prayer,
When it feels that He doesn't seem to care,
Just trust in Him for His grace;
And He will lead you to a place 
Where you'll know exactly what to do.

When you find yourself in doubt and despair,
When your burdens seem to heavy to bear,
Just trust Him for His grace;
And He will lead you to a place 
Where your burdens shall forever roll away."

Without Him, how lost I would be

Without Him, I would be dying
Without Him, I'd be enslaved
Without Him, life would be horpeless,

Chorus
There's nothing, no nothing, there's nothing
That my God can't do.
MIracles and wonders, and there's nothing,
No nothing, that my God can't do.

Out on the open sea,
By faith alone, sight unknown,
And yet His eyes were watching me.

Chorus
The Anchor holds, though the ship is battered,
The Anchor holds, though the sails are torn.
WellI have fallen on my knees, 
But the Anchor holds, in spite of the storm.

I've had vision and I've had dreams;
Well I've even held them in my hands,
But I never knew those dreams
Could slip right through
Like they were only grains of sand.

Now I have been young,but I am older now.
O and there has been beauty
These eyes have seen;
But it was in the night when I faced 
The storms of life.
Oh, that's where God proved His love to me"

And from this world, I will be set free."
702;Look For Me;;"When you finally make 
Your entrance to that city
Of jasper walls and
Bright golden avenues

Beauty and it's splendour
Remember, there's just
One request I beg of you;

horus
Look for me, I'd like to hear from you.
I realize, when you arrive,
There'll be so much to view.
After you've been there ten thousand years, 
A million, maybe two
Look for me, for I will be there too

As you go down your list of firsts,
There's no question.
You'll want to see your loved ones 
Waiting there for you
And when you feel you've shared
Your story with the last one
Who wants to hear you tell,
Just how you made it through"

Oh, when I come to the end of my journey,
Weary of life and the battle is won;
Carrying the staff and the cross of redemption,
He'll understand and say, ""Well done.""

Misunderstood, the Savior of sinners,
Hung on the cross; He was God's only Son;
Oh! hear Him call His Father in Heav'n,
""Not my will, but Thine be done."" 

If when this life of labor is ended,
And the reward of the race you have run;
Oh! the sweet rest prepared for faithful
Will be His blest and final, ""Well done."" 

But if you try and fail in your trying,
Hands sore and scarred from the work you've begun;
Take up your cross, run quickly to meet Him;
He'll understand; and say, ""Well done."""
8109;Look Away To Jesus;;"For many years He called my name 
Told me all I had to gain 
But each time He gave the call I just looked away; 
Then He turned my eyes around 
He set my feet on higher ground 
From Satan's power that very hour I looked away. 

Chorus
Look away to Jesus, look away 
There's a beauty of Jesus Christ on display 
Just feast your eyes upon the word of life today 
From fear and dread just turn your head and look away. 

In this day we look and learn Sin is everywhere we turn 
But there's a message from above 
Just look away If He asked us to turn our head

The sweetest Name on earth.

Oh, how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me!

It tells me of a Savior's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner’s perfect plea.

It tells me what my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below."

Through the frailty of Your Son

Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land -
A shelter in the time of storm.

No fears alarm, no foes afright,
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shelter in the time of storm;

Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more,
Be saved, to sin no more,
Be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave."

Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, I will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee and cause thee
to stand,
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for  repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;

Chorus
Alone with God, 
the world forbidden.
Alone with God, 
Oh blest retreat!
Alone with God 
and in Him hidden,
To hold with Him 
communion sweet.

What tho' the clouds have 
gathered o'er me?
What tho' I've passed 
beneath the rod?
God's perfect will there 
lies before me,
When I am thus 
alone with God.

'Tis there I find new 
strength for duty,
As o'er the sands 
of time I plod;
I see the King in 
all His beauty.
While resting there 
alone with God.

And when I see the 
moment nearing
When I shall sleep 
beneath the sod,
When time with me 
is disappearing,
I want to be 
alone with God."

A harp, a home, a mansion fair,
A victor's palm, a joy untold,
Are mine when I get there.
For Jesus is my Saviour,
He washed my sins away, 
Paid my debt on Calvary's mountain
I'm happy in His dying love
Singing all the way, 
I'm living yes I'm living in the Fountain.

Marching on thro' the hosts of sin, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Vict'ry's mine, while I've Christ within,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on while the worldlings sneer, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Perfect love casteth out all fear,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on in the Spirit's might,
Marching on, I am marching on;
More than a conqueror in every fight,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on to the realms above,
Marching on, I am marching on;
There to sing of redeeming love,

Let the earth hear His voice;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, 
Through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; 
Great things He hath done.

Oh, perfect redemption, 
The purchase of blood,
To every believer 
The promise of God;
The vilest offender 
Who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus 
A pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing 
Through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, 
And greater will be
Our wonder, our transport 
When Jesus we see."

Blessed Redeemer, 
Pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, 
Come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image 
Deep on my heart.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Full of compassion,
Loving, forgiving, 
Tender and kind,
Helping the helpless, 
Cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wandering 
Sinner to find.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless, 
Patient and brave;
Meekly enduring 
Cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer, 
Others to save.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lord, I am coming,
Now to receive 
Th' anointing divine,
All that I am and have 
I am bringing,
Lord, from this moment 
All shall be Thine.

Oh to be like Thee, 
While I am pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit, 
Fill with Thy love,
Make me a temple 
Meet for Thy dwelling,
Fit me for life 
And heaven above."

You are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged, 
Thinking all is lost,

What the Lord hath done.

CHORUS
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Count your blessings,
See what God hath done;
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Count your many blessings,
See what God hath done.

Are you ever burdened 
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing 
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised 
You His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings, 
Money cannot buy
Your reward in Heaven, 
Nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict, 
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, 
God is over all;
Count your many blessings, 
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you 
To your journey's end."
199;What A Friend;F;"What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,

In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there."

Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing,
When He said, Wilt thou be clean?

CHORUS
I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His blood has washed away 
each stain.

Though the way seems straight 
and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him,
Glory, glory to His name!

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in;
He's forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin."

""I will pour water on him 
who is thirsty, 
I will pour floods upon 
the dry ground;
Open your heart 
For the gift I am bringing,
While ye are seeking Me, 
I will be found.""

Child of the world, 
Are you tired of your bondage?
Weary of earth-joys,
So false, so untrue;
Thirsting for God, 
And his fullness of blessing?
List to the promise -- 
A message for you.

Child of the kingdom, 
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Nothing but fullness 
Thy longing can meet.
'Tis the enduement 
For life and for service;
Thine is the promise, 
So certain, so sweet."

Feasting, I'm feasting,
In this land of Canaan I'll abide,
Feasting with my Lord.

CHORUS
Feasting, I am feasting,
Feasting with my Lord;
Feasting, I am feasting
On the living Word.

Feeding on the honey 
and the wine,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Gathering the clusters 
from the vine,
Feasting with my Lord.

Day by day we have 
a new supply,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
And the food is never 
stale nor dry,
Feasting with my Lord.

Many times we have 
an extra spread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Then to deeper truths 
I have been led,
Feasting with my Lord.

Often there are only 
just us two,
Feasting I'm feasting
Then He tells me what 
He'd have me do,
Feasting with my Lord.

If perchance the cupboard's
scarce of bread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
On the hidden manna 
I am fed,
Feasting with my Lord."

Something I never had;
Jesus has taken my sins away,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

CHORUS
Oh say, but I'm glad, I'm glad,
Oh say, but I'm glad;
Jesus has come 
And my cup's overrun;
Oh say but I'm glad.

Wonderful, marvelous 
Love He brings,
Into a heart that's sad;
Through darkest tunnels 
The soul just sings,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

We have a fellowship 
Rich and sweet,
Tongues can never relate;
Abiding in Him is a real treat,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

Won't you come to Him 
With all your care,
Weary and worn and sad?
You too, will sing 
As His love you share.
Oh say, but I'm glad."

The Comforter has come!
The Holy Ghost from Heav'n, 
The Father's promise giv'n;
O spread the tidings 'round, 
wherever man is found --
The Comforter has come!

The long, long night is past, 
the morning breaks at last,
And hushed the dreadful wail 
and fury of the blast,
As o'er the golden hills 
the day advances fast!
The Comforter has come!

Lo, the great King of kings,
with healing in His wings,
To ev'ry captive soul 
a full deliv'rance brings;
And thro' the vacant cells
the song of triumph rings;
The Comforter has come!

O boundless love divine! 
how shall this tongue of mine 
To wond'ring mortals tell
the matchless grace divine
That I, a child of hell,
should in His image shine!
The Comforter has come!"
688;Trust And Obey;F;"When we walk with the Lord
In the Light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

CHORUS
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey."
5098;The Breaking Of The Day;Eb;"'Tis almost time for the Lord to come, 
I hear the people say;
The stars of heav'n are growing dim:
It must be the breaking of the day.

Chorus
O, it must be the breaking of the day,
O, it must be the breaking of the day;
The night is almost gone,
The day is coming on:
O, it must be the breaking of the day.

The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
In earth and sea and sky,
Aloud proclaim to mortal men,
That the coming of the Master
draweth nigh.

It must be time for the waiting church 
To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps
To look for the breaking of the day.

There must be those in the field of sin,
Far from the fold astray,
Who once were happy in Jesus' love,
And looking for the breaking of the day.

Go quickly out in the streets and lanes,
And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt and blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the day."
795;Faith Of Our Fathers! Living Still;G;"Faith of our fathers! living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
Oh how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word

CHORUS
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children's fate,
If they, like them, could die for Thee!

Faith of our fathers! we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, 
As love knows how,
By kindly words and virtuous life!"

I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, 
And I am His child.

CHORUS
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

Under His wings, 
What a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly 
Turns to His rest!
Often when earth has 
No balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, 
And there I am blest.

Under His wings, 
O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till 
Life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, 
No evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus 
I'm safe evermore."
6001;Lead Me, Savior;C;"Savior lead me, lest I stray,
Gently lead me all the way;
I am safe when by Thy side, 
I would in Thy love abide.

Chorus
Lead me, lead me, Savior, 
lead me, lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me Savior, all the way.

Thou the refuge of my soul,
When life's stormy billows roll,
I am safe when Thou art nigh,
All my hopes on Thee rely.

Savior, lead me, then at last, 
When the storm of life is past,
To the land of endless day, 
Where all tears are wiped away."
207;I See A Crimson Stream;Ab;"On Calvary's hill of sorrow
Where sin's demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid.

CHORUS
I see a crimson stream of blood.
It flows from Calvary,
Its waves which reach 
the throne of God,
Are sweeping over me.

Today no condemnation
Abides to turn away
My soul from His salvation,
He's in my heart to stay.

When gloom and sadness whisper
""You've sinned, no use to pray"",
I look away to Jesus,
And He tells me to say:

And when we reach the portal
Where life forever reigns,
The ransomed hosts grand final
Will be this glad refrain."
6002;Like Zion's Holy Mount;C;"All they who put their trust in God
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount,
By many ages proved.

Chorus
Like the mount of God, 
Like the mount of God;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
By many ages proved.
They can never be removed, removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
They can never be removed.

As round about Jerusalem
The rugged mountains lie,
So round about His holy saints
Our God is ever nigh.

Tho' fierce the storm in fury beat
And awful thunders roar,
The children of the mighty God
Are safe forevermore.

Thus over-shadowed by His love,
Where harm can ne'er betide,
Within this refuge safe and sure
I ever would abide"
597;Joy Unspeakable;Ab;"I have found His grace 
Is all complete,
He supplieth every need;
While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet,
I am free, yes free indeed.

CHORUS
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Oh, the half has never yet been told.

I have found the pleasure 
I once craved,
It is joy and peace within;
What a wondrous blessing! 
I am saved
From the awful guilt of sin.

I have found that hope 
So bright and clear,
Living in the realm of grace;
Oh, the Savior's presence is so near,
I can see His smiling face.

I have found the joy 
No tongue can tell,
How its waves of glory roll!
It is like a great o'erflowing well,
Springing up within my soul."
30;Higher Ground (OB 30);F;"I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as I'm onward bound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

CHORUS
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on Heaven's table land,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell 
Where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till heaven I've found,
Lord, lead me on to higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground."
996;In The Twinkling Of An Eye;Bb;"When the trump of the great archangel
Its mighty tones shall sound,
And, the end of the world proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of man shall come in His glory,
With all the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies 
from the multitudes that rise,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Chorus
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
The trumpet shall sound, the dead 
shall be raised,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

When He comes in the clouds descending,
And they who loved Him here,
From their graves shall awake and praise Him
With joy and not with fear;
When the body and the soul are united,
And clothed no more to die,
What a shouting there will be 
when each other's face we see,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Oh the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in pow'r
And the songs of the blood-bought millions 
Shall hail that blissful hour;
When we gather safely home in the morning,
And night's dark shadows fly,
What a shouting on the shore
when we meet to part no more,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye."
758;Break Thou The Bread Of Life;C;"Break Thou the bread of life,
Dear Lord to me,
As Thou didst break
The loaves beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page,
I seek Thee Lord;
My spirit pants for Thee,
Oh living Word!

Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord
To me, To me,
As Thou didst bless
The bread by Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My All in All.

Teach me to live, dear Lord,
Only for Thee,
As Thy disciples lived in Galilee;
Then, all my struggles o'er,
Then, victory won,
I shall behold Thee, Lord,
The living One."
33;Rock Of Ages (OB 33);G;"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee."
6005;Signs Are Everywhere;Bb;"The King is coming in glory 
To catch His bride away,
It may be in the morning  
It may be at mid-day, 
At the even or midnight;

The dead in Christ, and we that live,
His voice shall hear.

Chorus
The King is coming, hallelujah! 
He's coming in the air,
The fig tree is budding, 
The signs are everywhere,
The saints are looking ever up-ward
While jour'ning on their way, 
He's coming, hallelujah!
To catch his bride away.

Behold! He cometh, and leaping  
And skipping o'er the hills;
Like the young roe, like the young hart, 
My soul with rapture thrills; 
Thru the window He's looking,
Thru the lattice-work is seen, 
The winter's past, the rain is o'er, 
The figs are green.

The King is coming , ""Be ready,""  
To meet Him on that day;
With your heart right, 
     with your robes white,
And in this holy way;  
Like the light'ning that flashes
In the twinkling of an eye, 
Our Lord shall come to claim His own
He's drawing nigh."
940;I Remember Calvary;Eb;"Where He may lead me, I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him so,
And I remember 'twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

CHORUS

Jesus shall lead me all the way,
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

Oh, I delight in His command,
Love to be lead by His dear hand;
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.

Onward I go, no doubt, nor fear,
Happy with Christ my Savior near,
Trusting that I some day shall see,
Jesus, my Friend of Calvary."
16;Cleanse Me (OB 16);F;"Search me, Oh God, 
And know my heart today;
Try me, Oh Savior, 
Know my thoughts, I pray:
See if there be some wicked 
way in me:
Cleanse me from every sin, 
and set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing 
me from sin:
Fulfill Thy Word, and make me 
pure within:
Fill me with fire where once I
burned with shame:
Grant my desire to magnify 
Thy name.

Lord take my life, and make it 
wholly Thine:
Fill my poor heart with 
Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, 
self and pride;
I now surrender: Lord in me abide.

Oh, Holy Ghost, revival comes 
from Thee:
Send a revival, 
Start the work in me:
Thy Word declares, 
Thou wilt supply our need:
For blessing now, Oh Lord, 
I humbly plead."
853;He Rolled The Sea Away;C;"When Israel out of bondage came,
A sea before them lay;
The Lord reach'd down 
His mighty hand,
And rolled the sea away.

Chorus
Then forward still, 
'tis Jehovah's will, 
Tho' the billows dash and spray,
With a conq'ring tread 
we will push ahead
He'll roll the sea away.

Before me was a sea of sin,
So great I feared to pray;
My heart's desire the Savior read,
And rolled the sea away.

When sorrows dark, like stormy waves,
Were dashing o'er my way,
Again the Lord in mercy came, 
And rolled the sea away.

And when I reach the sea of death,
For needed grace I'll pray;
I know the Lord will quickly come,
And roll the sea away."

Oh that will be glory for me,
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace 
I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.

When by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in Heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Friends will be there 
I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Savior, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me."
856;He Was Nailed To The Cross For Me;Eb;"What a wonderful, wonderful Savior,
Who would die on the cross for me!
Freely shedding His precious life blood,
That the sinner might be made free.

CHORUS
He was nailed to the cross for me,
He was nailed to the cross for me;
On the cross crucified, for me He died;
He was nailed to the cross for me.

Thus He left His heavenly glory
To accomplish His Father's plan;
He was born of the Virgin Mary,
Took upon Him the form of man.

He was wounded  for our transgressions,
And He carried our sorrows, too;
He's the Healer of every sickness,
This He came to the world to do.

So He gave His life for others
In redeeming this world from sin,
And He's gone to prepare a mansion,
That at last we may enter in."
44;God Leads Us Along (OB 44);C / Eb;"In shady green pastures, 
so rich and sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water's cool flow 
Bathes the weary one's feet,
God leads His dear children along.

CHORUS
Some through the waters, 
Some through the flood,
Some through the fire, 
But all through the blood;
Some through great sorrow, 
But God gives a song;
In the night season 
And all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount 
Where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley 
In the darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

Tho' sorrows befall us, 
And Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, 
Defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.

Away from the mire, 
And away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity's day.
God leads His dear children along."
52;He Brought Me Out (OB 52);C;"My heart was distressed 
'Neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins 
Dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord 
From the deep, miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out 
to golden day.

CHORUS
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah.

He placed me upon 
The strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established 
and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling 
While here I remain,
But stand by His grace 
Until the crown I gain.

He gave me a song, 
'Twas a new song of praise,
By day and by night 
Its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing, 
I'm happy and free,
I'll praise my Redeemer, 
Who has rescued me.

I'll sing of His wonderful 
mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men 
His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation 
At home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth 
And trust in God.

I'll tell of the pit, 
With its gloom and despair,
I'll praise the dear Father, 
Who answered my prayer;
I'll sing my new song, 
The glad story of love,
Then join in the chorus 
With the saints above."
748;Beneath The Cross Of Jesus;C;"Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the 
noonday heat,
And the burden of the day.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart 
with tears,
Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love
And my own worthlessness.

I take, Oh cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross."
5076;Like A Mighty Sea;F;"My soul today is thirsting 
for living streams divine,
To sweep from highest heaven 
to this poor heart of mine;
I stand upon the promise, 
in Jesus' name I plead;
Oh send the gracious current
to satisfy my need.

Chorus
Like a mighty sea,
like a mighty sea,
Comes the love of Jesus, 
sweeping over me;
The waves of glory roll,
the Savior to extol,
Comes the love of Jesus,
sweeping o'er my soul.

I see the clouds arising,
the mercy clouds of love,
That come to bring refreshing
down from the throne above,
The earnest of the shower,
just now to us is giv'n,
And now we wait, expecting 
the floods of grace from heav'n.

The show'rs of grace are falling,
the tide is rolling in,
The flood-tide of salvation,
with power to cleanse from sin;
It's surging thro' my being 
and takes my sin away,
It keeps me shouting glory!
thro' all the happy day.

It's coming, yes, it's coming,
it's coming down this hour,
A torrent of salvation  
in saving cleansing pow'r.
I hear the billows surging,
I see them mount and roll;
Oh glory, hallelujah!
they're sweeping thro' my soul."
3570;Elijah's God;;"Elijah made a sacrifice
To offer to Jehovah;
It had been wet with water thrice,
Baal's sacrifice was over.
Elijah prayed: the fire came down
And licked the water all around;
So doubting ones believed, and found
Elijah's God was living

Chorus
Elijah's God still lives today,
To take the guilt of sin away;
And when I pray my heart's desire,
Upon my soul He sends the fire.

Elijah's God still lives today;
And answers still by fire
My friend, just let Him have His way;
He'll grnat your heart's desire.
Consume the sacrifice you make
And bid your slumbr'ing soul awake;
The chains of inbred sin will break;
Elijah's God is living.

Elijah's God still lives today
And answers still by power,
As when Elijah prayd for rain,
God answered with a shower.
If you would have your soul refreshed
With rain that falls from Heaven,
You must ""pray through"" like all the rest,
And showers shall be given."
990;In Christ Alone;Ab;"In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song

Firm through the fiercest drought 
  and storm
What heights of love, what depths 
  of peace
When fears are stilled, 
when strivings cease
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless Babe
This gift if love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
'Til on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then, bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home
Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand"

My burdens rolled away;
Rolled away, rolled away,

I remember when 
My burdens rolled away,
That I feared would never leave 
Night or day;

So I left them at the cross,
I was glad when 
My burdens rolled away.

Night and day;

Was more than I could bear,
He took them all away,
He took them all away.
And now on Him 
I roll my every care,
He took my sins away.

No condemnation 
Have I in my heart,
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.
His perfect peace 
He did to me impart,
He took my sins away.

If you will come 
To Jesus Christ today,
He'll take your sins away,
He'll take your sins away.
And keep you happy 
In His love each day,
He'll take your sins away."

This is my song.
Praising my Savior, 
All the day long;
This is my story, 
This is my song.
Praising my Savior, 
All the day long.

Perfect submission, 
Perfect delight!
Visions of rapture 
Now burst on my sight;
Angels, descending,

Echoes of mercy, 
Whispers of love.

Am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, 
Looking above,
Filled with His goodness, 
Lost in His love."
1047;Jesus Opened Up The Way;Ab;"Jesus Christ the Lord 
Opened up the way to glory
When He died to save us 
From our ruined state.
And He asks that we shall go
Tell the world the story,
How His blood will save them
From their awful fate.

Chorus
Jesus opened up 
The way to heaven's gate
When He died on the cross
To redeem all the lost;
He prepared the road 
That leads to His abode,
'Tis a road, marked by blood
But it leads us home to God.

And the way is marked
By the foot-prints of the Savior,
With His blood He made it,
Made it plain and straight;
If you walk that way,
It will lead you into heaven,
Lead you safely into 
Glory's golden gate.

Sinner, will you come and join
in this heav'nly journey,
Walk the bloody pathway 
That the Savior trod;
Then when life is over 
And all the sheaves are garnered,
You will meet the Savior 
and be not afraid."
5079;Master, The Tempest Is Raging;C;"Master, the tempest is raging! 
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o'er-shadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh;
""Carest Thou not that we perish?""
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

Chorus
""The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
Peace, be still!""
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
Or demons or men or whatever it be,
No water can swallow the ship where lies 
The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, be still! Peace be still! 
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, peace, be still!

Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
O waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul!
And I perish! I perish, dear Master; 
O hasten and take control!

Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast.
Linger, O blessed Redeemer, 
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
And rest on the blissful shore."

Oh, this bleeding Lamb,
Oh, this dying Lamb, 
He was found worthy;
Oh, this bleeding Lamb, 
Oh, this bleeding Lamb,
Oh, this dying Lamb, 
He was found worthy.

Worthy is the Lamb 
Who shed His precious blood
To restore a world 
To happiness and God;
""When no eye could pity 
And no arm could save,""
Jesus, for our ransom, 
Himself freely gave.

Worthy is the Lamb, 
The bleeding sacrifice 
Who for Adam's race 
Paid such a fearful price;
Worthy is the Lamb, 
The Paschal Lamb of God,
For the world received 
""Redemption thro' His blood.""

""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
Let men and angels sing, 
""Worthy is the Lamb,""

And when life is past, 
Upon the golden shore,
""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
We'll shout forevermore."

To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer,
nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now,
to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up
with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour,
That before Thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer,
and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love
that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy
that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee."

Whiter than the snow;
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;

Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."

A boundless and fathomless flood;

the shoreline,
And be lost in the fullness of God,

Chorus
Launch out into the deep,
Oh, let the shoreline go,
Launch out, launch out in the
ocean divine,
Out where the full tides flow.

But many, alas! only stand 
on the shore
And gaze on the ocean so wide;
They never have ventured its 
depths to explore,
Or to launch on the fathomless tide.

And others just venture away 
from the land,
And linger so near to the shore,
That the surf and the slime
that beat over the strand,
Dash o'er them in floods evermore.

Oh,let us launch out on this
ocean so broad,
Where the floods of salvation e'er flow;
Oh, let us be lost in the mercy of God,
Till the depths of His fullness we know."

While on others Thou art smiling,
Do not pass me by.

Chorus
Savior, Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Let me at a throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit, 
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heav'n but Thee?"

Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today,
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way;
Since the Savior found,
took away my sin
I have had the sunlight
of His love within.

Tho' clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows 'round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul.

While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigour on,
And leave the world behind.

I cross the wide-extended fields,
I journey o'er the plain,
And in the sunlight of His love
I reap the golden grain.

Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The Light that came to me;
Behold the brightness of His face,
Thro'out eternity."

CHORUS
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will over-spread the sky;
But when trav'ling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev'ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold."

Shall never thirst again.

Chorus
What! never thirst again?
No, never thirst again;
What! never thirst again? 
No, never thirst again,
For he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

Earth's fountains fair,
But mock our souls,
Like desert phantoms lure,
And they that drink,the fainter grow,
The keener thirst endure.

This stream from Calvary still flows,
To bless and cleanse and heal,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
New life and rest shall feel.

Oh, blessed stream of pure delight! 
Oh, balm for ev'ry pain! 
To thee I haste, for Jesus said,
I'll never thirst again."

Tho' they are slighting Him,
Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently;

Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried
That grace can restore:
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken
Will vibrate once more.

Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor
The Lord will provide:
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand'rer

Dispelling ev'ry doubt and fear,
Since I have been redeemed.

I have a home prepared for me,
Since I have been redeemed,
Where I shall dwell eternally,
Since I have been redeemed."

Tell it to me again;
Wonderful story of love;

Shepherds with wonder receive it;
Sinners, O won't you believe it?
Wonderful story  of love.

CHORUS
Wonderful ! Wonderful! Wonderful!
Wonderful story of love.

Wonderful story of love; 
Tho' you are far away;
Wonderful story of love; 
Still He doth call today;
Calling from Calvary's mountain,
Down from the crystal bright fountain,
E'en from the dawn of creation,
Wonderful story of love.

Wonderful story of love; 
Jesus provides a rest;
Wonderful story of love; 
For all the pure and blest,
Rest in those mansions above us,
With those who've gone on before us,
Singing the rapturous chorus,
Wonderful story of love."
680;The Hallelujah Side;G / Ab;"Once a sinner far from Jesus, 
I was perishing with cold,
But the blessed Savior 
Heard me when I cried;
Then He threw His robe around me, 
And He led me to His fold,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

CHORUS
Oh, glory be to Jesus, 
Let the hallelujahs roll;
Help me ring the Savior's praises 
far and wide,
For I've opened up tow'rd heaven 
All the windows of my soul,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Tho' the world may sweep around me
With her dazzle and her dreams,
Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,
For my soul looks up to heaven 
Where the golden sunlight gleams,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Not for all earth's golden millions
Would I leave this precious place,
Tho' the tempter to persuade me 
oft has tried,
For I'm safe in God's pavilion,
Happy in His love and grace,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Here the sun is always shining,
Here the sky is always bright;
'Tis no place for gloomy 
Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music 
And my heart with great delight,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

And upon the streets of Glory, 
When we reach the other shore,
And have safely crossed the Jordan's 
rolling tide,
You will find me shouting ""Glory"" 
Just outside my mansion door,
Where I'm living on the hallelujah side."
18;Onward, Christian Soldiers (OB 18);C / D;"Onward, Christian soldiers! 
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before,
Christ, the royal Master, 
Leads against the foe,
Forward into battle, 
See His banners go!

CHORUS
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.

Like a mighty army 
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading 
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided, 
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never 
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, 
Which can never fail.

At the sign of triumph,
Satan's host doth flee;
Oh, then, Christian Soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise!

Onward, then ye people! 
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honor, 
Unto Christ the King;
This thro' countless ages 
Men and angels sing."

conqueror's tread,
By faith they saw the victory ahead.

CHORUS
Victory ahead! Victory ahead!
Through the blood of Jesus, 
victory ahead;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I hear the conqueror's tread,
By faith I see the victory ahead.

David, with a shepherd's sling 
and five stones,
Met the giant on the field all alone;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He knew what God had said,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Daniel prayed unto the Lord 
thrice each day,
Then unto the lion's den led the way;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He did not fear or dread,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Often with the carnal mind I was tried,
Asking for deliverance oft I cried;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I reckoned I was dead,
By faith I saw the victory ahead.

When like those who've gone before 
to that land,
By death's river cold and dark 
I shall stand;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I will not fear or dread,
By faith I see the victory ahead."
6033;Waiting On The Lord;C;"Waiting on the Lord,

The blessed gospel light,
Let it shine from shore to shore!

The Macedonian call today
Send the light! Send the light!
And a golden offering 
At the cross we lay,
Send the light! Send the light!

Let us pray that grace 
May everywhere abound,
Send the light! Send the light!
And a Christ-like spirit 
Everywhere be found,
Send the light! Send the light!

In the work of love,
Send the light! Send the light!
Let us gather jewels 
For a crown above,
Send the light! Send the light!"
977;I'll Go Where You Want Me To Go;Eb;"It may not be on the mountain's height,
Or over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle's front
My Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still, small voice He calls
To paths I do not know,
I'll answer dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I'll go where you want me to go.

Chorus
I'll go where you want me to go , dear Lord
O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord,
I'll be what you want me to be.

Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand'rer whom I should seek,
Oh Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide, 
Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I'll say what you want me to say.

There's surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth's harvest-fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life's short day
For Jesus, the Crucified.
So, trusting my all unto Thy care, 
I know Thou lovest me!
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what you want me to be."
205;Near The Cross;F;"Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

CHORUS
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."
6036;Send The Fire;Eb;"Thou Christ of burning, cleansing flame,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
Thy blood bought gift today we claim,

We want another Pentecost,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

God of Elijah, hear our cry,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
He'll make us fit to live or die,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
To burn up every trace of sin,
To bring the light and glory in,
The revolution now begin,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

'Tis fire we want, for fire we plead,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
The fire will meet our every need,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
For strength to ever do the right,
For grace to conquer in the fight,
For power to walk in the world in white,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!"
6037;Throw Out The Life-Line;F;"Throw out the Life-Line 
Across the dark wave,
There is a brother 
Whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother! 
Oh, who then will dare
To throw out the Life-Line, 
His peril to share?

Chorus
Throw out the Life-Line! 
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is drifting away!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is sinking today.

Throw out the Life-Line 
With hand quick and strong;
Why do you tarry, 
Why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; 
Oh hasten today
And out with the Life-Boat! 
Away, then, away!

Throw out the Life-Line 
To danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish 
Where you've never been;
Winds of temptation 
And billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out 
Where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season 
Of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift 
To eternity's shore;
Haste then,my brother, 
No time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line 
And save them today."

to earth again,

To earth's sorrowing cry,
For the knowledge of the Lord shall fill
The earth and sea and sky;
God shall take away all sickness 
And the sufferer's tears will dry,
When our Savior shall come back 
to earth again.

Yes, the ransomed of the Lord shall come 
To Zion then with joy,
And in all His holy mountain 
Nothing hurts or shall destroy;
Perfect peace shall reign in every heart,
and love without alloy,
After Jesus shall come back 
to earth again.

Then the sin and sorrow, pain and death
of  this dark world shall cease,
In a glorious reign with Jesus of a
thousand years of peace;
All the earth is groaning, crying 
For that day of sweet release,
For our Jesus to come back 
to earth again."

Under the blood, under the blood;
And work in me to do Thy will,

Through the mountains makes a way;
Findeth water in the desert,

Roll throughout eternity;
Though earth hinders and hell rages,
All must work for good to thee."

I'm hiding in Thee.

CHORUS
Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noontide,
In sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation
Casts o'er me its power;
In the tempests of life,
On its wide heaving sea,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict,
When pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and
Breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials
Like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee,
Oh Thou Rock of my soul."

Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.

CHORUS
How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!

For me it was in the garden
He prayed, ""Not My will, but Thine,""
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me."

Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story softly, 
That I may take it in,
That wonderful redemption,  
God's remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often, 
For I forget so soon,
The early dew of morning, 
Has passed away at noon.

Tell me the same old story 
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory 
Is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world's glory 
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell  me the old, old story: 
Christ Jesus makes thee whole."
157;I've Anchored In Jesus;Ab;"Upon life's boundless ocean 
Where mighty billows roll,
I've fixed my hope in Jesus, 
Blest anchor of my soul;
When trials fierce assail me 
As storms are gathering o'er,
I rest upon His mercy 
And trust Him more.

CHORUS
I've anchored in Jesus, 
The storms of life I'll brave,
I've anchored in Jesus, 
I fear no wind or wave,
I've anchored in Jesus, 
For He hath power to save,
I've anchored to the Rock of Ages.

He keeps my soul from evil 
And gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters 
And bid their tumult cease;
My pilot and deliverer, 
To Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him, 
He's at my side,

He is my Friend and Savior, 
In Him my anchor's cast,

And shields me from the blast;
By faith I'm looking upward 
Beyond life's troubled sea,
There I behold a haven 
Prepared for me."

On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

CHORUS
Sing, oh, sing, of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell

I will sing of my  Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be."
6045;Let The Lower Lights Be Burning;Ab;"Brightly beams our Father's mercy
From His lighthouse evermore,
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.

CHORUS
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave!
Some poor fainting, struggling sea-man
You may rescue, you may save.

Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;
Some poor sailor tempest tossed,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost."

That rears to heav'n its head sublime;
That Rock is cleft, and they are blest

Chorus
Some build their hopes on the 
ever drifting sand,
Some on their fame, or their treasure, 
or their land;
Mine's on a Rock that forever will stand,
Jesus, the ""Rock of Ages.""

That Rock's a cross, its arms outspread,
Celestial glory bathes its head;
To its firm base my all I bring,
And to the Rock of Ages cling.

That Rock's a tow'r, whose lofty height,
Illum'd with heav'n's unclouded light,
Opes wide its gate beneath the dome
Where saints find rest with Christ at home."
171;WONDERFUL PEACE (OB 171);F / Ab;"Far away in the depths

Peace! peace! wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray
In fathomless billows of love.

What a treasure I have 
In this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul;
So secure that no power 
Can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll.

I am resting tonight 
In this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus' control;
For I'm kept from all danger 
By night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul.

And me thinks when I rise 
To that city of peace,
Where the author of peace 
I shall see,
That one strain of the song 
Which the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom shall be:

Ah! soul, are you here 
Without comfort or rest,
Marching down the rough 
Pathway of time?
Make Jesus your friend 
Ere the shadows grow dark;

Peace so sublime."

Before the cross I bow, 
upon the altar lay
A willing offering now, 
my all from day to day.
My Savior paid the price,  
my name He sweetly calls;
Upon the sacrifice the fire 
from heaven falls.

No good that I have done, 
His promise I embrace;
Accepted in the Son, 
He saves me by His grace.
All glory be to God! 
let hallelujahs roll;
His love is shed abroad, 
the fire is in my soul."

His burden is light,
I've found it so, 
I've found it so;
He leadeth me 
By day and by night,
Where living waters flow.

My soul crieth out: 
""Restore me again,
And give me 
The strength to take
The narrow path 
of righteousness,
E'en for Thine own 
name's sake.""

Yea, though I should walk 
The valley of death,
Yet what should I fear from ill?

Thy rod and staff support me still."

Jesus loves me,
And I know I love Him;
Love brought Him down
My poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was love made 
Him die on the tree;
Oh, I am certain that 
Jesus loves me!

In this assurance 
I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus, 
I know I am blessed;
Satan, dismayed, from my 
Soul now doth flee,
When I just tell him that
Jesus loves me.

Oh, if there's only one 
Song I can sing,
When in His beauty 
I see the  great King,
This shall my song 
In eternity be:
""Oh, what a wonder 
That Jesus loves me.""

If one should ask of me, 
How can I tell?
Glory to Jesus, 
I know very well!
God's Holy Spirit 
With mine doth agree,
Constantly witnessing 
Jesus loves me.

Tho' I forget Him 
And wander away,
Still He doth love me 
Wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving 
Arms would I flee,
When I remember 
That Jesus loves me."

Where can mortal be more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And, when weary, find sweet rest;

While I from his fullness gather
Grace and comfort every day.

As I sit low at Thy feet;

It speaks! polluted nature dies!
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

I rise to walk in heav'n's own light
Above the world and sin,
With heart made pure, and 
garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

Amazing grace! 'tis heav'n below
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus know,
My Jesus crucified."

Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the outer court,
Oh glory be to God!
I am all on Jesus' side,
On the altar sanctified,
To the world and sin I've died,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

CHORUS
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I have passed the riven veil,
Where the glories never fail,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I am living in the presence 
of the King.

I'm a king and priest to God,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
By the cleansing of the blood,
Oh glory be to God!
By the Spirit's pow'r and light,
I am living day and night,
In the holiest place so bright,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I have passed the outer veil,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
Which did once God's light conceal,
Oh glory be to God!
But the blood has brought me in
To God's holiness so clean,
Where there's death to self and sin,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I'm within the holiest pale,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the inner veil,
Oh glory be to God!
I am sanctified to God
By the power of the blood,
Now the Lord is my abode,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!"
2;Amazing Grace (OB 2);F;"Amazing grace!
How sweet the sound.
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost,
but now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught
my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did
that grace appear
the hour I first believed;

Through many dangers,
toils and snares,
I have already come.
'Tis grace that brought 
me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home.

When we've been there
ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
we've no less days
to sing God's praise
than when we first begun.

Praise God, Praise God, ..."
146;At The Cross (OB 146);Eb / F;"Alas, and did my Savior Bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

CHORUS
At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart, 
rolled away,
It was there by faith, 
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day.

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
Tis all that I can do!"
770;Come Unto Me;C;"Hear the blessed Savior 
calling the oppressed,
""Oh ye heavy-laden, come 
to Me and rest;
Come, no longer tarry, 
I your load will bear,
Bring Me ev'ry burden, 
bring Me ev'ry care.""

Chorus
Come unto Me, 
I will give you rest;
Take My yoke upon you, 
Hear Me and be blest;
I am meek and lowly,
Come and trust My might;
Come, My yoke is easy,
And My burden's light.

Are you disappointed, 
wand'ring here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt 
and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle
in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus, 
He will give you rest.

Stumbling on the mountains 
dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling tow'rd the pit
of hell's consuming flame,
By the pow'rs of sin 
deluded and oppressed, 
Hear the tender Shepherd,
""Come to Me and rest.""

Have you by temptation 
often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness 
brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you, 
if you'll claim His best,
In the Holy Spirit, 
He will give you rest."
168;WHERE HE LEADS ME (OB 168);Eb / F;"I can hear my Savior calling,
I can hear my Savior calling,
I can hear my Savior calling,
""Take thy cross and follow, follow Me.""

CHORUS
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
And go with me, with me all the way."
47;I Know Whom I  Have Believed (OB 47);C;"I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

CHORUS
But I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day.

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus thro' the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air."
907;I Believe Jesus Saves;F;"I am coming to Jesus for rest,
Rest, such as the purified know;
My soul is athirst to be blest,
To be washed and made 
whiter than snow.

CHORUS
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
whiter than snow;
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
whiter than snow.

In coming, my sin I deplore,
My weakness and poverty show;
I long to be saved evermore,
To be washed and made 
whiter than snow.

To Jesus I give up my all,
Every treasure and idol I know;
For His fullness of blessing I call,
Till His blood washes 
whiter than snow"
53;Sweet By And By (OB 53);F / G;"There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

CHORUS
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days."
101;When I survey the cross ( 0B 101);F;"When I survey the wondrous cross,
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all."
6079;The Old Account Settled;Ab;"There was a time on earth, 
When in the book of heaven
An old account was standing
For sins yet unforgiven;
My name was at the top, 
And many things below,
I went unto the keeper, 
And settled long ago.

CHORUS
Long ago, long ago, 
Yes the old account 
Was settled long ago;
And the record's clear today, 
For He washed my sins away,
When the old account 
Was settled long ago.

The old account was large, 
And growing every day,
For I was always sinning, 
And never tried to pay;
But when I looked ahead, 
And saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle,
I settled long ago.

When at the judgment bar, 
I stand before my King,
And He the book will open, 
He cannot find a thing;
Then will my heart be glad, 
While tears of joy will flow
Because I had it settled, 
And settled long ago.

When in that happy home, 
My Savior's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story, 
And praise Him for His love;
I'll not forget that book, 
With pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled, 
And settled long ago.

O sinner, seek the Lord, 
Repent of all your sin,
For thus He hath commanded, 
If you would enter in;
And then if you should live 
A hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it, 
You settled long ago."
6077;Stand Up For Jesus;G;"Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
ye soldiers of the cross,
Lift high His royal banner, 
it must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory, 
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished 
and Christ is Lord  indeed.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict, 
in this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him, 
against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, 
and strength to strength oppose.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus; 
stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you - 
ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor, 
and watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger, 
be never wanting there.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus:
The strife will not be long
This day the noise of battle
The next the victor's song;
To him that overcometh ,
A crown of life shall be;
He with the King of glory
Shall reign eternally."
62;Yesterday, Today, Forever (OB 62);G;"Oh, how sweet the glorious message, 
simple faith may claim;
Yesterday today, forever,
Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful, 
heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest; 
Glory to His name!

CHORUS
Yesterday, today, forever, 
Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never! 
Glory to His name,
Glory to His name, Glory to his name;
All may change but Jesus never! 
Glory to His name.

He who was the friend of sinners, 
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at 
His footstool penitently bow.
He who said, ""I'll not condemn thee, 
go and sin no more;""
Speaks to thee that word of pardon, 
as in days of yore.

Oft on earth He healed the sufferer 
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows 
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue, 
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His fullness 
Still will give as much.

As of old He walked to Emmaus, 
with them to abide;
So through all life's way He walketh, 
ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him, 
hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be this same Jesus, 
as He went away.

He who ´mid the raging billows,
walked upon the sea;
still can hush our wildest tempest,
as on Galilee.
He who wept and prayed in anguish,
in Gethsemane,
drinks with us each cup of trembling,
in our agony.

As of old He walked to Emmaus
with them to abide;
so through all life´s way He walketh,
ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him,
hasten, Lord, the day!
But ´twill still be ""this same Jesus"",
as He went away."

Revive us again.

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior,
And scattered our night.

To the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins
And has cleansed ev'ry stain.

Revive us again;
Fill each heart with Thy love,
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above."
222;Take The Name Of Jesus With You (OB 222);F;"Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it, then, where'er you go.

CHORUS
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

Take the name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

Oh the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him
When our journey is complete."
6081;Look To The Lamb Of God;F;"If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God;
He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.

CHORUS
Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,
For He alone is able to save you;
Look to the Lamb of God.

When Satan tempts, 
and doubts and fears assail,
Look to the Lamb of God;
You in His strength 
Shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you aweary, 
Does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer 
And fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows 
On your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow 
Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God."
220;Blest Be The Tie That Binds (OB 220);F;"Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, 
our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be 
joined in heart,
And hope to meet again."
165;WHEN THEY RING THE BELLS (0B 165);Eb / Bb;"There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore 
By faith's decree;
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells
for you and me.

CHORUS
Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee.
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells
for you and me.

We shall know no sin nor sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond
the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells
for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
When in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the spirit
to be free
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Aiden,
When they ring the golden bells
for you and me."
1057;Jesus, Lover Of My Soul;F;"Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high!
Hide me, oh my Savior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:
Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me!
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, oh Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
False and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace."
1061;Joy To The World!;C;"Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.

Joy to the world! the Savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills
and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, and wonders of His love."

6087;Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem;Eb;"Oh little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by:
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary;
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Oh holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend on us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today.
We hear the holy angels
The great glad tidings tell;
Oh come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel."
1001;It Came Upon The Midnight Clear;Bb;"It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
From heaven's all-gracious King:""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still thro' the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
Oh rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing.

For lo, the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the evercircling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing."
738;Away In A Manger;F;"Away in a manger,
No crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus,
Asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing,
The Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
No crying He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle,
Till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever,
And love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And take us to heaven,
To live with Thee there."

The harvest is passing away;
Your Savior is longing to bless you;

I shall forever lift
  my eyes to Calvary,
to view the cross where

   I can clearly see
I'll shout it from the mountains
  and the valleys
He looked beyond my faults
  and saw my needs

And for today I humbly seek

Had it not been for a place called mount
Calvary
Had it not been for the old rugged cross
Had it not been for a man called Jesus
Then forever my soul would be lost

Drink that bitter cup
Although He prayed ""Father let it pass from me""
And I'm so glad He never called
Heaven's Angels ""From my hands
Pull the nails that torment me"""

59;The Circuit Rider (OB 59);G;"The circuit-rider preacher 
  went riding through the land, 
With a rifle on his shoulder 
  and a Bible in his hand; 
He told the prairie people 
  of a blessed Promised Land, 
As he went riding, singing along.

Leaning, leaning, 
Leaning on the everlasting arm; 
Leaning, leaning, 
Leaning on the everlasting arm.

He preached the coming judgment 
  of fire and brimstone; 
And a glorious, endless Heaven 
  of the justified alone,
As he rode across the mountains 
you could hear him sing this song, 
As he went riding on.

There is power, power, 
wonder-working power, 
In the blood of the Lamb; 
There is power, power, 
wonder-working power, 
In the precious blood of the Lamb.

His rifle's old and rusty, 
  and it's hanging on the wall; 
His Bible's worn and dusty, 
  and it's seldom touched at all: 
But his Message from this Bible 
will meet us at Judgment Day, 
For God's Truth keeps marching on.

600;Jesus Signed My Pardon;D;"I was in sin and prison
oh, so dark and cold,
like a lost sheep wandering
from God`s eternal fold.
Then the door wung open
and He spoke to me:
""I have signed your pardon,
now you may go free""

CHORUS
Jesus signed my pardon
this I surely know,
He took my place on calvary
now I won`t have to go.
All my life I give to Him,
He gave His life for me,
when He signed my pardon, 
there at calvary.

When my Saviour led me
from that awful place,
I could hear the saint
they sing: Amazing grace.
Now I know, I`m pardoned
from my sin and shame
and I`ll join them, singing:
Glory to his name.

Sinner friend that`s wandering
from that blessed fold,
Jesus died for you
to save your sinsick soul.
No more in satan`s prison
do you now belong.
Can`t you hear Him calling:
""Now you may come home"""

3;They Come (OB 3);Eb;"They come from the east and west,
They come from the lands afar.
To feast with the King,
To dine as His guest,
How blessed these pilgrims are!
Beholding His hallowed face
Aglow with light divine;
Blest partakers of His grace,
As gems in His crown to shine.

Chorus
Since Jesus has set me free,
I'm happy as heart can be.
No longer I bear
The burden of care,
His yoke is so sweet to me.
My soul was as black as night,
But darkness has taken flight;
Now I shout the victory,
For Jesus set me free.

I look on the great white throne,
Before it the ransom'd stand;
No longer are tears
No sorrow is known
Nor death in that goodly land.
My savior has gone before,
preparing the way for me,
Soon we'll meet to part no more
Through time or eternity.

The gates of that holy place.
Stand open by night and day;
O look to the Lord
Who ""giveth more grace""
Whose love has prepared the way.
A home in those mansions fair
His hand has reserved for all.
For the wedding feast prepare,
Obeying the gracious call.

Oh, Jesus is coming soon,
Our trials will then be o'er.
What if our Lord
This moment should come.
For those who are free from sin?
Then would it bring you joy,
Or sorrow and deep despair?
When our Lord in glory comes,
We'll meet Him up in the air."
4;I love Him (OB 4);C;"Gone from my heart,
the world and all its charms;
Now, through the blood
I'm saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross
my heart is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus
cleanses white as snow.

Chorus
I love Him, I love Him,
Because He first loved me
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary's tree

Once I was lost,
and 'way down deep in sin;
Once was a slave
to passions fierce within;
Once was afraid
to trust a loving God;
But now I'm cleansed from every
stain through Jesus' blood.

Once I was bound,
but now I am set free;
Once I was blind,
but now the light I see;
Once I was dead,
but now in Christ I live;
To tell the world around the peace
that He doth give."
8;Oh I want to see Him (OB 8);F / G;"As I journey through the land,
singing as I go,
pointing souls to calvary,
to the crimson flow.
Many arrows pierce my soul
from without, within.
But my Lord leads me on,
through Him I must win.

Chorus
Oh, I want to see Him,
look upon His face.
There to sing forever
of His saving grace.
On the streets of glory
let me lift my voice,
cares all past, home at last,
ever to rejoice.

When in service for my Lord,
dark may be the night,
but I`ll cling more close to Him,
He will give me light.
Satan's snares may vex my soul,
turn my thoughts aside;
but my Lord goes ahead,
leads whate'er betide.

When in valleys low I look
toward the mountain height,
and behold my Saviour there,
leading in the fight.
With a tender hand outstretched
toward the valley low,
guiding me, I can see,
as I onward go.

When before me billows rise
from the mighty deep,
then my Lord directs my path,
He doth safely keep.
And He leads me gently on
through this world below,
He's a real Friend to me,
Oh, I love Him so."
10;Teach me, Lord to wait;F;"Teach me, Lord,
to wait down on my knees,
till in Your own good time
You answer my pleas.
Teach me not to rely
on what others do,
but to wait in prayer
for an answer from You.

Chorus
They that wait upon the Lord,
shall renew their strength,
they shall mount up with wings
as an eagle,
they shall run and not be weary,
they shall walk and not faint.
Teach me, Lord,
teach me, Lord, to wait.

Teach me, Lord, to wait
while hearts are aflame,
help me humble my pride
and call on Your name.
Keep my faith renewed,
keep my eyes on Thee,
help me be on this earth
what You want me to be.

Teach me, Lord, to wait
and to stand on Thy word,
that I hear what you say
and I see what you mean:
That the Spoken Word
is the original seed
and that nothing can help me
but only Thy word."

Wear a crown, wear a crown.
Wear a bright and shining crown.
And when the batte's over
We shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Must I be carried to the skies
On flow`ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God?

Sure I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord.
I`ll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word."

Grace that will
Pardon and cleans within.
Grace, grace, God`s grace,
Grace that is greater
Than all our sin

Sin and despair like
The sea waves cold,
Theaten the soul
With infinite loss.
Grace that is greater,
Yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge,
The mighty cross.

Dark is the stain
That we cannot hide,
What can avail
To wash it away?
Look, there is flowing
A crimson tide,
Whiter than snow
You may be tonight.

Marvelous, infinite,
Matchless grace,
Freely bestowed
On all who believe.
You that are longing
To see His face,
Wll you this moment 
His grace receive?"

When our Lord shall come again?

Chorus
There'll be singing, there'll be shouting,
There'll be sorrow, there'll be pain,
There'll be weeping, there'll be praying,
When our Lord shall come again.

Will His coming bring rejoicing?
Or will it bring tears and pain?
Are you ready to receive Him,
When our Lord shall come again?

Will you join in lamentation?
Or the angel`s glad refrain?
Will you help His people crown Him,
When our Lord shall come again?

Work and pray till Jesus calls you,
Help to gather in the grain,
Then with joy  you`ll meet the Saviour,
When our Lord shall come again"
22;Victory in Jesus (OB 22);F;"I heard and old, old story,
how a Saviour came from glory,
how he gave His life on Calvary
to safe a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning,
of His precious blood`s atoning,
then I repented of my sins
and won the victory.

Chorus
O victory in Jesus,
my Saviour forever,
He sought me and bought me
with His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him,
and all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing,
of His cleansing pow`r revealing,
how he made the lame to walk again
and caused the blind to see;
and then I cried:``Dear Jesus,
come and heal my broken spirit.``,
and somehow Jesus came and brought 
to me the victory.

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory,
and I heard about the streets of gold 
beyond the crystal sea;
about the angels singing ,
and the old redemption story,
and some sweet day I`ll sing up there
the song of victory."

To heal the sinner in his brokeness
To offer healing and forgiveness
And those who trust in Him
Will find their heart at rest"

When I see the blood,
I will pass, I will pass over you.

Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save;
All He has promised, that He will do;
Wash in the fountain opened for sin,

love lifted me!

All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I cling,
In His blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing.
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul`s best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belongs.

calleth, ""come and dine"",

table all the time.
He who fed the multitude,
turned the water into wine,
to the hungry calleth now,
""Come and dine.""

The disciples came to land,
thus obeying Christ`s command,
for the Master called
to them, ""come and dine"".
There they found their hearts desire,
bread and fish upon the fire.
Thus He satisfies
the hungry every time.

will assembled be.

Though millions have found Him a friend
and have turned from the sins they have
sinned,
the Saviour still waits to open the gates,

Chorus
He was wounded for 
  our transgressions
He was bruis'd for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price of healing was paid,
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgment hall.
Now His suff'ring affords
Perfect healing for all.
This wonderful Healer's mine

Came the leper to Christ
Saying ""surely I know, that Thou, 
Lord, canst make me whole.""
When his great faith was seen
Jesus said, ""Yes, I will!""
And touch'd him and made him clean.

He has healed my sick soul,
Made me ev'ry whit whole,
And He'll do the same for you.
He's the same yesterday
And today and for aye,
This Healer of men today."

when my Saviour takes me to His home.

CHORUS
When I take my vacation in heaven,
what a wonderful time that will be;
hearing concerts by heavenly chorus,
and the face of my Saviour I´ll see;
sitting down by the banks of the river;
´neath the shade of the ever green tree,
I shall rest from my burdens forever,
won´t you spend your vacation with me.

Now some day I shall take my vacation
to the city John tells us about;
with its foundation walls all so precious,
where from gladness of heart I shall shout!
Oh, no sights ever witnessed by mortals
can compare with the glories up there,
I shall spend my vacation with Jesus,
in the place He went on to prepare.

There the weather will always be perfect,
not a cloud shall sweep over the sky;
and no earthquakes or cyclones
shall threaten,
in the land of the ""Sweet by and by"".
Soon there´s going to be an excursion,
I am booked for a ride in the air,
you´re invited to share my vacation
and the feast with our Bridegroom to share.

Here so many are taking vacation,
to the mountains, the lake or the sea;
where they rest from their cares
and their worries,
what a wonderful time that must be!
But it seems not my lot to be like them,
I must toil thru the heat and the cold,
seeking out the lost sheep
on the mountains,
bringing wanderers back to the fold."
111;What then? (OB 111);F;"When the great plants of our cities
have turned out their last finished work,
when our merchants
have sold their last yard of goods
and dismissed the last tired clerk,
when our banks have rakes
in their last dollar
and paid the last dividends,
when the judge of the earth says
""closed for the night""
and asks for a balance - What Then?

CHORUS
What then? What then?
When the great Book is opened,
what then?
When the ones that´s rejecting
this Message tonight,
will be asked to give a reason-
What Then?

When the choir has sung its last song
and the preacher has said his last prayer,
when the people have heard
their last sermon
and the sound has died out in the air,
when the Bible lies closed on the altar
and the pews are all empty of folks,
and each one stands facing his record 
and the great Book is opened -
What Then?

When the actors have played their last drama
and the mimic has made his last fun,
when the film has flashed its last film
and the billboard displayed its last run,
when the crowds seeking pleasure
have vanished
and all the liquor stores and beer
joints have been closed,
and the salesman sold his last drink
and gone out in the darkness,
when the trumpet of ages is sounded
and we stand before Him-What Then?

When the bugle call sinks into silence
and the long marching columns stand still,
and the captain repeats his last orders,
and the flag has been hauled from the mast,
and the wounded afield checked in
and a world that rejects its Saviour
is asked for a reason-What Then?"
120;ROOM AT THE FOUNTAIN (0B 120);C;"I heard my loving Saviour say,

Room at the fountain for thee;
Room, room, yes, there is room,
There´s room at the fountain for thee.

I came to Him, my sins confessed,
There was room at the fountain for me;
When I gave up, my heart was blest,
There´s room at the fountain for thee.

I plunged beneath the crimson tide,
There was room at the fountain for me;
And now by faith am sanctified,
There´s room at the fountain for thee.

I found the crimson stream I know,
There was room at the fountain for me;
His blood has washed me white as snow,
There´s room at the fountain for thee.

He cleansed my heart from inbred sin,
There was room at the fountain for me;
And now he keeps me pure within,
There´s room at the fountain for thee.

I´ll praise Him while He gives me breath,
There was room at the fountain for me;
He saved me from an awful death,
There´s room at the fountain for thee."
129;Baptized into the body (OB 129);F / G;"Have you been baptized 
  into the body?
Baptized with the 
 Holy Ghost;

Just as they did 
 on pentecost.

CHORUS
Are you in the 
church, triumphant?
Are you in the 
Saviour's Bride?
Come and be baptized 
into the body,
and forevermore abide.

There is but one Church, 
 Bride or Body, 
And into it 
 we're all baptized;
By the one, true, 
 promised Holy Spirit;
Though by the world 
 we're all despised.

Every creed has 
 claimed to be the body,
But the ""plumb line""  proved 
 untrue 
All their dreams, for 
 God has so determined
To bring His Son´s 
 true Bride to view.

Many thought that they 
 were in the body,
'Till the Holy Ghost had come;
When the Word of God was 
 opened to them, 
They entered in, 
 and yet there's room.

Those who died before 
 the Holy Spirit
Came upon us from 
 on high, 
May, by faith with Saints 
 of old departed,
Arise to meet Him in the sky.

Oh, if today God should call it away,
what would you give
in exchange for your soul?

Mercy is calling you,
won´t you give heed?
Must the dear Saviour still tenderly plead?
Risk not your soul, it is precious indeed;
what would you give
in exchange for your soul?

More than the silver and gold of the earth,
more than all jewels thy spirit is worth!
God, the Creator, has given it birth!
What would you give
in exchange for your soul?

If, when you stand at the bar by and by,
when you are weighed
in the balance on high,
you should be sentenced forever to die,
what would you give
in exchange for your soul?"

All tears forever over,
 in God´s eternal day.

CHORUS
It will be worth it all,
 when we see Jesus;
Life´s trials will seem so small,
 when we see Christ;
One glimpse of His dear face,
 all sorrow will erase,
So bravely run the race 
  till we see Christ.

Sometimes the sky looks dark,
  with not a ray of light;
We´re tossed and driven on,
 no human help in sight;
But there is One in heaven,
  who knows our deepest care,
Let Jesus solve your problem,
  just go to Him in prayer.

Life´s day will soon be o´er,
  all storms forever past;
We´ll cross the great divide,
  to glory safe at last;
We´ll share the joys of heaven,
  a harp, a home, a crown;
The tempter will be banished,
  we´ll lay our burdens down."

No tongue can bid me thence depart

Upward I look and see Him there 
Who made an end of all my sin 
Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
To look on Him and pardon me 
To look on Him and pardon me

Behold Him there, the risen Lamb 
My perfect, spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM

hoarded resources,
our Father's full giving is only begun.

Communion with Him,

I've not done it

Justified, justified,
I've not done it
in the first place, justified.


I was sitting alone and wondering
About what I'm supposed to do,
I can't deny the times I've made 
mistakes,
I can't hide from Him, He knew;
But I knew that deep within my soul
I felt sorry, honest I do,
So I just cried and said, ""Forgive me 
Lord,
Forgive me Lord, will you?""

So often I'm discouraged
When I count the times I fall,
'Cause he promised I'd be 
victorious
When I know I'm not at all;
Then I heard an eagle scream,
Its voice quickened my soul,
He said, ""you've not done it in 
the first place, you're justified.""

He looked at your perfect picture
Without blame, spot or wrinkle,
He didn't look at you from where 
you are now,
He looked from eternity,
He said you're just trapped in that 
body,
You bypassed your theophany;
You have not done it in the 
first place, you're justified.

where could I go but to the Lord?

Where could I go, oh, where could I go?
Seeking a refuge for my soul?
Needing a friend to help me in the end,
where could I go but to the Lord?

Neighbours are kind, 
I love them every one,
we get along in sweet accord;
but when my soul
needs manna from above,
where could I go but to the Lord?

Life here is grand with friends
I love so dear,
comfort I get from God's own Word;
yet when I face
the chilling hand of death,
where could I go but to the Lord?"

That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

There's nothing like an old-time Christian
With a Christian love to show;
I'm walking in the grand old highway,
And I'm telling everywhere I go,
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

There are many things I'd like to be
As my journey I pursue,
I have longed to be a leader
Like a mortal man would do;
I would like to be a millionaire,
With a million to bestow.
But I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

All the world is bright since I got right.
Now I sing and pray and shout,
all my burdens have been lifted
since the Saviour brought me out;
I will tell the world both far and near
as I travel here below,
that I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know."

Gott ist derselbe,
Sein Wort ist unwandelbar.
Er bahnt dir Wege

Berge versetzen,

fly across the lonely years;
and old home scenes of my childhood,
in fond memory appear.

In the stillness of the midnight,
echoes from the past I hear;
old-time singing, gladness bringing,
from that lovely land somewhere.

As I travel on life`s pathway,
know not what the years may hold;
as I ponder, hope grows fonder,
precious memories flood my soul.

Precious memories of the prophet,
flood my soul from day to day,
I remember scenes so precious
that can never pass away.

I`ve heard the message and its signal
that day`s end is near at hand,
but I remember that He promised
He`d return for those who`d stand.

Precious memories, glorious meetings
across this land from sea to sea
where I heard the prophet`s message
that brought life and hope to me.

Precious memories in this storehouse
where the food was laid away,
we`ve returned to where he stored it,
spiritual food against this day."

To overcome my trials;

And his desire to steal away my faith.
But i have found in time the Revelation:
The strength I need to keep me in his Grace."

Steps unto heaven;

Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer to Thee!

Or if, on joyful wing,
Cleaving the sky.

Upward I fly.

und Er führt mich an der Hand.

Was mir morgen schon begegnet,
ahn` ich nicht, kann`s nicht erseh`n.
Doch der heut` mich reich gesegnet,
wird auch morgen mit mir geh`n.

Auf dem gold`nen Weg zum Leben
wird die Bürde sanft und leicht.
Hinter Wolken, die da schweben,
glänzt das Licht das nimmer weicht.
Über Bergen hoch erhaben,
über`m Regenbogen weit,
strahlt die schönste aller Gaben,
Er die Sonn` der Herrlichkeit.

Was die Seele auch beweget,
mag es Not und Armut sein.
Der den Sperling nährt und pfleget,
lässt mich nimmermehr allein.
Auf dem Pfad, den Er bereitet,
sei`s durch Feuer oder Flut,
folg` ich Ihm, Der mich geleitet,
und mich deckt mit Seinem Blut."

CHORUS
Many things about tomorrow.
I don`t seem to understand;
but I know who holds tomorrow,
and I know who holds my hand. 

Ev`ry step is getting brighter,
as the golden stairs I climb;
ev`ry burden`s getting lighter;
ev`ry cloud is silver lined.
There the sun is always shining,
there no tear will dim the eye,
at the ending of the rainbow,
where the mountains touch the sky.

I don`t know about tomorrow,
it may bring me poverty;
but the One who feeds the sparrow,
is the One who stands by me.
And the path that be my portion,
may be through the flame or flood,
but His presence goes before me,
and I`m covered with His blood."

where a baby was born,

his parents told him,
about the mysterious light 
that came in.

CHORUS
Alone and forsaken by faith and by man
till an angel came down,
so he would understand.
He was God`s chosen man!

One day he was resting 
beneath an old, old tree, 
when he noticed a whirlwind
rustling the leaves. 
He thought nothing strange, 
but when he started to go,
a big voice came forth and here is 
what He spoke: 
""Don`t drink, nor smoke,
defile your body in any way.
I`ve got a work for you later,
I`ll show you same day.""

At the age of seven, 
God showed him a vision,
about a bridge being built,
later on was fulfilled.
On the Ohio river
where the bridge now stands,
there the mysterious cloud
came down again.
As he baptized his seventeenth
person that day,
thousands were there
to witness that day.

About the story I told you,
I know there is more,
he was the fulfillment of Malachi 4.
Now if there`s a doubt in your mind
what you heard,
dont`t take it from me,
check it out with the Word.

God will show you that it`s plain,
that William Branham
is this man`s name!"

Gib mir das Feuer

Die göttliche Liebe ist Balsam fürs Herz.
So wunderbar stillt sie mein Weh;
Sie heilt meine Krankheit
und lindert den Schmerz,
macht weißer im Blut mich als Schnee.

ohne Murren, ohne Trotz,

Wo ich´s selber wollte zwingen 
und es wagen ohne Dich,
ach, da sanken mir die Schwingen
meines Mutes jämmerlich, 
aber wo ich stille hielt,
hast Du stets mein Heil erzielt.

Ward es anders auch gewendet,
ging´s durch manches Dunkel oft,
immer hat es gut geendet, 
besser, als ich´s je gehofft,
besser als bei Tag und Nacht
ich´s im Herzen ausgedacht.

Darum will ich stille halten

was heilsam ist und gut?

Ich weiß, dass Sein Erbarmen
ganz unaussprechlich ist,
dass Er den ärmsten Armen

Ich weiß, Sein Liebeswille
ist meine Heilgung nur;
drum will ich halten stille
und folgen Seiner Spur.

Will auch nicht ängstlich flehen;
Herr, gib mir dies und das!
O nein, war Er ersehen, 
das ich mir auch erlas.
Ist auch der Weg verborgen, 
der heim mich führen soll,

den Führer kenn ich wohl.

Jawohl, Er blickt hernieder auf mich,

Jesus, der Getreue, in dem ich mich freue,

von dem Sündenschlafe,

eine lange Strafe.
Und die Not samt dem Tod

Wache auf, sonst kann dich nicht

Wache, sonsten wird Sein Licht

Wie habe ich so bange

Ich ging, ich ging hinein.

Drum schweigt, ihr Erdentöne,

In seiner Marterschöne 
steht vor mir Jesu Bild.
Der Vorhang war durchbrochen 
in Gottes Macht,
als er im Tod gesprochen: 
"" Es ist, es ist vollbracht!
Es ist, es ist vollbracht!""

Im Heiligtum zu bleiben
ist mein Beruf fortan.
Nicht Eignes soll mich treiben:

Sieh, darum musste Christus leiden,
Damit du könntest selig sein.

Und diesen Gott sollt ich nicht ehren

Er sollte rufen, ich nicht hören?
Den Weg, den Er mir zeigt, nicht gehen?
Sein Will ist mir ins Herz geschrieben,
Sein Wort bestärkt ihn ewiglich:
Gott soll ich über alles lieben
Und meinen Nächsten gleich als mich.

Dies ist mein Dank, dies ist Sein Wille;
Ich soll vollkommen sein wie Er.
So lang ich dies Gebot erfülle,

Lebt Seine Lieb in meiner Seele,
So treibt sie mich zu jeder Pflicht;
Und ob ich schon aus Schwachheit fehle,
Herrscht doch in mir die Sünde nicht.

and settled long ago.

CHORUS
Long ago, long ago,
Yes the old account 
was settled long ago,
And the records clear today,
For He washed my sins away,
When the old account
was settled long ago.

The old account was large, 
and larger ev'ry day,
For I was always sinning, 
and never tried to pay.
But when I looked ahead, 
and saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle, 
and settled long ago.

When at the judgment bar, 
I stand before my King,
And He the Book will open, 
and can not find a thing.
Then will my heart be glad, 
while tears of joy will flow,
Because I had it settled, 
and settled long ago.

When in that happy home, 
my Saviour's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story,
and praise Him for His love.
I'll not forget that book, 
with pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled, 
and settled long ago.

O sinner seek the Lord, 
repent of all your sin,
For thus He has commanded, 
if you would enter in.
And then if you should live, 
a hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it, 
you settled long ago."

Ach, nur ein sünd'ges Herze ist mein. 
Jesus, mein König, o wasche mich rein! 
Jesus, mein König, o wasche mich rein!

Näher, noch näher! 
Ganz in den Tod gebe ich willig, 
mein Heiland und Gott, 
was Deinen Segen hemmte in mir: 
Weltliche Freuden und irdische Zier, 
weltliche Freuden und irdische Zier.

Näher, noch näher, 
völl'ger und frei, 
bis alles eigene Ringen vorbei, 
bis all mein Leben 
Dein Abglanz ist und Du, 
HErr Jesus, mein alles mir bist, 
und Du, HErr Jesus, mein alles mir bist!"
1570;Nichts, nichts kannst du tun;G;"Nichts, nichts kannst du tun 
zur Erlösung, sie ist ja vollbracht, 
sie ist dein; du sollst sie nur nehmen 
und glauben, um ewig errettet zu sein! 
Nichts, nichts kannst du tun 
zur Vergebung; denn Gnade, 
die wird nicht verdient; 
Gerechtigkeit ist dir erworben von dem, 
der die Sünde gesühnt.

Nichts, nichts kannst du tun 
fürs schneeweiße, 
im Blute gewaschene Kleid; 
nur lass dich im Glauben drein kleiden, 
so ziert dich vor Gott Heiligkeit. 
Nichts, nichts kannst du tun 
für die Wohnung, 
die Gott uns in Salem erbaut; 
nur komm, weil ja alles bereitet, 
so rufen der Geist und die Braut.

Nichts, nichts kannst du tun 
für den Himmel, 
das selige Herrlichkeitsreich. 
Ererbt es; denn Ich und der Vater, 
spricht Jesus, Wir schenken es Euch! 
Nichts, nichts kannst du tun 
zu der Würde, zu tragen die goldene Kron', 
leg die dir aus Gnaden geschenkte 
nur demütig nieder am Thron!"
1573;O, Du Lamm Gottes;A;"O, Du Lamm Gottes, 
Du hast auf Golgatha 
herrlich gesieget. Amen, Halleluja! 
Du hast erworben Heil 
für die ganze Welt 
und hast auf's Völligste gezahlt 
das Lösegeld. 
Du riefst mit lauter Stimm' 
durch's Todes Nacht: 
Es ist vollbracht! Es ist vollbracht!

O, Wort des Lebens, 
hier kann mein Glaube ruh'n; 
auf diesen Felsen kann ich 
mich gründen nun. 
Ewig vollkommen ist unsres Gottes Heil. 
Nimm es, o Sünder, an, 
so wird dir's ganz zuteil! 
Nichts kannst du machen mehr, 
Er hat's gemacht: Es ist vollbracht! 
Es ist vollbracht!

O, Wort des Sieges! 
Wenn mir der Satan naht, 
blick' ich zum Helden, 
der ihn zertreten hat. 
In Jesu Wunden bin ich erlöst und frei; 
Sein lauter Todesruf 
ist nun mein Siegesschrei. 
Nicht soll mich fesseln 
mehr des Feindes Macht: 
Es ist vollbracht! Es ist vollbracht!

Jesus, mein Heiland, 
Dir sag' ich Preis und Dank! 
O Überwinder, hör meinen Lobgesang! 
In Deine Gnade hüll' ich mich tief hinein, 
in Deinem teuren Blut 
bin ich gerecht und rein. 
Ehr' sei dem Lamm, das rief, 
da es geschlacht't: Es ist vollbracht! 
Es ist vollbracht!"
1574;Von der Erde reiß mich los;G;"O mein Jesus, Du bist's wert, 
dass man Dich im Staube ehrt, 
dass man Dich beständig lobt und ehrt! 
Niemand ist so gut wie Du, 
meine Seele jauchzt Dir zu, 
meine Seele jauchzt Dir fröhlich zu!

CHORUS
Von der Erde reiß mich los,
mache meinen Glauben groß;
gib mir einen treuen Sinn,
nimm mich ganz, mein Jesus hin!

Deine Hand hat mich gemacht, 
wunderbar ans Licht gebracht, 
wunderbar ans helle Licht gebracht. 
Und Dein Blut hat mich erlöst, 
dass ich ewig sei getröst't, 
dass ich nun auf ewig sei getröst't.

Huldreich blickest Du mich an, 
sagst mir, dass ich kommen kann, 
sagst mir, dass ich zu Dir kommen kann 
und dass Du der Sünden Schuld 
nicht gedenkst nach Deiner Huld, 
nicht gedenkst 
nach Deiner Gnad' und Huld."
1575;O, sel'ge Stunden im Gebet;D;"O, sel'ge Stunden im Gebet, 
wo alle Not der Welt vergeht, 
da knie ich an des Vaters Thron, 
Er kennt von fern 
mein Wünschen schon. 
In tiefem Gram, in Trübsalszeit 
hat für Sein Kind Er Hilf' bereit. 
Er des Versuchers Plan zerschlägt, 
wenn ich verharre im Gebet.

O, sel'ge Stunden im Gebet, 
wo Wonne uns und Glück umweht, 
wo unser Geist 
von Sehnsucht brennt 
und das Verlangen nach Ihm kennt. 
O, lasst uns eilen in Sein Licht, 
wo Er uns zeigt Sein Angesicht, 
und warten fröhlich früh und spät 
und Seiner harren im Gebet.

O, sel'ge Stunden im Gebet! 
Es dringt zu Ihm, was wir gefleht. 
Des Heilands Güt' und Freundlickeit 
den Wartenden Sein Heil verleiht. 
Weil Er mich heißt, auf Ihn zu schau'n, 
der Gnade und dem Wort zu trau'n, 
werf' ich auf Ihn, was mich bewegt 
und harre Seiner im Gebet."
1577;Lass mich geh'n;G;"CHORUS
Lass mich geh'n mit Dir, Jesus,
lass niemals mehr mich allein.
Denn ohne Dich kann ich nie mehr
den Himmel einst nennen mein Heim.

Ich fand Dich, als ich so betrübt war.
Ich fand Dich, als ich war allein.
Du halfst mir, als niemand mehr konnte
und wusste nicht aus oder ein.

Ich war auf dem Berge mit Jesus,
ich war in dem Tale, so tief.
Und niemals hat Er mich verlassen,
drum bring' ich die Sorgen zu Ihm."
1579;Wir leben in dem Kommen;C;"Wir leben in dem Kommen des HErrn. 
Siehe, der Bräutigam! Ja, es ist wahr, 
Sein Kommen begann! 
Ist Er nicht wunderbar?

CHORUS
O, diese Jubelzeit, wir ziehen himmelan.
Was auch kommt, wie es sei,
uns zieht der Schlußstein an.

Es ist jetzt die Vereinigungszeit 
durch das lebend'ge Wort.
Die Liebe Gottes uns vereint 
in diesem Himmelsort.

Es kann ja jeden Tag gescheh'n, 
Er holt zu sich die Braut.
O, willst auch du mit heimwärts geh'n, 
warte auf Ihn, das Haupt!"
1583;Selig ist's dem HErrn zu trauen;G;"Selig ist's, dem HErrn zu trauen

und zu wissen: So spricht Gott!

CHORUS
Jesus, Jesus, Dir vertrau' ich,
Du erfüllest mein Begehr';
Jesus, Jesus, teurer Jesus,
Dir vertrauen möcht' ich mehr.

O, wie köstlich, Dir zu trauen, 
Deinem reinigenden Blut, 
gläubig mich hineinzutauchen 
in die heiligende Flut.

Es ist gut, dem HErrn zu trauen, 
der von Sünd' und Ich befreit, 
und von Ihm dann täglich nehmen 
Kraft und Gnade, Fried' und Freud'.

Ich bin froh, ich darf vertrauen, 
treuer Jesus, einzig Dir, 
und ich weiß, Du willst mich leiten 
bis zum Ziel; Du bleibst bei mir."
1585;Since Jesus has set me free;D;"CHORUS

now I shout the victory,
for Jesus has set me free."
1586;Mach, was klein Dir;A;"Sieh, hier bin ich, mein König, 
ich weihe mich Dir; nimm gebrauche mich, 
HErr, wie Du willst. Ach, ich weiß, 
nichts, was Wert hat, ist irgend an mir, 
nichts, wenn Du mich nicht selber erfüllst.

CHORUS
Mach, was klein Dir, mir klein,
was Dir groß ist, mir groß,
dass ich folge Dir, Jesus, allein.
Mach vom eigenen Sinn, 
von mir selber mich los,
lass ein brauchbares Werkzeug mich sein!

Sieh, hier bin ich, mein König, 
mein Herze, das brennt, 
Dir zu dienen, wo Du es begehrst. 
Gib, dass völlig Dein Geist 
vom Verlangen mich trennt, 
mir zu nehmen, was Du nicht gewährst.

Sieh, hier bin ich, mein König, 
und ist meine Hand, 
nicht geschickt für den vordersten Streit, 
so verzäune die Lücken 
und bess're das Land, doch durch mich, 
denn ich bin Dir geweiht.

Sieh, hier bin ich, mein König, 
ob niemand es weiß, 
wenn Dein Auge nur über mir wacht! 
Wenn ich da, wo ich steh', 
tu' nach Deinem Geheiß, 
bin ich glücklich bei Tag und bei Nacht."
1587;So lieb und freundlich;G;"So lieb und freundlich Jesus kam, 
sich meiner Seel' so warm annahm, 
hob mich aus tiefer Sünd' 
und Schand' mit Seiner Gnadenhand.

CHORUS
Sinkendem Sand entriss Er mich!
Mit zarter Hand hob mich zu sich!
Empor aus Nacht zu vollem Licht!
Gott sei gelobt, zu vollem Licht!

Er rief mich lang, 
eh' ich's gehört und eh's 
mein sünd'ges Herz begehrt'. 
Und als ich Ihn beim Worte nahm, 
Vergebung ich bekam.

Die Dornenkron' Sein Haupt umwand, 
der Nagel drang durch Seine Hand, 
als meine Schuld und Straf' Er trug, 
in  Liebe nach mir frug.

Auf höherm Grund, jetzt gnadenvoll, 
wohnt meine Seel', sie weiß es wohl. 
Warum und wie, weiß, wer Ihn fand, 
kennt Seine Retterhand."
1588;Meine Hände waren voll von Dingen;D;"Meine Hände waren voll von Dingen, 
die mit Stolz ich einstmals nannte mein. 
Edlen Steinen gleich in gold'nen Ringen, 
strahlten sie mir zauberhaft und fein. 
Aber Jesus nahm mir meine Hände, 
ließ sie stille in den Seinen ruh'n; 
machte so der eitlen Lust ein Ende, 
alles fiel zu Seinen Füßen hin.

Meine Hände waren alle Tage 
immer unrein und mit Schuld befleckt. 
Ach, umsonst war alle meine Plage, 
meine Sünde war noch nicht bedeckt. 
Aber Jesus nahm mir meine Hände, 
ließ die meinen in den Seinen ruh'n; 
machte so der Unruh' bald ein Ende, 
durch Sein Blut war ich gereinigt nun.

Ungehorsam waren meine Hände, 
nur dem eig'nen Willen untertan. 
Gleich, als ob man so sein Leben fände, 
o, wie rang ich da in stillem Wahn! 
Aber Jesus nahm mir meine Hände, 
ließ die Seinen auf den meinen ruh'n; 
machte so der Unruh' bald ein Ende. 
O, wie süß ist der Gehorsam nun."

Niemals mehr alt, niemals mehr alt.
In diesem Land werden wir nie mehr alt.
Niemals mehr alt, niemals mehr alt.
In diesem Land werden wir nie mehr alt.

In dem herrlichen Heim sind 
wir nie mehr allein; es wird dort 
in der Herrlichkeit sein. 
Den König preisen wir dort, 
der uns gab hier Sein Wort. 
In dem Land, wo der Tod ist ganz fort.

Wenn die Arbeit vollbracht, 
wird die Kron' mir gebracht. 
Alle Prüfungen sind dann vorbei. 
Alle Sorgen sind fort 
und wir stimmen froh ein; 
mit den Lieben, die jetzt schon sind dort."

Gläubig steh' ich auf dem Worte
meines Heilands Jesus Christus.
Gläubig steh' ich auf dem Worte

Fest trau' ich dem Wort des HErrn,

Doch durchs Wort des HErrn 
wird mir der Sieg so leicht, 
drum trau' ich dem Worte meines HErrn.

Steh' ich auf dem Worte,

Fest trau' ich dem Worte meines HErrn."

machte mich frei und rein,
war es ein Wunder

Obwohl wir Ihn

But when He saved my soul,
cleansed and made me whole,
it took a miracle 
of love and grace.

Though here His glory has been shown; 
we can't fully see,

Doch bis dahin, 
mein Herz wird weiter singen, 
bis dahin, mit Freude gehe ich.
Bis zu dem Tag, 
wenn ich die Stadt erblicke,

Die Dinge hier verblassen 
und sind wertlos; wir wissen ja, 
wir nehmen sie nicht mit. 
Die Sorgen hier, 
die uns so sehr bedrücken, 
sind dann vorbei, 
wenn wir einst bei Ihm sind.

Er bahnt dir einen Weg, 
führet sicher dich ans Ziel; 
wirf die Sorgen auf den HErrn

Wenn die Jugend von dir geht 
und das Alter naht heran 
und du gehst gebeugt durch 
manche schwere Last;

lässt dich sicher nicht allein; 
wirf die Sorgen auf den HErrn

The city of God, built by Jesus four
square;
Than John saw, from Mt. Zion the Bride; 
The descending Word,

Every step, every footprint you make;
It's a victory, every demon will shake."

How could He recognize me
I wasn't the same
I knew I should pay
And I know the price
For justice and law
Demanded my life
But His tender heart
Heard my desperate cry
Ande He saw my past
Through merciful eyes

CHORUS
Beautiful
That's how mercy saw me
For I was broken ans so lost
Mercy looked at all my faults.
The justice of God saw
What I had done
But mercy saw me
Through the Son
Not what I was
But what I could be
That's how mercy saw me

Whatever you've done
You can't go too far
That His eyes of mercy
Can't see where you are
He loves you too much
To leave you alone
Your flesh of His flesh
And bone of His bone
And His heart cries out
For your heart today
See yourself through His eyes
Then you will say"

CHORUS
Denn was auch immer nötig ist, um Dir näher zu kommen, 
HErr, das bin ich bereit zu tun. 
Was es auch benötigt, Dir ähnlicher zu werden, 
Das bin ich bereit zu tun.

Nimm die Dinge, die mir am liebsten sind,
wenn das nötig ist, um mich Dir näher zu bringen.
Lass Enttäuschungen kommen, einsame Tage
ohne Sonnenschein, wenn ich durch Leiden Dir
ähnlicher werden kann.

Nimm meine  Häuser, mein Land, 
ändere meine Träume und meine Pläne, 
denn ich lege mein ganzes Leben in Deine Hände. 
Und wenn Du mich heute zu einem weit entfernten
Land rufst, HErr, dann werde ich Deinem Willen gehorchen.

Was auch immer es erfordern wird

Er höret gern ein Lied
zu Seiner Ehre.
Lobt froh den Herrn,
lobt froh den Herrn!

Es schallt empor
zu Deinem Heiligtume
Aus unserm Chor
ein Lied zu Deinem Ruhme,
Du, der sich Kinder auserkor.

Vom Preise voll,
laß unser Herz Dir singen!
Das Loblied soll
zu Deinem Throne dringen,
das Lob,
das unsrer Seel entquoll.

Wir stammeln hier,
doch hörst Du unser Lallen
Und lässt es Dir
in Gnaden wohl gefallen.
Dir jauchzen wir, Dir singen wir.

O Seligkeit! Dich, unsern Vater,

Blicke ich zu Deinem Kreuz empor;
Sehe Deiner heilgen Augen Grüßen,
seh das Blut aus Deinen Wunden fließen,
und mein Dank quillt brennend heiß hervor.

Ja, für mich gabst Du Dein teures Leben, 
trugst die Strafe, Herr, für meine Schuld.
Ach, was konnte ich zum Lohn Dir geben?
Hatte gar nichts als mein sündges Leben, 
das Du sahst mit Schmerzen und Geduld.

Und Du sprachst:""O gib mir deine Sünde,
du bist mein, ich hab erlöst auch dich!
Und ich kam und durfte Frieden finden,
darf nun glaubend durch Dich überwinden,
wo so lang der Feind gefesselt mich.

Doch Dein Segen war noch nicht zu Ende,
mehr noch für Dein Kind, Herr, hattest Du.
Zu Dir streckt ich meine Glaubenshände, 
dass ich auch in Dir, mein Heiland, 
fände neues Leben, selge Glaubensruh.

Und die Fülle sandtest Du hernieder, 
tauftest mich mit Feuer, Kraft und Geist;
neue Zungen, heilge neue Lieder 
klingen nun in meinem Herzen wider.
Jauchzend meine Seele Dich lobpreist.

Halleluja! 
Welche Segensfülle hast Du, Heiland
Noch für mich bereit!
In Dir ruht mein Leben und mein Wille,
in dem Herzen wohnet heilge Stille.
Halleluja Dir in Ewigkeit!"

Der Sohn erscheint

Als Kindlein liegt im Stalle

Chorus
Liebe, sei gelobt in alle Ewigkeit, 
o, Liebe, sei gelobt in alle Ewigkeit.

Um unsern Fluch zu tragen,
lässt Er ans Kreuz sich schlagen
Den Übeltätern gleich,
der Schmach, dem Tod geweiht.
Er stirbt , um uns zu retten
und lässt ins Grab sich betten.

Der Herr erwacht; Er lebet!
Die Erde freudig bebet;
Dem Grab entsteigt der Held
als Sieger in dem Streit.
Er lebt, um uns zu geben
Sein Auferstehungsleben.

Der Herr ist nun erhoben
zur Rechten Gottes droben
Und bittet dort für uns
den Vater allezeit.
Ihm ist an uns gelegen,
Er will uns nähren, pflegen.

Er will, dass wir auf Erden schon
eines mit Ihm werden,
und machet unser Herz
zur Wohnung sich bereit.
Da will Er wirken, walten,
von Sünden rein uns halten.

Bald wird der Herr erscheinen
und uns um Ihn vereinen;
Dann herrschen wir mit Ihm
in seiner Herrlichkeit.
Mit Thronen und mit Kronen
wird Er die Seinen lohnen."

macht Seine Steige richtig,
lasst alles, was er hasst;
macht alle Bahnen recht,

macht niedrig, was hoch stehet,
was krumm ist, gleich und schlecht.

Ein  Herz, das Demut liebet,
bei Gott am höchsten steht;
ein Herz, das Hochmut übet, 
mit Angst zugrunde geht;
ein Herz, das richtig ist 
und folget Gottes Leiten,
das  kann sich recht bereiten,
zu dem kommt Jesus Christ.

Ach, mache Du mich Armen

O aller Welt Verlangen, 
o meiner Seele Zier!
O Jesus, Jesus zünde 
selbst die Fackel an,
auf dass mein Herz ergründe,

Dein Zion streut Dir Psalmen 
und grüne Zweige hin,
und ich will Dir in Psalmen 
ermuntern meinen Sinn.
Mein Herze soll dir grünen 
in stetem Lob und Preis
Und Deinem Namen dienen, 
so gut es kann und weiß.

Ich lag in schweren Banden; 
Du kommst und machst mich los.
Ich stand in Spott und Schanden;
Du kommst und machst mich groß!
Und hebst mich hoch zu Ehren
Und schenkst mir großes Gut,
das sich nicht lässt verzehren,
wie irdscher Reichtum tut.

Nichts, nichts hat Dich getrieben
Zu mir vom Himmelszelt
Als Dein getreues Lieben,
Damit Du alle Welt
In ihren tausend Plagen
Und großen Jammerslast,
die kein Mund kann aussagen, 
so fest umfangen hast.

Nein, Jesus will sie decken

Er kommt aus Seines Vaters Schoß
Und wird ein Kindlein klein;
Liegt dort elend, nackt und bloß
In einem Krippelein.
Einem Krippelein,
in einem Krippelein.

Er äußert Sich all Seiner G'walt, 
wird niedrig und gering
und nimmt an Sich
eines Knechts Gestalt,
der Schöpfer aller Ding.
Schöpfer aller Ding,
der Schöpfer aller Ding.

Er wechselt mit uns wunderlich,
Fleisch und Blut nimmt Er an
Und gibt uns in Sein Vatersreich 
die klare Gottheit dran.
Klare Gottheit dran,
die klare Gottheit dran.

Er wird ein Knecht und ich ein Herr,
das mag ein Wechsel sein.
Wie könnt es doch sein freundlicher, 
das Herze Jesulein.
Herze Jesulein,

so dass sich meine Augen feuchten,
weil mir das Herz vor Wonne lacht.
Im Finstern hatte ich gesessen,
da konnte mir der Heiland nahn;
und ich kann nimmermehr vergessen,
was Jesus hat an mir getan.

Im Weihnachtsglanze sah ich strahlen
Voll Herrlichkeit das Jesuskind, 
wie es nicht irdsche Farben malen,
so liebend zart, so göttlich lind.
Ich darf von seinem Manna essen
Schon hier auf meiner Pilgerbahn.
Da kann ich nimmermehr vergessen,
was Jesus hat an mir getan.

Ich war in Sündennot verloren
Und wusste nicht mehr aus noch ein,
da ward in mir das Kind geboren,
durch das wir können selig sein.
O welche Gnade unermessen.
Ich durfte Seinen Geist empfahn.
Nun kann ich nimmermehr vergessen,
was Jesus hat an mir getan.

Hast du noch nicht dies Heil erkoren, 
o Herz, dann nimm es heute an!
Für dich auch ist der Herr geboren,
der dich so selig machen kann.
Lass hinter dir die Welt, statt dessen
Tritt an die Krippe froh heran!
Dann wirst du nimmermehr vergessen,
was Er für dich, für dich getan.

Ja, dir erklingen Weihnachtslieder 
Und rufen dich zu Gott zurück.
Der Himmel öffnet dir sich wieder
Und bietet dir das wahre Glück.

O wenn die Glocken erklingen,
schnell sie das Christkindlein hört,
muß sich vom Himmel dann schwingen,
eilet hernieder zur Erd,
segnet den Vater, die Mutter, das Kind.
Glocken, mit heiligem Klang 
Klingt doch die Erde entlang!

wenn ich nur in Jesu bin!

Jesus trug mit treuem Herzen
Unsre Schuld und war ein Fluch.
Er nahm auf sich unsre Schmerzen,
als man Ihn ans Fluchholz schlug.

Kann wohl Liebe dich erweichen?
Kannst du Treue noch verstehn?
O dann müsst das Kreuzeszeichen
Auch durch deine Seele gehn.

1723;Nichts Kannst Du Tun;;"Nichts, nichts kannst du tun
zur Erlösung,

du sollst sie nur glauben und nehmen,
um ewig errettet zu sein.
Nichts, nichts kannst du tun

denn Gnade, die wird nicht verdient;
Gerechtigkeit ist dir erworben, 
von dem, der die Sünde gesühnt.

Nichts, nichts kannst du tun 
fürs schneeweiße,
im Blute gewaschenen Kleid;
nur lass dich im Glauben drein kleiden,
so ziert dich vor Gott Heiligkeit.
Nichts, nichts kannst du tun
für die Wohnung,
die Gott uns in Salem erbaut;
nur komm weil ja alles bereitet, 
so rufet der Geist und die Braut.

Nichts, nichts kannst du tun
für den Himmel,
das selige Herrlichkeitsreich.
Ererbt es, denn Ich und der Vater, 
spricht Jesus, wir schenken es euch!

1724;Nur Ein Ungewisses Hoffen;;"Nur ein ungewisses Hoffen
ist der Glaube dieser Welt;
Jedem Zweifel steht es offen,
wenn das Herz auch stark sich stellt.
Der Glaube des Christen
kann nimmer verzagen,
Mit seinem Erlöser kann alles er wagen;
Er hofft aufs Gewisseste, was er nicht sieht;
Das Bangen verstummt,
und der Zweifel entflieht.

Glaube ist kein zagend Schweben;
nicht ein fragend: ""Kann wohl sein!""
Solcher Glaube hat kein Leben, 
ist nicht Wahrheit, sondern Schein.
Der Glaube steht fest wie ein Felsen im Meere
Und trotzet der Zweifel 
aufsteigendem Heere;
Mag Himmel und Erde und alles vergehn,
So sehn wir die Fahne des Glaubens 
noch wehn.

In dem Wust des Erdentandes
blähet die Vernunft sich auf;
In den Fesseln des Verstande
geht des Wissens matter Lauf.
Der Glaube zersprengt
die irdischen Ketten,
Und weiß vom Gewirr der Vernunft
sich zu retten, Er strebet zum Himmel, 
ein kräftiger Baum, und lässt dem Verstande
die Zeit und den Raum.

Tot und kraftlos ist der Glaube,
wird er nicht vom Geist entflammt;
Liegt gefesselt in dem Staube,
wenn er von der Erde stammt.
Mein Jesus, o sende den Geist mir hernieder,
Und stärke die oft so ermatteten Glieder!
Fortan sei der Glaube der siegende Held,
Erlegend die Selbstsucht,

O Jesus, mein Heiland,
wie bist Du so treu! 
Du hast mir die Freiheit verschafft. 
Es schützt mich
und trägt Deine helfende Hand 
und füllt mir die Seele mit Kraft.

Mit Freudenöl
hast Du das Haupt mir gesalbt

in meine Sündennacht eindrang
der helle Sonnenstrahl, 
bin ich für Gott erwacht.
Seitdem ich weiß, wer mich geliebt

Noch eh ich Ihn gefunden,
hat sich Sein Herz in Liebe

Das Band, das Er geschlungen hat,
löst keine Macht der Zeiten; 
denn ich bin Sein und Er ist mein
in alle Ewigkeiten.

Mir ward ein Freund;
o welch ein Freund!
Er starb, um mich zu retten,
und dann schenkt Er das Leben mir,
um mich an Seins zu ketten.
Ich habe nichts, was Er nicht gab,
mein Herz, mein ganzes Leben
und alles, was ich bin und hab, 
Ihm ist es übergeben.

Mir ward ein Freund;
o welch ein Freund!
Sein ist die Macht auf Erden.
Durch Ihn wird ich beschirmt,
bewahrt in Trübsal und Beschwerden.
Der Glanz der ewgen Herrlichkeit
strahlt mir mit hellem Schimmer; 
jetzt gilt es wachen, wirken noch,
dann heißt es: Ruh für immer!

Mir ward ein Freund;
o welch ein Freund!
Ein freundlicher, mitleidger,

Triumphierend brach das Lamm

Durch das Blut am Kreuzesstamm

Überwunden durch das Blut

Jesus machte alles gut,
blickt auf uns mit Huld.

Überwunden durch das Blut

Trotz des Teufels List und Wut
wird uns Sieg gebracht.

Überwunden durch das Blut

Da weiß ich doch von keiner Pein,

Wie immer mich die Welt umtobt,

an dem ich mich erlabe.

Ich weiß von keinem Herzeleid,
ist Jesus mir zur Rechten.
Er geht voran und führt den Streit
und wird den Sieg erfechten.
Ich weiß, dass ich gewinnen soll,
wenn ich mich nur vertrauensvoll
Dem Heiland übergebe,

Ziehn auch Gewitter um mich her,

Bedroht mich Sturm und wildes Meer,
so kann ich aufwärts schauen.
Es ist genug, wenn der mich hält,
der überwunden hat die Welt.
Mein Jesus bleibt doch Sieger,

O sagt mir nichts von Traurigkeit,

Er nahm die schwere Last von mir,
sprach: ""Meinen Frieden geb ich dir""

O selges, Ja, das ich ihm gab,
und das Er mir ins Herze schrieb.
Gottlob, dass ich dies Zeugnis hab,
der Kindschaft zarten Geistestrieb!

Es ist geschehn!
Er ist getan, der Schritt,
der niemals noch gereut.
Gott nahm auch mich
aus Gnaden an, nun folg ich gern,
wie Er gebeut.

Mein lang geteiltes, armes Herz,
so geh zu deiner Ruhe ein!

mein Gott, ein neues Lied,
weil sie mit großer Treue
mich aus dem Verderben zieht.
In mir ist weder Hilf noch Rat;
zu groß ist meine Schuld.
Doch Du nimmst weg die Missetat
und hast mit mir Geduld.

Nur Deine Liebe ist mein Heil,
sie ist mein lieblich Los.
Ich hatt am Himmel keinen Teil,
war elend, nackt und bloß.
In öder Wüste lag ich lahm,
in Sünden krank und wund.
Mein Samariter aber kam
und machte mich gesund.

Nur Deine Liebe ist mein Hort,
wenn ich verzagen will.
Sie spricht zu mir ein freundlich Wort,
macht meine Seele still.
Dann schweigt in mir der Klagelaut,
verschwunden ist der Schmerz,
weil nun getrost mein Auge schaut,
o Jesus, in Dein Herz.

Nur Deine Liebe ist mein Trost,
wenn ich beklagen muss,
dass, wenn Versuchung mich umtost,
oft strauchelt noch mein Fuß.
Dann steht vor mir Dein Marterbild,
ich seh Dich betend knien;
Da greif ich nach dem Glaubensschild,
der Sünde zu entfliehn.

Nur Deine Liebe ist mein Sieg;
nichts bin ich ohne Dich.
Du bist mein Streiter in dem Krieg;
Du nur beschirmest mich.
Hilf, dass mein Glaube stets gewinnt,
dass ich der Sünd sterb ab,
und halte mich Dir treu gesinnt,
mein Heiland, bis zum Grab.

Nur Deiner Liebe rühmt mein Mund,
sie preis ich jedem an,
Dass doch auf Erden werde kund,
was Du für uns getan.

gieß Deine Kraft hinein,
Dass es auch andre Herzen zieht,

Ist, o Lamm Gottes,
Dein Kreuz und Tod!
Denn Du trugst die Sünden
der ganzen Erde,
Dass ich und alle Welt
selig werde
Durch Dein Verdienst.

So weit hat's Liebe
zu mir gebracht,
die selbst den Schöpfer
zum Opfer macht,
dass er Seine Seele,
Sein Leib und Leben
mit tausend Schmerzen
dahingegeben für meine Schuld.

Kein Mensch beschreibt es
nach Würdigkeit!
Das aber ist eine selge Zeit,
wenn Dein Strom der Liebe
sich so ergießet,
dass mein Herz im Geist genießet,
o Freudenmeer!

Ich will von nun an
nichts andres sehn,
als nur, was für mich
am Kreuz geschehn.
Das ist meine Freude,
mein Heil und Leben,
Denn meine Sünden
sind mir vergeben
Durch Christi Blut!

O Blut des Bundes,
mach heilig mich!
O Lebenswasser, ich trinke dich!
Ja, himmlisches Brot,
dich muss ich stets essen!
Gestillt, gesättigt,
darf ich vergessen,
was mich noch drückt.

Verkündigt werde ich
bitt'rer Tod!
Rühmen will ich Deine Leidensnot,
bis Du selbst erscheinest;
nichts will ich wissen,
als dass Dein Tod
mich herausgerissen
aus aller Furcht."
1748;O Welche Lieb;;"Gott gab als Lösegeld,
o welche Lieb!
Für die verlorne Welt,
o welche Lieb!
Seinen geliebten Sohn,
Jesus, vom Himmelsthron
Für den verlornen Sohn,
o welche Lieb!

Er hat mich freigemacht,
o welche Lieb!
Er hat mir Licht gebracht,
o welche Lieb!
Als dort am Kreuzesstamm Jesus,
das Gotteslamm,
mein Elend auf sich nahm,
o welche Lieb!

Dir nur sei Lob und Ehr,
o welche Lieb!
Jesus, mein Gott und Herr,
o welche Lieb!
Mein ganzes Leben lang
schalle mein Lobgesang
Stets Dir mit Jubelklang:
"" O welche Lieb!"""
1749;Weicht, Ihr Finstern Sorgen;;"Weicht, ihr finstern Sorgen!
Denn auf heut und morgen
Sorgt ein andrer Mann.
Lasst mich nun mit Frieden!
Ich hab's dem beschieden,
der es besser kann.
Schreit die Welt gleicht immer: ""Geld""
Ich will ""Hosianna"" schreien,
Glauben und mich freuen.

Der die Haare zählet,
dem kein Sperling fehlet,
der die Raben speist,
der hat mich geschaffen,
der bedarf kein Schlafen,
der ist nicht verreist.
Der den Sohn so lange schon
Für mein Heil dahingegeben,
der ist noch am Leben.

Mir den Erben schenken
Und sich noch bedenken,
Wenn's am Brote fehlt,
das ist ohne Zweifel
ein Gedicht vom Teufel,
der die Herzen quält.
Bösewicht, begreifst du's nicht?
Der Sein Kind nicht abgeschlagen,
was wird der versagen?

Wenn ich Ihn erkenne,
meinen Herrn Ihn nenne,
wie sein Geist mich lehrt,
so bin ich, der Sünder,
in der Zahl der Kinder,
die er bitten hört.
Mein Gebet wird nicht verschmäht,
und nach überstandnen Proben
werd ich fröhlich loben.

Nun, so weicht, ihr Sorgen!
Denn auf heut und morgen
Sorgt ein andrer Mann.
Ich will ruhig bleiben,
meine Arbeit treiben,
wie ich immer kann.
Christi Blut stärkt meinen Mut
Und lässt mich in Not und Plagen
Nimmermehr verzagen."
1750;Wie Schafe Fröhlich Werden;;"Wie Schafe fröhlich weiden,

Wenn ich's oft nicht verstehe,
weil ich zu blöde bin,
dann gib, Herr, aus der Höhe
Dein Licht in meinen Sinn!
Dann gib, Herr, aus der Höhe,
Dein Licht in meinen Sinn!

Wie jener auf dem Wagen
vom Lamme Gottes las,
so lass mich lesend fragen:
""Glaub und versteh ich das?""
Wie dort einst auf dem Wege
der Jünger Herz entbrannt,
so mach auch mein Herz rege
durch himmlischen Verstand.
So mach auch mein Herz rege
durch himmlischen Verstand.

Lass Deines Wortes Kräfte
mich immer mehr erfreun;
Lass es mein Haupt geschäfte
zu allen Zeiten sein!
Stets will ich's wiederholen,
so wird mir täglich süß,
sowohl was Gott befohlen,
als was Er mir verhieß,
sowohl was Gott befohlen,
als was Er mir verhieß."
1751;Unter Deinem Kreuz;;"Unter Deinem Kreuz, Herr Jesus,
Find ich Ruh zu jeder Stund!
Wo ist Friede sonst auf Erden?
Du nur machst das Herz gesund.
Du verzeihst mir meine Fehle,
Machst das Dunkel in mir hell,
und es fließt in meine Seele
Wasser aus dem Lebensquell!

Unter Deinem Kreuz zu stehen,
Bleibe immer mein Freud.
Nach Dir kann ich gläubig sehen,
weil mich meiner Sünde reut.
Ohne Dich war ich verloren
Und ein Raub der ewgen Glut,
doch nun bin ich neugeboren
unterm Kreuze durch Dein Blut.

Unter Deinem Kreuze leben,
das ist wahres Lebensglück.
Drum muss ich mein Herz Dir geben,
dass es nimmer fällt zurück,
nun kann ich nur Dir gehören,
und die Sünde herrscht nicht mehr;
will mich Satan auch betören,
schau ich nur zum Kreuze her.

Unter Deinem Kreuz, Herr Jesus,
Hab ich Heil zu jeder Stund!
Da ist Friede, Gottes Friede,
Leib und Seele ist gesund.
Drum nun muss ich's allen sagen,
dass ein jeder komm herzu
und von Sünden, Schmerzen, Klagen
unter Deinem Kreuz ausruh."

Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

From darkest night, to rainbows end,
He's my forever friend.

Even when I turn away, He cares for me,
His love no one can shake.
Even as I walk away, He's by my side,
with every bred I take.
And sometimes I forget Him, my halo fails to shine,
and sometimes I'm not His friend,
but He's allways mine.

If you still don't know the one, I'm talking off.
I think it's time you do.

gikk frem mot løgn og vold,

Jeg vil elske det eldgamle kors,
ved dets kraft skal jeg seirende stå.
Jeg vil klynge meg inn til dets stam,

Selv om verden enn ler
av det eldgamle kors,
det på meg har slik dragende makt.
For Guds hellige Lam
det i lydighet bar,
da det tungt på Hans skulder ble lagt.

I det eldgamle kors
med Guds blod farvet rødt,
jeg en underfull skjønnhet nu ser.
For det var på det kors,
Han betalte min skyld,
så ei noe fordømmer meg mer.

For det eldgamle kors

I solens de brennende stråler,
der hist på den blodrøde hei.
Han henger og smertene tåler,

""Jeg tørster,"" å tenk hvilken smerte,

fristelsens bitreste kvaler,

Hun er brud, av Kongen den utvalgte,

""Min venninne, kom nu til meg ut.
Her er blomster mange, små og store,
det er vår, se vinteren er slutt.""

Turtelduens røst har latt seg høre,
fikentreets frukter rødmer til.
Liflig tale når til hennes øre,
Han sin fagre se så gjerne vil.

På sin brud Han finner intet lyte,
kjenner kun en duft av rene klær.
Hennes skikkelse Han ønsker nyte,
Kongens hjerte overvunnet er.

Mens i trengslens natt hun stille sover,
se da kommer Han til hennes dør.
Hennes søvn å bryte dog Han voger,
men Hans røst er like øm som før.

Fylt med lengsel, Han til henne roper:
""O, Lukk opp, min due, du er min!""
Se, Hans lokker full av duggens dråper;
Han sin hånd i luken rekker inn.

Du som sover, skynd deg, gjør deg rede!

1929;Se Herren et folk har utkåret;G;"Se, Herren et folk har utkåret,
og Israel utvalgt for seg.
I kjærlighet har Han dem båret,
Han kan dem ei miste - å nei.

I dødsskyggens land ble vi funnet,
blant villdyr med svelgende dyp.
Fra dødsflodens strender gjenvunnet,
Han dro opp det døende kryp.

Han leget de blødende vunder,
ja, fjernet hver angst og mén.
Og siden Han oss alle stunder,
bevarer som Sin øyensten.

Som ørnen, der vekker sitt rede,
på vingene bærer de små.
Han er hos oss alltid til stede,
Han aldri ifra oss vil gå.

Fra trelldom til friheten fører,
Han sine på slagfjær av sted.
Et hjemland Han for oss avslører,
og der nu vi hviler i fred.

Nu honning av klippen vi suger,
og oljen av stenen så hård.
Kun margfulle retter vi bruker,
for alt fra vår Jesus vi får."

jeg nu elsker som barnet sin mor.
Jesu Ord, Jesu Ord,
skal meg vekke, om jeg legges i jord.

Da bedrøvet jeg stod uten trøst,
gleden visnet som bladet om høst.
Da hvert håp som jeg før eide brast,
Jesu Ord gav meg håp som er fast.

Kor:
Jesu Ord, Jesu Ord,
er de samme i år som i fjor.
Jesu Ord, Jesu Ord,
er de samme i syd som i nord.

Kommer fienden, frykter jeg ei,
Jesu Ord står som vern på min vei.
Kommer lidelse, truende nød,
Jesu Ord trosser sykdom og død.

Jesus gjorde det alt,
da vår synd på sitt legem Han bar.
All vår sykdom Han tok,
våre fiender Han slo,

Vi nu ånder så fritt,
hvem kan måle hvor vidt,
mellom østen og vesten det er?
Og så langt er vår synd,
mange tusener pund,
båret bort av vår Frelser så kjær.

Ut i synden så kold,
ut av døderikets vold,
ut av djevelens trelldom så tung.
Han forløste min sjel,

Vi stoler på hva Han har sagt,

Herrens ledelse ved Ånden er den nok.
Fienden har sønderrevet,

og bryte bølgen blå,
Han skal og veien finne
hvorpå din fot kan gå.

På Herren du deg støtte
om det deg vel skal gå,
Hans gjerning må du nytte
om din skal kunne stå.
Av sorg og selvgjort plage
det kommer intet ut,
ti intet kan du tage
alt har du fått av Gud.

Din trofasthet og nåde,
O Fader, vet og ser,
hva skade eller både
kan vårt det skjøre ler.
Hva råd du velger gjøre,
det står som fjell så fast,
og det skal du utføre
om jord og himmel brast.

Vei har du alle steder,
på vike ingen trang,
velsignelser du spreder
og lys på all din gang.
Din akt ei nogen hind-rer
Din omhu blir ei trett,
før gledes-stråler tindrer
i øyne som har grett.

Og om alt Satans rike
vil stride Gud imot,
Han kan dog ikke vike,
Han står dog der Han stod.
Hva godt Han oss vil unne,
når vi kun giver tål,
det skjer i rette stunde
og når sitt endemål."

Min Frelser kjær, Ditt skjønne navn jeg nevner,
ifra mitt hjertes dyp jeg priser Deg.
Og alle tvilens mørke skyer revner,
Din nåde-sol skal gjennomstråle meg.

Jeg er jo skjult i Dine sår og vunder,
Ditt ord nu er blitt lykte for min fot.
Når Du meg fører inn i prøvens stunder,
Din Hellig Ånd skal gi meg kraft og mot.
La ilden alltid i mitt hjerte brenne,
fyll Du meg mere med Din kjærlighet.
Så jeg igjen kan andre sjeler tenne
i brann for Deg som skjenker liv og fred.

Jeg intet annet ønske har på ferden;
enn blott å være Deg et ærens kar.
At jeg må være lys og salt i verden,
og skinne som en stjerne ren og klar.
Du er mitt alt, O Jesus, Du er livet.
Hva enn meg møter, Du min lovsang er.
Du har jo Him'lens herlighet meg givet,

Og det var ei verd engang å nevnes,
mot et liv i Jesu fred og fryd.

Om jeg eide kjærlighet i verden,
og blant mennesker et æret navn.
Men ei noe håp for evigheten,
og for livets farkost ingen havn.
Om jeg eide alt, men ikke Jesus,
og Hans kjærlighet i korsets død.
Å, hvor hen i hele vide verden,
skulle jeg vel ty i hjertets nød?

Å hvor tomt er alt i denne verden,
uten Jesus er den blott en ørk.
Uten Jesus er og evigheten,
tom for glede, grufull, kold og mørk.
Om jeg kunne leve uten Jesus,
å, hvor ble det da å dø engang?
Uten Jesus i den mørke dalen,
uten Jesus evigheten lang?

Hvilken lykke å ha alt i Jesus,
legedom for alle hjertets sår.
Ingen synd som ikke Han forlater,
ingen nød som ikke Han forstår.
Om jeg eier Jesus, bare Jesus,

Sønnen har gjort meg virkelig fri!
Fri i fra nøden, dommen og døden.
Amen, Halleluja!

Lenge jeg tenkte Gud ikke skjenkte
nåde til den som fattedes alt.
Å måtte lide, kjempe og stride,
stod for mitt hjerte levende malt.
Men i min strid, min bedring og flid,
fantes det bare avmakt og død.
Lammet har vunnet, blodet har runnet,
Amen, Halleluja!

Å hvilken nåde midt i all våde:
Kristus har kjøpt oss just som vi er!
Han måtte lide, kjempe og stride,

chorus
Kor:
Til harpespill med palmegren i hånden,

Vel falt det tårer titt på brudens kinner,
når her på jord i prøvelser hun var.
Men som juveler disse tårer skinner.
Det var for Jesu skyld hun smerten bar.

Når sol å måne fra sin bane svimler,
og him'lens stjerner mot hverandre stimler.
La Kristi venner uforferdet står,
mens verdens barn av frykt og angst forgår.

Signal skal lyde klart i høye toner,
enhver skal skjønne hvem det er som troner.
Når jord og himmel settes skal i brann,
da går det galt med verdens store stand.

Jeg har et hjem, et rom i him'lens saler,
jeg reiser dit fra disse tåredaler.
Og hurtigtoget ruller nå av sted,
og snart jeg hjemme er i him'lens fred.

Billett jeg har til herlighetens rike,

Jeg har kun tur, for retur finnes ei,
nei, pris skje Gud, tilbake går jeg ei.

Visst er jeg ringe her i reisedrakten.

La verden se på det som synes smått,

Å tro det er å slippe

Å tro det er å bygge
sitt liv på Herrens Ord,
og søke fred og lykke,
kun der hvor Jesus bor,
og søke fred og lykke,
kun der hvor Jesus bor.

Å tro det er å hvile
på Hans fullbrakte verk,

Å tro det er å takke,
Guds vei er nådens vei,

Hver time trenger jeg Din sterke vakt,
kun for Din nåde viker mørkets makt.
Hvor skal jeg vandre trygt foruten Deg?
I mulm og solskinn, Herre, bli hos meg.

Når Du velsigner, ei av frykt jeg vet,

2071;Å at jeg kunne min Jesus prise;E;"Å at jeg kunne min Jesus prise,

Jeg gikk i blinde, jeg lå i døden,
og mørkets fyrste holdt meg ganske fast.
Og ropte jeg til min Gud i nøden,
Han frelste meg og mørkets lenker brast.

Ha takk, O Jesus, for korsets smerte,
for døden og for Dine mange sår.
Der fikk jeg fred for mitt arme hjerte,
og vinteren ble til en liflig vår.

Opp, alle vanner, og stem i sangen
til ære, pris for Ham som har oss løst.
Vi går i trengsel og strid så mange,
men kun en liten stund, å hvilken trøst.

Snart er vi hjemme og står for tronen,
hva gjør det da om solen har oss brent?
Når hytten faller, så får vi kronen,
og alt elende er så dermed endt.

Da skal vi skinne langt mer enn solen,
og mer enn stjernene med all sin glans.
Ja, med vår Jesus få plass på stolen,
men dette overgår dog all vår sans.

Å, tenk dog, brødre, hvor helgensangen,
vil bruse da som mange vanners lyd.
Og englers jubel vil øke klangen,
når de ser oss i sådan evig fryd.

Ja Deg alene skje evig ære,
O Jesus, som oss kjøpte med Ditt blod.
Vår syndebyrde Du måtte bære,
det skyldbrev slette ut oss var imot.

Å, hvilken lykke å Deg tilhøre,

Heaven came down

When at the cross the Savior

And my night was turned to day.

Into God's fam'ly divine:
Justified fully thru Calvary's love,
O what a standing in mine!
And the transaction so quickly was made,
When as a sinner I came,
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer
He saved me, O praise His dear name!

When at the cross I believed;
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received."

Never having to look back to what

You've just started your existence,
And where He's concerned there 
never was no sin;

For when God looks your way
He no longer sees a sinner
But a saint who's been washed white 
as snow;
Not by any thing we've done
But by the blood of God's own Son.
Are you washed by the water of the 
Word?

Are you washed by 
the water, 
Washed by the water

Se smertenes mann tok min synd og min skam,
i hjertet der høres en lovsang til ham.
For synden som tynget meg, hver dag hvert sekund,
bar han på korset, og jeg jubler hver stund.

Mitt liv er nå skjult i hans vunder og sår,
innfor Guds åsyn frimodig jeg står,
om verden omkring meg i uro forgår,
her på Golgata høyden så sikkert jeg står."

chorus
Go ask the man who's found a way,
through tangeled roads, back home to stay
when all communications were destroyed
Go ask the child who's walking now,
who once was crippled, then somehow,
her useless legs were made to jump for joy
Go ask the one whose burned out mind
has been restored, I think you'll find
The question's not important as before.
Don't ask me if He's good or bad,
I only know the guilt I had is gone
And I can't tell you anymore.

Don't ask me how to prove to you why 
I know God is there,
Or how I know that He would care for you.
Don't ask me why someone so great 
would chose to walk with me
And trade my broken life for one that's new.

chorus2
Go ask the child who's got a dad
To love away the hurt he had
Before this man called Jesus touched their lives
Go ask the one whose fears have fled
who's churring heart was quieted 
when someone whispered peace to all her strife
Go ask the man to tell you more
whose life was just a raging war inside himself
until the savior came.
I don't pretend to be so wise
I only know He touched my eyes
And nothing else will ever be same.

og mitt hjerte var så fullt
   av angst og nød.
Til Seg Selv og til Sitt Ord

Ofte jeg vandrer bedrøvet,

If that isn't love,

Even in death He remembered
the thief hanging by His side.
He spoke with love and compassion,
then He took Him to paradise."

Mange lever uten mening,
uten indre harmoni,
vandrer uten mål for livet,
alt er bare kamp og strid.
Gud har tent et lys for verden,
se det stråler nå mot deg;
kjære sjel, å kom til Jesus,
Han er lyset på din vei.

Tro på Gud kan alt forvandle,
bringe hjertet fred og ro.
Troen finner du ved korset

Her i de dype vunder

Herfra til jordens ender

Frykt i min barm ei finnes,
dypt i min frelste ånd,
frihetens innskrift funkler,
skrevet av Jesu hånd.

Ei jeg meg selv tilhører,

Kor:
Kom til Golgata du trette sjel!
Der har Jesus alle ting gjort vel.
Det var jo til Golgata

ved Hans blod du
   full forløsning har.

Du som ingen hvile har,

gå til Golgata, og se
   hva Jesus gjorde der!
Bøy deg ned ved korsets fot
   der synden ble betalt.
Åpne hjertet;

Du som tviler i din sjel,

720;A place called grace;;"So many years I heard it told
The story of compassion
A prodigal son who left the fold
And found no satisfaction
On my knees, Lord, I cried out to You
I’m so alone
But if there’s room in Your
house for one more
I’m ready to come back home?

I know there is a place
Where arms of compassion
Welcome me home
Sweet mercy falls like rain
I know there’s a place called grace

So many days I’ve dreamed of grace
Yet I have to wonder
How many times my human strength
Has kept me from surrender
The more I learn just to lean on the cross
The more I see
When I fall, I will fall to the place
Where mercy reaches me

If it seems that my courage is strong
There’s just one reason
He’s the Rock that my faith is built on
He holds me in His arms
Gives me strength to carry on"

In sweet captivity
Shall glory in His triumph
And share His victory

Though all the path before thee
The host of darkness fill,
Look to thy Father's promise,
And claim the vict'ry still.
Faith sees the heavenly legions,
Where doubt sees naught but foes,
And through the very conflict
Her life the stronger grows.

That from them God asks nothing
But to unlatch the door
Admitting Him who, through them,
Will conquer evermore."

That calls me from a world of care, 
And bids me, at my Father's throne, 
Make all my wants and wishes known; 
In seasons of distress and grief, 
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of  prayer, 
The joy I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return!
With such I hasten to the place 
Where God, my Saviour, shows His face,
And gladly take my station there, 
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer, 
Thy wings shall my petition bear 
To Him whose truth and faithfulness 
Engage the waiting soul to bless; 
And since He bids me seek His face, 
Believe His Word and trust His grace, 
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer, 
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
I view my home, and take my flight:
This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing thru the air,
Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"

And day by day,
They abide in the fold,
And go not astray;
They love Me because
I have made them My choice,
And they follow My call,
For My sheep know My voice.

My sheep know My voice,
And the pastures of green, 
Where I lead them so often to feed; 
My sheep know My voice,
And the cool sparkling stream,
Where beside its still waters I lead. 

My sheep know My voice,
And the valley of death, 
Thru which I shall
lead them some day; 
But no danger nor harm
Can touch one of them, 
For I will be with them always."

Pure, warm, and changeless be, 
A living fire!

I'm never alarmed at the overcast skies, 
The Master looks on at the strife.

I know that He safely will carry me through, 
No matter what evils betide,
Why should I then care, though the tempest may blow, 
If Jesus walks close to my side.

Our troubles will then all be o'er. 
The Master so gently will lead us away, 
Beyond that blest heavenly shore."

Never molested though in the wrong.

CHORUS
Farther along we'll know all about it.
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.

When death has come and taken our loved ones, 
It leaves our home so lonely and drear; 
Then do we wonder why others prosper, 
Living so wicked year after year.

Faithful till death said our loving 
Master, A few more days to labor and wait' 
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing, 
As we sweep through the beautiful gate.

When we see Jesus coming in glory,
When He comes from His home in the sky;

Let me never in darkness rove; 
Keep my path free from wrath, 
and my soul satisfied, 
Fill my way every day with love.

Soon the race will be o'er,

When all the saints of God 
are gathered home,

of the things that life demands, 
Want of food and want of shelter, 
thirsty hills and barren lands; 
But we're trusting in the Lord, 
and according to His Word, 
We will understand it better by and by.

Trials dark on every hand, 
and we cannot understand, 
All the ways that God would lead us 
to that blessed Promised Land; 
But He guides us with His eye 
and we'll follow till we die, 
For we'll understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares 
often take us unawares, 
And our hearts are made to bleed 
for many a thoughtless word or deed, 
And we wonder why the test 
when we try to do our best, 
But we'll understand it better by and by."
39;I Am Marked (OB 39);Ab;"I have lost my reputation

And a lot of friends went from me,

Now they pass me by unknown,
  when they once passed with a smile;
Now they say I'm very foolish, 
  and they say I'm out of style.

CHORUS
I am marked, marked, marked,
I am marked now wherever I go;
I am marked, marked, marked,
Just what I am everyone seems toknow.
I am sealed, sealed, sealed,
I am sealed by His Spirit Divine;
O glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen!
I am His, and I know He is mine.

Well, they say my life is ruined, 
  and my talent thrown away, 
And they cannot understand it, 
  for I had such plans one day; 
But I know what I surrendered 
  when I promised I'd go through; 
And I gained far more glory 
  since God made me over new."

am Stamm des Kreuzes schweben,
dein Heil sinkt in den Tod!
Der große Fürst der Ehren
läßt willig sich beschweren mit Schlägen,
Hohn und großem Spott.

Wer hat Dich so geschlagen,
mein Heil, und Dich mit Plagen
so übel zugericht'?
Du bist ja nicht ein Sünder wie wir
und unsere Kinder; von Übeltaten
weißt du nicht.

Ich, ich und meine Sünden,
die sich wie Körnlein finden
des Sandes an dem Meer,
die haben Dir erreget das Elend,
das Dich schläget, und das
betrübte Marterheer.

Ich bin's, sollte büßen,
an Händen und an Füßen gebunden,
in der Höll. Die Geißeln und die Banden,
und was Du ausgestanden, das hat 
verdienet meine Seel.

Du nimmst auf deinem Rücken die Lasten,
die mich drücken viel schwerer
als ein Stein.
Du wirst ein Fluch, dagegen verehrest Du
mir den Segen, Dein Leiden muß
mein Labsal sein.

Ich bin, mein Heil,
verbunden all Augenblick und Stunden
Dir überhoch und sehr.
Was Leib und Seel vermögen,
das will ich billig legen allzeit
an Deinem Dienst und Ehr.

Ich will mich mit dir schlagen ans Kreuz
und dem absagen, was meinem Fleisch
gefällt. Was Deine Augen hassen,
das will ich fliehn und lassen,
gefiel es auch der ganzen Welt."
2783;THE CIRCUIT RIDER/ Battle Hymn of the Republic;Ab;"The circuit-rider preacher 
  went riding through the land, 
With a rifle on his shoulder 
  and a Bible in his hand; 
He told the prairie people 
  of a blessed Promised Land, 
As he went riding, singing along.

Leaning, leaning, 
Leaning on the everlasting arm; 
Leaning, leaning, 
Leaning on the everlasting arm.

He preached the coming judgment 
  of fire and brimstone; 
And a glorious, endless Heaven 
  of the justified alone,
As he rode across the mountains 
you could hear him sing this song, 
As he went riding on.

There is power, power, 
wonder-working power, 
In the blood of the Lamb; 
There is power, power, 
wonder-working power, 
In the precious blood of the Lamb.

His rifle's old and rusty, 
  and it's hanging on the wall; 
His Bible's worn and dusty, 
  and it's seldom touched at all: 
But his Message from this Bible 
will meet us at Judgment Day, 
For God's Truth keeps marching on.

Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
His Truth is marching on.

Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
His Truth is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
His Truth is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on.

Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
Glory! glory, hallelujah! 
His Truth is marching on."

I've got a Father over yonder, 
I've got a Father over yonder, 
on the other shore.

Some bright day I'll go and see Him, 
Some bright day I'll go and see Him,
Some bright day I'll go and see Him, 
on the other shore.

Won't that be a happy meeting! 
Won't that be a happy meeting! 
Won't that be a happy meeting! 
On the other shore.

That bright day may be tomorrow, 
That bright day may be tomorrow,
That bright day may be tomorrow,

   as one of His fold? 
Would you be numbered 
   as one of His fold? 
Be spotless within, 
   be watching and waiting 
that sight to behold;

83;The Lily Of The Valley (OB 83);Eb / F;"I've found a friend in Jesus, 
He's everything to me. 
He's the fairest 
of ten thousand to my soul; 
The Lily of the Valley 
in Him alone I see, 
All I need to cleanse 
and make me fully whole. 

In sorrow He's my comfort, 
in trouble He's my stay, 
He tells me every care 
on Him to roll. Hallelujah!
He's the Lily of the Valley, 
the Bright and Morning Star. 
He's the fairest 
of ten thousand to my soul.

He all my griefs has taken, 
and all my sorrows borne; 
In temptation He's 
my strong and mighty tow'r; 
I have all for Him forsaken, 
and all my idols torn
From my heart, 
and now He keeps me by His power. 

Though all the world forsake me, 
and Satan tempt me sore,
Through Jesus I shall safely 
reach the goal. Hallelujah! 
He's the Lily of the Valley, 
the Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest 
of ten thousand to my soul.

He'll never, never leave me, 
nor yet forsake me here, 
While I live by faith 
and do His blessed will; 
A wall of fire about me, 
I've nothing now to fear;
With His manna 
He my hungry soul shall fill. 

Then sweeping up to glory, 
we'll see His blessed face, 
Where rivers of delight 
shall ever roll. Hallelujah!
He's the Lily of the Valley, 
the Bright and morning Star, 
He's the fairest 
of ten thousand to my soul."
85;WHEN I GET TO THE END (OB 85);C;"The sands have been washed in the footprints 
Of the Stranger on Galilee's shore, 
And the voice that subdued the rough billows, 
Will be heard in Judea no more.  
But the path of that lone Galilean 
  with joy I will follow today,
And the toils of the road will seem nothing, 
When I get to the end of the way. (2x) 

There are so many hills to climb upward, 
I often am longing for rest, 
But He who appoints me my pathway,
Knows just what is needful and best,
I know in His word He hath promised
That my strength, ""it shall be as my day."" 
And the toils of the road will seem nothing, 
When I get to the end of the way. (2x)

He loves me too well to forsake me 
Or give me one trial too much, 
All His people have been dearly purchased, 
And Satan can never claim such. 
By and by I shall see Him and praise Him, 
  in the city of unending day. 
And the toils of the road will seem nothing,
When I get to the end of the way. (2x) 

When the last feeble step has been taken, 
And the gates of that city appear, 
And the beautiful songs of the angels 
  float out on my listening ear.
When all that now seems so mysterious
Will be bright and as clear as the day.
Then the toils of the road will seem nothing. 
When I get to the end of the way. (2x)"
86;ROOM AT THE CROSS (OB 86);F;"The cross upon which Jesus died 
Is a shelter in which we can hide, 
And its grace so free is sufficient for me, 
And deep is its fountain; 
as wide as the sea.

CHORUS
There's room at the cross for you.
There's room at the cross for you.
Though millions have come, 
there's still room for one,
Yes, there's room at the cross for you.

Though millions have found Him a friend 
And have turned from 
the sins they have sinned. 
The Saviour still waits to open the gates, 
And welcome a sinner before it's too late.

The hand of my Saviour is strong 
And the love of my Saviour is long.
Through sunshine or rain, 
through loss or in gain, 
The blood flows from Calv'ry 
to cleanse every stain."
88;THE HAVEN OF REST (OB 88);G / Ab;"My soul in sad exile was out on life's sea, 
So burdened with sin and distressed, 
Till I heard a sweet voice saying, 
:""Make Me your choice;"" 
And I entered the ""Haven of Rest!""

CHORUS
I've anchored my soul in the haven of rest,
I'll sail the wild seas no more;
The tempest may sweep o'er the wild, stormy deep,
In Jesus I'm safe evermore.

I yielded myself to His tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, and I anchored my soul; 
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, since the Lord made me whole, 
Has been the old story, so blest, 
Of Jesus, who'll save whosoever will have 
A home in the ""Haven of Rest!""

How precious the thought that we all may recline, 
Like John, the beloved and blest, 
On Jesus' strong arm, where no tempest can harm. 
Secure in the ""Haven of Rest!""

O come to the Saviour, He patiently waits 
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul in the haven of rest, 
And say, ""My Beloved is mine."""
89;MUST JESUS BEAR ALONE? (OB 89);F / Ab;"Must Jesus bear the cross alone, 
And all the world go free? 
No, there's a cross for every one, 
And there's a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I'll bear, 
Till death shall set me free, 
And then go home my crown to wear, 
For there's a crown for me.

Upon the crystal pavement, down 
At Jesus' pierced feet, 
With joy I'll cast my golden crown, 
And His dear name repeat.

O precious cross! O glorious crown!
O resurrection day! 
Ye angels from the stars come down 
And bear my soul away."
90;Blessed Be The Name (OB 90);F / Ab;"All praise to him who reigns above 
In majesty supreme;
Who gave his Son for man to die, 
That he might man redeem.

CHORUS
Blessed be the name,
blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord;
Blessed be the name,
blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

His name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more, 
At God the Father's own right hand, 
Where angel hosts adore.

Redeemer, Savior, Friend of men
Once ruined by the fall; 
Thou hast devised salvation's plan, 
For thou hast died for all.

His name shall be the Counselor, 
The mighty Prince of Peace, 
Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror, 
Whose reign shall never cease."
91;I'm Going Through (OB 91);F / Ab;"Lord, I have started to walk in the light.
Shining upon me from heaven so bright; 
I bade the world and its follies adieu, 
I've started in Jesus and I'm going through.

CHORUS
I'm going through, yes, I'm going through.
I'll pay the price whatever others do,
I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few,
I'm going through, Jesus, I'm going through.

O there are many who start in the race,
But with the light refuse to keep pace;
Others accept it because it is new, 
But not very many expect to go through.

I'd rather walk with Jesus alone, 
Have for a pillow, like Jacob, a stone; 
Living each moment with His face in view,
Than shrink from my pathway and fail 
    to go through.

O brother, now will you take up the cross? 
Give up the world and count it as dross; 
Sell all thou hast and give to the poor, 
Then go through with Jesus and 
    those who endure."
92;SPEAK, MY LORD (OB 92);F / G;"Hear the Lord of harvest sweetly calling. 
""Who will go and work for Me today? 
Who will bring to Me the lost and dying? 
Who will point them to the narrow way?""

CHORUS
Speak, my Lord, speak my Lord,
Speak, and I'll be quick to answer Thee; 
Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord,
Speak, and I will answer, ""Lord, send me.""

When the coal of fire touched the prophet, 
Making him as pure as pure can be. 
When the voice of God, said ""Who'll go for us?"" 
The he answered, ""Here I am , send me.""

Millions now in sin and shame are dying; 
Listen to their sad and bitter cry; 
Hasten, brother, hasten to the rescue; 
Quickly answer, ""Master, here am I.""

Soon the time for reaping will be over;
Soon we'll gather for the harvest home;
May the Lord of harvest smile upon us,
May we hear His blessed, ""Child, well done."""
94;THE MEETING IN THE AIR (OB 94);G / Ab;"You have heard of little Moses
in the bulrush,
You have heard of fearless David

You have heard the story told
of dreaming Joseph,
And of Jonah and the whale
you often sing.

There are many, many others
through the Bible.
I should like to meet them all,
I do declare!
By and by the Lord will surely
let us meet them
At the meeting in the air.


There is going to be a meeting in the air,
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you,
meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky;

Such singing you will hear,
never heard by mortal ear,
'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son
will be the leading one
At the meeting in the air.


Many things will there be missing,
in that meeting;
For the mourners bench
will have no place at all; 
There will never be a sermon
preached to sinners,
For the sinner had refused
to heed the call.

There will be no mourning
over wayward loved ones,
There will be no lonely nights 
of pleading prayer; 
All our burdens and our anguish 
will be lifted 
At the meeting in the air.

There is going to be 
a meeting in the air,
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you,

In that home beyond the sky;

Such singing you will hear, 
never heard by mortal ear,
'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son
will be the leading one
At the meeting in the air.


There the doubters will be 
missing altogether, 
All the skeptics will be absent 
on that day; 
There will be no grumblers 
present to disturb us, 
And the Achans will be busy far away.

There the saints will have 
His ""seal upon their foreheads,
"" Dressed in raiment none 
but ransomed ones can wear; 
All who have the wedding garments 
will be present. 
At the meeting in the air.

There is going to be 
a meeting in the air,
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you, 
meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky;

Such singing you will hear,

'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son
will be the leading one
At the meeting in the air."

Make my life to be like a melody
Always telling out the story of the Cross.
With Jesus in my heart no discort can arise,
For He'll make the saddest heart to harmonise.
Make my life to be like a melody
Always telling out the story of the Cross.

Laat mijn leven zijn, vol van zonneschijn,

Met Jezus in mijn hart, is er geen onrust meer,

709;Abide With Me;;"Abide with me, 
Fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; 
Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail, 
And comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, 
O abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs 
Out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, 
Its glories pass away;
Change and decay in 
All around I see:
O Thou who changest not 
Abide with me

I need Thy presence 
Every passing hour; 
What but Thy grace can 
Foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my 
Guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, 
O abide with me.

I fear no foe, 
With Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, 
And tears no bitterness;
Where is death's sting? 
Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, 
If Thou abide with me.

Keep Thou Thy cross 
Before my closing eyes,
Shine through the gloom, 
And point me to the skies;
Heaven's morning breaks, 
And earth's vain shadows flee:
In life, in death, 
O Lord, abide with me!"

There are many dangers
 that we all must face,
If we die a fighting
 it is no disgrace,
A coward in the service,
 he will find no place,
So keep on the firing line.

Oh, you must fight,
 be brave against all evil,
Never run, nor ever lag behind
If you would win
 for God and the right,
Just keep on the firing line.

God will only use the soldier
 He can trust,
Keep on the firing line,
If you wear a crown, then 
 bear the cross you must,
Keep on the firing line,

Life is but to labor
 for the Master dear,
Help to banish evil
 and to spread good cheer,
Great you'll be rewarded
 for your service here,
So keep on the firing line.

Oh, you must fight,
 be brave against all evil,
Never run, nor ever lag behind
If you would win
 for God and the right,
Just keep on the firing line.

When we get on heaven, 
brother we'll be glad,
Keep on the firing line,
How we'll praise the Saviour
 for the call we had,
Keep on the firing line;

When we see the souls
 that we have helped to win,
Leading them to Jesus,
 from the paths of sin,
With a shout of welcome,
 we will all march in,
So keep on the firing line.

Oh, you must fight,
 be brave against all evil,
Never run, nor ever lag behind
If you would win
 for God and the right,
Just keep on the firing line."

100;THEN JESUS CAME (OB 100);C;"One sat alone beside the 
highway begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he 
could not see;
He clutched his rags and shivered 
in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and bade his 
darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the tempter's 
power is broken;
When Jesus comes, the tears 
are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the 
life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus 
comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil 
spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
He cut himself as demon pow'rs 
possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the 
captive free.

Unclean! unclean! The leper cried 
in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness 
stood near;
The fever raged, disease had gripped 
its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast 
out every fear.

So men today have found the 
Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion, 
lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them sad 
and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt 
Himself within."
102;THE WATER WAY ( OB 102);Eb / F;"Long ago the maids drew water
in the evening time, they say.
One day Isaac sent his servant
to stop Rebekah on her way.
""My master sent me here to tell thee;
see these jewels rich and rare;
would´st thou not his lovely bride be
in that country over there?""

CHORUS
It shall be light in the evening time,
the path to glory you will surely find;
thru the water way, It is the light today,
buried in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
Young and old, repent of all your sin,
the Holy Ghost will surely enter in;
the evening Light has come,
it is a fact that God and Christ are one.

So God´s servants come to tell you
of a Bridegroom in the sky,
looking for a holy people
to be His bride soon, by and by;
He sends to us refreshing water
in this wondrous latter day;
they who really will be raptured
must go thru the water way.

Are you on your way to ruin,
cumbered with a load of care?
See the quick work God is doing
that so His glory you may share.
At last the faith he once delivered
to the saints, is ours today;
to get in the church triumphant
you must go the water way.

Have you looked and often wondered
why the power is slack today?
Will you stay in that back number
and go on the man-made way?
Oh, saints who never have been buried
in the blessed name of God,
let the truth now sanctify you,
it´s the way apostles trod."

105;THAT MAN FROM GALILEE ( OB 105);Eb / F;"In a manger long ago,

A Babe was born 
To save men from their sin.
John saw Him on the shore, 
The Lamb forevermore,
Oh, the Christ, 
The Crucified of Calvary.

CHORUS
Oh I love that Man from Galilee,
For He's done so very much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins, 
Placed the Holy Ghost within;
Oh I love that man 
from Galilee.

The publican went to pray 
In the temple there one day,
He cried, ""O Lord 
be merciful to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this Man 
from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk, 
The dumb was made to talk,
That power was spoken with 
Love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man 
from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of Man 
What must he do.
These words He said to him, 
""Ye must be born again,""
By the Spirit of that Man 
from Galilee.

The woman at the well, 
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands 
She had at that time,
She was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that 
Man from Galilee!"""
107;In That City, Lamb Is The Light (OB 107);G / Bb;"There's a country far beyond the starry sky,

CHORUS
In that city where the Lamb is the light,
The city where there cometh no night;
I've a mansion over there, 
and when free from toil and care,
I am going where the Lamb is the light.

Here we have our days of sunshine, but we know 
That the sun which shines upon us now so bright 
Will be changed to clouds and rain until we go
To the City where the Lamb is the light.

There the flowers bloom forever and the day 
Shall be one eternal day without a night; 
And our tears shall be forever wiped away, 
In that city where the Lamb is the light.

Here we have our disappointments all the while, 
And our fondest hopes but meet with bitter blight; 
Though by night we weep, the morning brings a smile, 
In that city where the Lamb is the light.

Then let sunlight fade, let twilight bring its gloom. 
Not a shadow can my blissful soul affright; 
For I know that up in heaven there is room, 
In that city where the Lamb is the light."

Then will I sing praise
Amazing Grace
I once was lost but now I am found
I once was blind but now I see
Christ the mystery of God in me revealed

That day on Calvary
The elect Lady's way
The Lamb was slain in deep agony
When water and blood 
Came from His rib side
The price was paid
My soul He redeemed

As I heard the voice 
When He gave up the Ghost
I gave Him my life
And we became one flesh
In there I've found peace
In me is found rest
The union we cherish
And that's how I know Grace"

Our loved ones we shall meet, shall meet,
Upon the golden shore.
We're pilgrims and we're strangers here,
We're seeking a city to come,
The lifeboat soon is coming,
To gather the Jewels home.

Sometimes the Devil tempts me,
And says it's all in vain
To try to live a Christian life
And walk in Jesus' name;
But then we hear the Master say,
""I'll lend you a helping hand,
And if you'll only trust Me,
I'll guide you to the land.""

The lifeboat soon is coming,
By eyes of faith I see
As she sweeps through the waters
To rescue you and me,
And land us safely in the port
With friends we love so dear.
""Get ready,"" cries the Captain;
""Oh, look, she's almost here.""

Oh, now's the time to get on board,
While she is passing by;
But if you stand and wait too long, 
You shall forever die;
The fare is paid for one and all,
The Captain bids you come,
And get on board the lifeboat,
She'll carry you safely home."
117;It Shall Flow Like A River ( OB 117);C / Bb;"It shall flow like a river,
it shall fall like the rain,
it shall rise as the dew in the morning
o´er the plain;
for the knowledge of the Lord
shall fill all the earth
when the Spirit of the Lord shall fall.

Flow, river, flow;
flow, river, flow;
flow out through the nations
wherever man may go;
cause life to spring forth,
that all men may know
that You´re the river of the Spirit;
oh, flow, river, flow."
118;THE GREAT JUDGEMENT (OB 118);C;"I dreamed that the great judgment 
morning Had dawned, 
and the trumpet had blown; 
I dreamed that the nations had gathered 
To judgment before the white throne; 
From the throne came a bright shining angel,
And stood on the land and the sea, 
and swore with his hand 
raised to heaven, 
that time was no longer to be.

CHORUS
And O, what a weeping and wailing, 
as the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
They prayed, but their prayers were too late.

The rich man was there, 
but his money had melted and vanished away; 
A pauper he stood in the judgment, 
his debts were too heavy to pay; 
The great man was there, 
but his greatness, when death came, 
was left far behind.
The angel that opened the records, 
not a trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there with the orphans, 
God heard and remembered their cries; 
No sorrow in heaven forever. 
God wiped all the tears from their eyes; 
The gambler was there and the drunkard, 
And the man that had sold them the drink, 
With the people who gave him the license, 
together in hell they did sink.

The moral man came to the judgment, 
but his self-righteous rags would not do; 
The men who had crucified Jesus 
had passed off as moral men, too;
The soul that had put off salvation, 
""Not tonight; I'll get saved by and by,
No time now to think of religion!"" 
at last they had found time to die."
119;I Have Crossed The Riven Veil (OB 119);F / Ab;"I have crossed the riven veil 
where the glory never fails, 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah; 
I have crossed the riven veil 
where the glory never fails, 
For I'm living in the presence of the King."
122;JUST ANOTHER TOUCH, LORD (OB 122);C;"Just another touch, Lord, from you,
To help in hard trials I go through;
Though dark may be the night, 
You'll send a ray of light, 
When I get a touch, Lord, from you."
123;THE PEARLY WHITE CITY (OB 123);C / Eb;"There's a holy and beautiful city,
Whose builder and ruler is God. 
John saw it descending from heaven 
When Patmos, in exile, he trod; 
Its high, massive wall is of jasper, 
The city itself is pure gold; 
And when my frail tent here is folded, 
Mine eyes shall its glory behold.

CHORUS
In that bright city, pearly white city,
I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown;
Now I am watching, waiting and longing,
For the white city John saw coming down.


No sin is allowed in that city, 
And nothing defiling nor mean; 
No pain and no sickness can enter, 
No crape on the doorknob is seen; 
Earth's sorrows and cares are forgotten, 
No tempter is there to annoy; 
No parting words ever are spoken, 
There's nothing to hurt and destroy.

No heartaches are known in that city,
No tears ever moisten the eye, 
There's no disappointment in heaven, 
No envy and strife in the sky; 
The saints are all sanctified wholly, 
They live in sweet harmony there; 
My heart is now set on that city, 
And some day its blessings I'll share.

My loved ones are gathering yonder,
My friends, too, are passing away; 
And soon I shall join their bright number,
And dwell in eternity's day; 
They're safe now in glory with Jesus, 
Their trials and battles are past; 
They overcome sin and the tempter,
They've reached that fair city at last."
125;THE MESSAGE OF HIS COMING (OB 125);C / G / Bb;"We're looking for His coming,
in the clouds of heaven,
Coming back to earth 
to catch away His own;
Then may we all be ready, 
when midnight cry is given,
To go and reign with Christ 
on His throne.

Chorus
Gladly may we herald the message 
Of His blessed appearing,
Soon He's coming in glory, 
Tell to one and all;
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, 
Why slumber when the end is nearing,
But get ready for the final call.

We're longing for the glory 
that awaits the faithful,
Who shall overcome, 
and ev'ry conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward, 
the prize is life eternal
To all who win the fight over sin.

We're praying for the advent 
of our blessed Savior,
Who has promised life 
to all who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending, 
the message being given,
And soon we'll see our Lord 
face to face.

We see the signs appearing 
of His blessed coming,
Lo, behold the fig leaves 
now becoming green;
The gospel of His kingdom 
has gone to ev'ry nation;
That we are near the end 
can be seen."
126;THE SHEEP OF HIS PASTURE (OB 126);F;"The sheep of His pasture have gathered 
To hear what the Shepherd would say, 
His voice like the sound of slow waters, 
Came rippling through vessels of clay.

'Tis the voice that brought forth creation 
And set all the stars in array,
And speaks words of Life and of wisdom, 
In the midst of His people today.

Through prophets, by precious blood purchased, 
Cleansed and surrendered and filled. 
And set in the Body for service, 
As the Head of the Body hath willed."
128;Jesus Loves Me (OB 128);C / D / Eb;"Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak but He is strong.

CHORUS
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin.
Let His little child come in.

Jesus loves me! loves me still,
Though I'm very weak and ill;
From His shining throne on high,
Comes to watch me where I lie."
132;A WONDERFUL TIME (OB 132);Bb;"A wonderful time is just ahead, 
The Lord Whom we love and own 
Will open the gates of gloryland 
Revealing His glory throne.

CHORUS
A wonderful time for you,
A wonderful time for me;
If we are prepared to meet Jesus the King,
A wonderful time it will be.

A wonderful time is just ahead, 
Our conflicts and trials passed; 
Our wilderness journey at an end, 
Safe home everyone at last.

A wonderful time is just ahead, 
The groans of creation cease; 
And all that is held in bondage now 
The Lord will that day release."
133;WHEN HE REACHED DOWN (OB 133);C / Bb;"Once my soul was astray 
from the heavenly way, 
And was wretched 
and vile as could be; 
But my Saviour above, 
gave me peace, joy and love,
When He reached down 
His hand for me.

CHORUS
When He reached down 
His hand for me,
When He reached down 
His hand for me;
I was lost and undone, 
without God or His Son,
When He reached down 
His hand for me.

I was nearing despair, 
when He came to me there, 
And He showed me 
that I could be free; 
Then He lifted my feet, 
gave me glory complete, 
When He reached down 
His hand for me.

How my heart doth rejoice 
since I made Him my choice, 
From the tempest 
to Him now I flee; 
Now I lean on His arm 
I'm secure from all harm, 
Since he reached down 
His hand for me.

Since the Lord gave me peace, 
heavenly joys never cease; 
Lord, I give all my life unto Thee; 
Guide my feet, hold my hand, 
grant with Thee I may stand, 
For you reached down 
Your hand for me."
134;BRING THEM IN (OB 134);F / Ab;"Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who've gone astray,
Far from the Shepherd's fold away.

CHORUS
Bring them in, bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in, bring them in,
Bring the wand'ring ones to Jesus.

Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wand'ring ones to find?
Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold.
Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

Out in the desert hear their cry, 
Out on the mountains wild and high; 
Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee, 
""Go find My sheep where'er they be."""
139;HE ABIDES (OB 139);F;"I'm rejoicing night and day, 
As I walk the pilgrim way, 
For the hand of God 
in all my life I see, 
And the reason of my bliss, 
Yes, the secret all is this;
That the Comforter abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, He abides,
Hallelujah, He abides with me!
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin. 
Once I had no peace within, 
Till I heard how 
Jesus died upon the tree; 
Then I fell down at His feet, 
And there came a peace so sweet, 
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere, 
And He knows my every care, 
I'm as happy as a bird and just as free; 
For the Spirit has control, 
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me!

There's no thirsting for the things 
Of the world, they've taken wings; 
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly 
All my night was turned to day, 
All my burdens rolled away, 
Now the Comforter abides with me!"
140;REDEEMED (OB 140);F / Ab;"Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child, and forever, I am.

CHORUS
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus, 
No language my rapture can tell; 
I know that the light of His presence 
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessed Redeemer, 
I think of Him all the day long; 
I sing, for I cannot be silent; 
His love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty 
The King in whose law I delight; 
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps, 
And giveth me songs in the night."
141;NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD (0B 141);F / G;"What can wash away my sin? 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
What can make me whole again? 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

CHORUS
Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

For my cleansing this I see, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
For my pardon this my plea, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing can for sin atone, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
Naught of good that I have done, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
This is all my righteousness, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Now by this I'll overcome, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
Now by this I'll reach my home, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Glory! glory! thus I sing, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
All my praise for this I bring, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus."
145;ALL HAIL JESUS' NAME (OB 145);F / G;"All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name! 
Let angels prostrate fall; 
Bring forth the royal diadem, 
And crown Him Lord of all; 
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Ye seed of Israel's chosen race, 
Ye ransomed from the fall; 
Hail Him, who saves you by His grace, 
And crown Him Lord of all; 
Hail Him, who saves you by his grace, 
And crown Him Lord of all.

Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget
The wormwood and the gall, 
Go, spread your trophies at His feet, 
And crown Him Lord of all; 
Go, spread your trophies at His feet, 
And crown Him Lord of all.

Let every kindred, every tribe, 
On this terrestrial ball, 
To Him all majesty ascribe, 
And crown Him Lord of all; 
To Him all majesty ascribe, 
And crown Him Lord of all.

O that with yonder sacred 
throng we at His feet may fall; 
We'll join the everlasting song, 
And crown Him Lord of all; 
We'll join the everlasting  song, 
And crown him Lord of all."
148;ALMOST PERSUADED (OB 148);F / G;"""Almost persuaded,"" 
Now to believe;
""Almost persuaded,"" 
Christ to receive;
Seems now some soul to say,

Some more convenient day
On Thee I'll call.""

""Almost persuaded,"" 
Come, come today;
""Almost persuaded,"" 
Turn not away;
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are ling'ring near,
Prayers rise from hearts so dear,
Oh wand'rer, come.

""Almost persuaded,"" 
Harvest is past! 
""Almost persuaded,"" 
Doom comes at last!
""Almost"" cannot avail;
""Almost"" is but to fail!
Sad, sad, that bitter wail,
""Almost,"" but lost!"
149;NO DISAPPOINTMENT (OB 149);Eb;"There's no disappointment in heaven,
No weariness, sorrow or pain; 
No hearts that are bleeding and broken,
No song with a minor refrain. 
The clouds of our earthly horizon 
will never appear in the sky, 
For all will be sunshine and gladness, 
with never a sob nor a sigh.

CHORUS
I'm bound for that beautiful city
My Lord has prepared for His own;
Where all the redeemed of all ages 
Sing ""Glory!"" around the white throne;
Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven,
And the glories I there shall behold;
What a joy that will be when 
my Saviour I see,
In that beautiful city of gold!

We'll never pay rent for our mansion,
The taxes will never come due; 
Our garments will never grow threadbare,
But always be fadeless and new. 
We'll never be hungry nor thirsty, 
nor languish in poverty there. 
For all the rich bounties of heaven 
His sanctified children will share.

There'll never be crape on the doorknob, 
No funeral train in the sky; 
No graves on the hillsides of glory.
For there we shall nevermore die. 
The old will be young there forever.
Transformed in a moment of time;
Immortal we'll stand in His likeness.
The stars and the sun to outshine."

Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 
And tell its raptures all abroad.

Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day.
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!

O happy bond, that seals my vows 
To Him who merits all my love! 
Let cheerful anthems fill His house, 
While to that sacred shrine I move.

'Tis done; the great transaction's done!
I am my Lord's and He is mine; 
He drew me, and I followed on. 
Charmed to confess the voice divine."
152;I'll Be Listening (OB 152);F / Ab;"When the Saviour calls 
I will answer,
When He calls for me 
I will hear;
When the Saviour calls 
I will answer,
I'll be somewhere 
list'ning for my name.

I'll be somewhere list'ning, 
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
for my name;
I'll be somewhere list'ning, 
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
for my name.

If my heart is right 
when He calls me,
If my heart is right 
I will hear; 
If my heart is right 
when He calls me, 
I'll be somewhere 
list'ning for my name.

If my robe is white 
when He calls me,
if my robe is white 
I will hear; 
If my robe is white 
when He calls me, 
I'll be somewhere 
list'ning for my name."
280;No one ever cared like Jesus;C;"I would love to tell you
What I think of Jesus,
Since I found in Him a Friend
So strong and true;
I would tell you how
He changed my life completely,
He did something that
No other friend could do.

Chorus
No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
There's no other friend so kind as He;
No one else could take the sin
And darkness from me,
O how much He cared for me

All my life was full of sin
When Jesus found me,
All my heart was full
Of misery and woe;
Jesus placed His strong
And loving arms about me,
And He led me in the way I ought to go.

Ev'ry day He comes to me
With new assurance,
More and more I understand
His words of love;
But I'll never know just why
He came to save me,
Till someday I see His blessed face above."
354;I Have A Source;G;"I have a source of strength 
When i am weak,
That takes me thru 
When life is pressing me.
I have a source of power from above;
I'm covered over by a shield of love

Chorus
I claim the blood Jesus 
Shed on Calvary,
Those precious blood stains 
Where made there just for me
For all my sin my sickness 
and my pain
When i need healing 
That's when i claim 
Those precious blood stains.

I do not know
How others make it thru,
Who never go...
To Clavary as I do.
Where there's a healing,
Cleansing stream still flows
With peace that only
His redeemed can know"

Please wash me anew
In the wine of Your Blood"

Coming down from the sky.
How art thou fallen son of the morning
You thought you could exalt yourself so high.
You were the one who weakened the nations,
Put this world in so much sin.
Paise God your power has been broken,
Since the Lord Almighty Conqueror entered in,
Freed us from sin.

Now I look unto redemption,
The abstract title deed has come.
Showing me that way unto perfection,
For this wicked world of sin I'll overcome"

153;THE HOMECOMING WEEK (OB 153);Eb / F / G;"Upon our journey here below 
we meet with pain and loss;
Sometimes there is a crown of thorns,
sometimes the heavy cross.
The dreary road to Calvary,
the bitter goad and sting,
But what's inside those gates of pearl
will be worth everything.

CHORUS
When we're inside the gates of pearl,
We'll learn a lot of things,
We'll have a harp that's made of gold,
Perhaps a thousand strings;
We'll sing and shout and dance about,
The Lamb will dry our tears;
We'll have a grand homecoming week,
The first ten thousand years.

The shadows now begin to fall,
the time is drawing nigh,
When Christ our Lord shall come again
like lightning from the sky.
And while we wait and suffer here, 
praise God, we'll shout and sing,
For one glimpse through those gates
of pearl will be worth everything.

The precious blood of God's own Son
has saved and sanctified
A wondrous people for His name 
and they are called the Bride.
Though here neglected and despised,
one day the Lord will bring
His chosen ones within the gates,
and that's worth everything."
155;PEACE IN THE VALLEY (OB 155);C / Eb;"Well, I'm tired and so weary, 
But I must go along;

And the night, night is as fair 
As the day, oh yes.

CHORUS
There will be peace in the valley 
For me some day;
There will be peace in the valley 
For me, oh, Lord, I pray;
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow,
no trouble I'll see;
There will be peace 
In the valley for me.

There the flow'rs will be blooming, 
And the grass will be green;
And the skies will be clear 
And serene, oh, yes;
Well the sun ever beams, 
In this valley of dreams;
And no clouds there will ever 
Be seen,oh, yes.

Well, the bear will be gentle, 
And the wolf will be tame;
And the lion shall lay down 
By the lamb, oh, yes;
Well the beast from the wild, 
Shall be led by a little child;
And I'll be changed, changed 
From this creature that I am, oh, yes."
156;Great Is The Lord  (OB 156);Eb / Bb;"There is a Name I love to hear,

CHORUS
Great is the Lord! Great is the Lord!
Great is the Father, great is the Son,
Great is the Holy Ghost,

He is the dear Saviour of men, 
He gave His own life just to free

Beyond the sunset, when day is done.

Beyond the sunset now clouds will gather, 
No storms will threaten, no fears annoy. 
O day of gladness, O day unending; 
Beyond the sunset, eternal joy.

Beyond the sunset, a hand will guide me 
To God, the Father, whom I adore; 
His glorious presence,  is words of welcome, 
Will be my portion on that fair shore.

Beyond the sunset, O glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones who've gone before. 
In that fair homeland we'll know no parting, 
Beyond the sunset forevermore."

The signs that the prophets foretold;
The Gentile days numbered,

Eternity soon will unfold.

CHORUS
The day of redemption is near,
Men's hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit, 
your lamps trimmed and clear,
Look up! Your redemption is near.

The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem's restoring 
Her national life, long dethroned; 
Today she is calling, 
her latter rain's falling. 
""Return, O dispersed, to your own.""

Heaven's powers are shaking, 
and many are mistaking 
God's meaning to be of the sky; 
God's Church is the power 
that's shaking this hour; 
The day of redemption is nigh.

False prophets are lying. 
God's Truth they're denying, 
That Jesus the Christ is our God; 
Though this generation 
spurns God's revelation, 
We'll walk where 
the apostles have trod."

when I entered the gate I cried ""Holy"",
the angels all met me there;
they showed me from mansion to mansion,
and oh, the sights I saw,
but I said: ""I want to see Jesus,
the One who died for all.""

CHORUS
Then I bowed on my knees and cried:
""Holy, Holy, Holy"".
I clapped my hands and sang: ""Glory,
Glory to the Son of God.""

I thought when I entered that city,
my friends knew me well,
they showed me all through heaven,
the scenes are too num`rous to tell;
they showed me Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
Mark, Luke and Timothy,
but I said: ""I want to give praise,
to the One who died for me.""

I thought when I saw my Saviour:
Oh! Glory to God!
I just fell right down before Him,
singing: ""Praise to the name of the Lord!""
I bowed down and worshipped Jehovah,
my friend of Calvary,
for I wanted to give praise to Jesus,
for saving a sinner like me."
177;THE CLOUD AND FIRE (OB 177);Eb / E;"As of old, when the hosts of Israel
Were compelled in the wilderness to dwell,
Trusting they in their God to lead the way 
To the light of perfect day.

CHORUS
So the sign of the fire by night,
And the sign of the cloud by day,
Hovering o'er, just before,
As they journey on their way,
Shall a guide and a leader be,
Till the wilderness be past.
For the Lord, our God, in His
own good time
Shall lead to the light at last.

To and fro, as a ship without a sail,
Not a compass to guide them through the vale,
But the sign of their God was ever near, 
Thus their fainting hearts to cheer.

All the days of their wand'rings they were fed. 
To the land of the promise they were led; 
By the hand of the Lord in guidance sure, 
They were brought to Canaan's shore."
178;I Won't Cross The Jordon Alone (OB 178);C / Eb;"When I come to the river at ending of day, 
When the last winds of sorrow have blown;

I won't have to cross Jordan alone,
Jesus died all my sins to atone;
When the darkness I see, 
He'll be waiting for me,
I won't have to cross Jordan alone.

Oftentimes I'm forsaken, 
and weary and sad, 
When it seems that my friends have all gone; 
There is one thought that cheers me 
and makes my heart glad, 
I won't have to cross Jordan alone.

Though the billows of sorrow 
and trouble may sweep, 
Christ the Saviour will care for His own; 
Till the end of the journey, 
my soul He will keep, 
I won't have to cross Jordan alone."
179;SOFTLY AND TENDERLY (OB 179);G / Ab;"Softly and tenderly

He's waiting and watching,
Watching for you and for me.

CHORUS
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary, come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, 
Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home!

Why should we tarry 
When Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger 
And heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

Time is now fleeting, 
The moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering, 
Deathbeds are coming,
Coming for you and for me.

Oh! for the wonderful love 
He has promised,
Promised for you and for me;
Though we have sinned, 
He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me."
180;CLOSE TO THEE (OB 180);F / G;"Thou, my everlasting portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior let me walk with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
All along my pilgrim journey,

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Nor for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me through the vale of shadows,
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Then the gate of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee."
181;Got Any Rivers (OB 181);E / Ab;"""Be of good courage"",
God spoke unto Joshua
when o´er the river
God pointed the way;
Jordan uncrossable,
things seemed impossible,
waters divide as
they march and obey.

CHORUS
Got any rivers
you think are uncrossable?
Got any mountains
you can`t tunnel through?
God specializes
in things thought impossible
and He will do what
no other po`er can do.  

Battles to win! They would
meet with their obstacles,
Jericho`s walls, too,
must fall to the ground.
God never failed;
He stood back
of His promises,
walls had to crumble
as they marched around.

God is the same
and His Word is dependable,
He`ll make a way
through the waters for you;
life`s situations
by him are amendable,
mountains and hills
He will part for you, too."
183;LIFT HIM UP (OB 183);F / Ab;"How to reach the masses,
men of every birth?
For an answer Jesus gave a key:
""And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
will draw all men unto me.""

CHORUS
Lift Him up, lift Him up,
still He speaks from eternity:
""And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
will draw all men unto me.""

Oh, the world is hungry
 for the living bread,
Lift the Saviour up for them to see;
Trust Him, and do not doubt the words
  that He said, 
""I`ll draw all men unto me.""

Don`t exalt the preacher, 
don`t exalt the pew,
Preach the Gospel simple, full and free;
Prove Him and you will find that
 promise is true:
""I`ll draw all men unto me.""

Lift Him up by living as 
a Christian ought,
Let the world in you the Saviour see,
Then men will gladly follow Him who
once taught:
""I`ll draw all men unto me."""

And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.

Chorus
Oh Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.
As on Thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory-shore,
My Heaven, my home forevermore!

My Savior comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by the hand, 
For this is heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from eververnal trees,
And flow'rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody.
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song."
185;THE LORD BROUGHT ME OUT;Eb;"I'm so glad that the Lord brought me
out; I'm so glad that the Lord brought

out.

Aren't you glad that the Lord brought
you out? Aren't you glad that the Lord
brought you out? If it had not been
for Jesus, oh where would I be? I'm so
glad that the Lord brought me out.

I've been singing since the Lord
brought me out, I've been singing since
the Lord brought me out; If it had not
been for Jesus, oh where would I be?
I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out."
2907;PAST THE CURTAIN OF TIME;Eb;"There's a curtain that's drawn between
earth and Heaven, And just beyond
lies a beautiful clime Where the evils
of this life no longer can touch me;
Lord, let me look past the curtain of

CHORUS
Lord, let me look past the curtain
of sorrows and fear.
Let me view that sunny bright
clime;
It would strengthen my faith and
would banish all fear;
Lord, let me look past the curtain
of time.

I'm helpless, alone, and I want to see
Jesus, And hear the sweet harbor bells
chime, Where my friends and dear
loved ones are waiting for me; Lord,
let me look past the curtain of time.

I'm so homesick and blue, and I want
to see Jesus, I would like to hear those
sweet harbor bells chime; It would
brighten my path and would vanish all
fear; Lord, let me look past the curtain
of time."

There's Honey in the Rock for you;
Leave your sins for the blood to cover,
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Have you ""tasted that the Lord is
gracious?"" Do you walk in the way
that's new? Have you drank from the
living Fountain? There's Honey in the
Rock for you.

Do you pray unto God the Father,
""What wilt thou have me to do?""
Never fear He will surely answer;
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Then go out through the streets and
byways, Preach the word to the many
or few; Say to every fallen brother,
There's Honey in the Rock for you."
201;THE GREAT PHYSICIAN (0B 201);Eb;"The great Physician now is near, 
The sympathizing Jesus,

Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;

CHORUS
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue,

Jesus, blessed Jesus.

Your many sins are all forgiven, 
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus; 
Go on your way in peace to heaven, 
And wear a crown with Jesus.

All glory to the dying Lamb! 
I now believe in Jesus;

No other name but Jesus; 
O how my soul delights to hear 
The charming name of Jesus."

There's a work for all to do;
Hark! the Master's voice is calling,
To the harvest calling you.

Chorus
Little is much when God is in it!
Labor not for wealth or fame;
There's a crown, and you can win it,
If you go in Jesus' name.

Does the place you're called to labor
Seem so small and little known?
It is great if God is in it,
And He'll not forget His own.

When the conflict here is ended
And our race on earth is run,
He will say, if we are faithful,
""Welcome home, My child - well done!""

In the mad rush of the broad way,
In the hurry and the strife,
Tell of Jesus' love and mercy,
Give to them the Word of Life.

Are you laid aside from service,
Body worn from toil and care?
You can still be in the battle,
In the sacred place of prayer."
3591;My Faith has found A Resting Place;G;"My faith has found a resting place,
Not in device nor creed;
I trust the Ever-living One,
His wounds for me shall plead.

Chorus
I need no other argument
I need no other plea,
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.

Enough for me that Jesus saves,
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him,
He'll never cast me out.

My heart is leaning on the Word,
The written Word of God,
Salvation by my Saviour's Name,
Salvation through His blood.

The lost He came to save:
For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life he gave."

Take up your cross and follow me
I answer Him ""Here I am faithful Saviour,

Chorus
I will follow you to the end
On good and bad days
I will live and die for you
Jesus I'm Yours always

We have to leave those we love
And endure being misjudged and insulted
And dsepised by the world

The way to Calvary is straight and narrow
It's a road that is solitary

We have to lose our own life
And have nothing of our own
But love Jesus alone

Christ gives grace and glory
To follow Him step by step
With joy, victory, pleace 
And happiness here below"
3604;The Unseen Hand;F;"There is an unseen hand to me,
That leads in ways I cannot see
While going through this world of woe,
This hand still leads me as I go.

CHORUS
I'm trusting to, the unseen hand,
That guides me through this weary land
When some sweet day I'll reach that strand,
Still guided by the unseen hand

This hand has led through shadows drear
And while it leads I have no fear
I know t'will lead, me to that home
Where sin nor sorrow e'er can come

I long to see, my Savior's face
And sing the story saved by grace
And there upon that golden  strand
I'll praise him for His guiding hand"

Dikwijls drukt ons zonde neer,

In 't gebed tot onze Heer

Leidt de weg soms door verzoeking,
Dat ons hart in 't strijduur beeft,
Gaan wij dan met al ons lijden
Tot Hem, die verlossing geeft.

CHORUS
Long ago, long ago,
Yes the old account 
was settled long ago.
And the records cleared today,
for He washed my sins away,
When the old account 
was settled long ago.

The old account was large,
and larger ev'ry day,
For I was always sinning,
and never tried to pay.
But when I looked ahead,
and saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle,
and settled long ago.

When at the judgment bar,
I stand before my King.
And He the Book will open
and can not find a thing.
Then will my heart be glad,
while tears of joy will flow,
Because I had it settled,
and settled long ago.

When in that happy home,
my Saviour's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story,
and praise Him for His love.
I'll not forget that book,
with pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled,
and settled long ago.

O sinner seek the Lord,
repent of all your sin,
For thus He has commanded,
if you would enter in.
And then if you should live,
a hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it,
you settled long ago."

They have rejected God's revelation

And an anchor to your soul.
All the evil of this world you've overcome.

CHORUS
Nowe more than conquerors we are
Through the power of Jesus' Name.
Priests and kings he has made us
And forever we shall reign.

Many pressures came outside and within
And temptations did arise to take a look
Unto the other side.
But by the grace of God we resisted sin
And the devils were surprised.
We knew by  the Word of the Lord
We were tested and tried.
But unto you who look above
Through the windows of perfect love.
God has sent to us His Son
On the wings of a dove.

As the new ministry becomes reality
Now men will see with their eyes
The Work of God expressed 
Through His little Bride.
Every knee must bow, every tongue confess
Men's folly be made manifest.
The foolish man won't be able to understand.
But unto the wise who understand
Great exploits are now at hand.
For Michael's feet are on the sea and on the land."

ask what you will believing

And we know that we're at the end

But the Bride knows that Jesus is here

The Seals are opened calling the roll
Rejoice my brother/sister He's come again
Let's climb higher Jesus is come
With the rapture Jesus is come
Rejoice my brother/sister He's come again

Brother, don't give up; the world may keep back
As long as you know that He's come again

Don't you see that He's come again

Saying: ""Look up, behold Christ!""
In 1963 He was seen
On a cloud He came down"

De Naam van Jezus die ik nu belijd.

And He saw my past thourgh mercifyl eyes.

Chorus
Beautiful! That's how mercy saw me;
For I was broken and so lost,
mercy looked past my faults.
Justice of God saw what I had done,
mercy saw me thourhg the Son;
Not what I was but what I could be;
that's how mercy saw me.

Whatever you've done you can't go too far,
That His eys of mercy can't see where you are.
He loves you too much to leave you alone,
You're flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone.
Yet His heart crys out for your heart today.

He made a road in the wilderness
And the Power of Love broke through

A falling creation
In need of salvation
With no open road to the Love they've lost
But the Father how made them
He reached down and forgave them
And opened up a way on a rugged cross

He made a road in the wilderness
As only He could do
He made a road in the wilderness
And the Power of Love broke through

At the end of all ages

By sending a prophet as of old
God opened up a way

Just do what the prophet has told

We have an anchor

Steadfast and sure 
  while the billows roll
Fastened to the rock

Grounded firm and deep

It is safely moor'd, 
  'twill the storm withstand, 
For 'tis well secured 
  by the Savior's hand
And the cables, pass'd 
  from His heart to mine,
Can defy the blast, 
  thru strength divine

It will firmly hold 
  in the straits of fear,
When the breakers have told 
 the reef is near
Tho' the tempest rave 
  and the wild winds blow,
Not an angry wave 
  shall our bark o'erflow.

It will surely hold 
  in the floods of death,
When the waters cold 
  chill our latest breath.
On the rising tide 
  it can never fail.
While our hopes abide 
  within the veil.

When our eyes behold 
  thru the gath'ring night
The city of gold,
 our harbour bright,
We shall anchor fast 
  by the heav'nly shore,
With the storms all past 
 forever more."

The Son of God they would not deny,
like the great and gently pride saints,
I can almost hear their voices say

CHORUS
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb,
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honour His commands.
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb.

Now the years have come, 
  and the years have gone.
But the cause of Jesus, still goes on.
Now the time has come, to count the cost,
To reject the world, to embrace the cross.
So one by one let us live our lives,
For the One who died to give us life.
Till the trumpet sounds on that final day,
Let us proudly stand, and boldly say.

To the Lamb of God, who bore my pain,
Who took my place, who wore my shame.
I will seek to honour His commands,
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb."

And the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.

The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.
The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in You.
With all life's frustrations, I need You, I know I do.
'Cause the only real peace that I have, dear Lord,
is in You.

and sometimes I've wondered if dreams are worth dreamin at all.

Not when I'm reminded of sweet peace I have, Lord, in You."

That sudden secret going away
We are longing for the rapture

As long as He lives
In my soul He reigns

In the resurrection
That morning hearing will recognize the voice
That cried out 'Lazarus come forth!'"

Many have searched the whole wide world
And still can´t seem to find it
Love is patient, love is kind

True love can never be broken
Love endureth all things
And love suffers long
Love is God and God is love
Who is our King
So how can we know true love
without knowing Him

Many waters cannot quench love, 
neither can the floods drown it (4x)
So whoever God joins together,
let no man put asunder

Therefore shall a man leave mother and father
And cleave unto his wife
Then they shall be no more twain
But they shall be one
Then he'll love his bride as Christ the church
Giving himself for it

For no man yet hateth his flesh
But loveth and cherished it
Love is God and God is love
Who is our King
So how can we know true love 
without knowing Him

Many waters cannot quench love, 
neither can the floods drown it (4x)
So whoever God joins together,
let no man put asunder"

that brought me out of darkness,
And to the light
where I can clearly see;
I'll shout it from the mountains
and the valleys,
He looked beyond my faults
and saw my needs.

That this Holy Ghost fire
Will make you want to shout

From his mothers belly

The prophet Jeremiah
Would lift his voice and cry
Be quiet! Folks commanded
Go home and leave us alone
But he said, How can you be quiet?
When theres fire in my bone

Its just like fire
And its shut up in my bones
Its that Holy Ghost fire
And its shut up in my bones

Some people get offended
Because I dance and shout
They say that's too much emotion
And too much moving about
But don't tell me to be quiet
Or go sit down in some pew
If you feel what I felt
I know you will be shouting too"

With the love I've never felt before

Wij verwelkomen jou in ons kaasland,

Sa- Sa- Sa Sarah,
Jij komt nu naar Holland,
Sa- Sa- Sa Sarah,
Jij bent vandaag de bruid
Ja Sarah, voor jou zet hij alles opzij 
Hij heeft lang op jou gewacht.

Sarah een duitse, spreekt haar eigen taal,
Die Erwin schon wunderbar spricht
Begin jij nu eens met een hollands verhaal
In plaats van, ""Versteh Dich nicht"".
Jouw bloemen, jouw ogen, jouw lach en jouw rust
'n perfecte Frau ben jij voor hem.
Maar zorg dan wel voor echt Duits vlees in de pan
Duits vlees vindt hij beter dan....

Erwin een vrouwtje kost centen, heel veel
Heb jij daar wel goed aan gedacht
Niet alles voor jou , maar voor ieder z'n deel
Een zuinige tijd je die wacht
Geen Appie, mac Donalds, en Piet Zoomers meer
Daar heeft die de centen niet voor
Het word ALdi, de Lidl en Zeeman echt waar
En nu met z'n allen in koor"
233;Unworthy;C;"Unworthy am I of the grace that He gave,
Unworhy to hold to His Hand.
Amazed that a King would
Reach down to a slave,
This love I cannot understand

Chorus
Unworthy, unworthy, a beggar,
In bondage and alone,
But He made me worthy
And now by His grace,
His mercy has made me His own.

My sorrow and sickness
Laid stripes on His back
My sins caused the Blood that was shed.
My faults and my failures
Have woven a crown
Of thorns, that He wore on His Head.

Unworthy am I of the glory to come,
Unworthy with angels to sing.
I thrill just to know that
He loved me so much.
A pauper, I walk with the King,"
325;Canaan's land is just in sight;Eb;"Moses led God's children,
Forty years he led them,
Thru the cold and thru the night.
Though they said, Let's turn back,
Moses said, keep going-
Canaan's land is just in sight

Chorus
There will be no sorrow,
There in that tomorrow,
We will be there by and by.
Milk and honey flowing,
That is where I'm going-
Canaan's land is just in sight.

Though we walk thru valleys,
Though we climb high mountains,
We must not give up the fight.
We must be like Moses,
We must keep on going-
Canaan's land is just in sight.

God sent us a prophet
Just like unto Moses
He taught us the way of right
From beyond the curtain
He was told ""Keep pressing""
Canaan's land is just in sight."
798;Father I Place Into Your Hand;Ab;"Father, I place into Your hands
The things I cannot do.

The way that I should go,
For I know I always can trust You.

Father, I place into Your hands
My friends and family.
Father, I place into Your hands
The things that trouble me.
Father, I place into Your hands
The person I would be,
For I know I always can trust You.

Father, we love to see Your face,
We love to hear Your voice.
Father, we love to sing Your praise
And in Your name rejoice.
Father, we love to walk with You
And in Your presence rest,
For we know we always can trust You.

Father, I want to be with You
And do the things You do.

That You are speaking too.
Father, I want to love the ones
That You will draw to You,
For I know that I am one with You."
283;God's Wonderful People;Eb;"Oh, what joy His love affords
When we meet in one accord,
And we lift our hearts in praise
Unto the Lord;
There's no place I'd rather be
Than with the ones who've been set free,
I'm so glad I'm in God's great big family.

Chorus
I love the thrill that I feel when I get
Together with God's wonderful people,
Love the thrill that I feel
When I get together with 
God's wonderful people;
What a sight just to see
All the happy faces
Praising God in heavenly places;
What a thrill that I feel
When I get together with
God's wonderful people.

It can be just anywhere
Two or three are gathered there,
That the Spirit of the Lord
Will be there, too;
There's no fellowship so sweet,
There's no thrill that can compete
With the thrill that I feel whenever
God's children  meet.

On that great reunion day
When our Lord says, 'Come away,'
And the saints from ev'ry land
Sweep through the gates;
Joining loved ones 'round the throne,
At last we'll all be gathered home,
That will be the greatest thrill
We've ever known."

Let the shower of blessing fall;
We are waiting, we are waiting,
Oh, revive the hearts of all.

God is here! we feel His presence
In this consecrated place;
But we need the soul refreshing
Of His free, unbounded grace.

God is here! oh, then, believing,
Bring to Him our one desire,
That His love may now be kindled,
Till its flame each heart inspire.

While in simple faith we bow,
From the windows of Thy mercy
Pour us out a blessing now."

Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fire and cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through.
Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,
Be Thou still my Strength and Shield;
Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.

Lord, I trust Thy mighty power,
Wondrous are Thy works of old;
Thou deliver’st Thine from thralldom,
Who for naught themselves had sold:
Thou didst conquer, Thou didst conquer,
Sin, and Satan and the grave,
Sin, and Satan and the grave.

When I tread the verge of Jordan,
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Death of deaths, and hell’s destruction,
Land me safe on Canaan’s side.
Songs of praises, songs of praises,
I will ever give to Thee;
I will ever give to Thee.

Musing on my habitation,
Musing on my heav’nly home,
Fills my soul with holy longings:
Come, my Jesus, quickly come;
Vanity is all I see;
Lord, I long to be with Thee!
Lord, I long to be with Thee!"

’Tis recorded in His Word, Hallelujah!
It is only that you look and live.

I’ve a message full of love, Hallelujah!
A message, O my friend for you;
’Tis a message from above, Hallelujah!
Jesus said it and I know ’tis true.

Life is offered unto you, Hallelujah!
Eternal life your soul shall have,
If you only look to Him, Hallelujah!
Look to Jesus Who alone can save.

I will tell you how I came, Hallelujah!
To Jesus, when He made me whole;
’Twas believing on His Name, Hallelujah!
I trusted and He saved my soul."

Give us a light to light the way
Into the land of perfect day;

Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountain till the break of day;
Into the light of perfect day,
It will give out a lovely ray;

In that land where no one 
ever knows a care;
And the Christians of all ages 
will join in the triumph song,
Ev'rybody will be happy over there.

We will hear nobody praying 
and no mourning in that land,
For no burdens there will be
for us to bear;
All the people will be singing 
""Glory, glory to the Lamb,""
Ev'rybody will be happy over there.

There we'll meet the One who saved us
and who brought us to that land so
bright and fair;
We will praise His name forever as we
look upon His face,
Ev'rybody will be happy over there."

But she knew she had to touch Him;
For it was her last chance
Of ever being healed
She pressed through the crowd,
Reached out and touched His garment
And right then and there 
Her miracle was fulfilled.

Chorus
There's a miracle in the making;
One just for you, 
The Father is working even now.
Your prayers have been heard
And the answer's on the way;
There's a miracle in the making 
For you today.

Have you prayed and prayed
But still there seems you've heard no answer;
Has your faith grown weak 
And you feel all alone;
Don't give up the fight, God you serve
won't leave you;
For there's a miracle 
In the making for you today."
266;Because He Lives;F;"God sent His Son, 
they called Him Jesus;
He came to love heal and forgive;
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove, 
My Saviour lives.

Chorus
Because He lives 
I can face tomorrow;
Because He lives 
All fear is gone;
Because I know 
He holds the future,
And life is worth the living
Just because He lives

I'll cross the river;
I'll fight life's final war with pain;
And then as death gives way to vict'ry,
I'll see the lights of glory and
I'll know He reigns."

The Son of God discloses.

Chorus
And He walks with me,
And He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share 
  as we tarry there
None other has ever known.

He speaks and the sound 
  of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush 
  their singing;
And the melody that He 
  gave to me
Within my heart is ringing.

Tho the night around me be falling;
But He bids me go -

His voice to me is calling."

896;How Deep The Father's Love;D / E;"How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.

Behold the Man upon a cross
My guilt upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that It is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no pow'rs, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom"

And I will trust in You alone
For Your endless mercy follows me
Your goodness will lead me home

He guides my ways in righteousness
And anoints my head with oil
And my cup it overflows with joy

I will not fear the evil one
For You are with me
And Your rod and staff
Are the comfort I need to know"

To be had in this world thro' the blood.

Even now, while we taste of His love,
We are filled with delight thro' His name;
But what will it be when, up above,
We shall join in the song of the Lamb?

Then we'll march in His name till we come,
At His bidding, to cease from the fight,
And our Saviour shall welcome us home
To the regions of glory and light.

Till the crown from His hand we receive,
And the King in His glory we see!"

Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Always, only for my King.

God will make this trial a blessing

When I was in that lowest valley

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Here there by Thy great help I've come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

Oh, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let that goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above"
