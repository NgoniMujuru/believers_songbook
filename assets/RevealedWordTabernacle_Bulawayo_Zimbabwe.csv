In that country over there?""

The evening Light has come,
It is a fact that God and Christ are one.

Of a Bridegroom in the sky,
Looking for a holy people.
To be His Bride soon, by and by;
He sends to us refreshing water
In this wondrous latter day;
they who really will be raptured
Must go through the water way

Are you on your way to ruin,
Cumbered with a load of care?
See the quick work God is doing
That so His glory you may share.
At last the faith He once delivered
To the saints is ours today;
To get in the Church triumphant 
You must go the water way.

have you looked and often wondered
Why the power is slack today?
Will you stay in the back number
And go on in the man-made way?
O saints who never have been buried
In the blessed name of God,
Let the truth now sanctify you;
It's the way apostles trod"

To sound out His Command
To gather all the Saints of God
To enter the promised Land"

All will be peace;
Heartaches all ended, 
School days all done,
Heaven will open, 
Jesus will come.

CHORUS
Some golden daybreak, 
Jesus will come;
Some golden daybreak, 
Battles all won,
He'll shout the victory, 
Break through the blue,
Some golden daybreak, 
For me, for you.

Sad hearts will gladden, 
All shall be bright,
Good-bye forever 
To earth's dark night;
Changed in a moment, 
Like Him to be,
Oh, glorious daybreak, 
Jesus I'll see.

Oh, what a meeting, 
There in the skies,
No tears nor crying 
Shall dim our eyes;
Loved ones united 
Eternally,
Oh, what a daybreak 
That morn will be."
207;Oh How I Love Jesus;F;"There is a name 
I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music 
in mine ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Jesus,
Oh how I love Jesus,
Oh how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.

It tells me of a Saviour's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood;
The sinner's perfect plea.

It tells me what 
my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread 
a darksome path,
Yields sunshine 
all the way.

It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part,
That none can bear below.

To me, You are so wonderful,
To me, You are so wonderful,
To me, You are so wonderful,
Because You first loved me."
208;Fill My Way With Love;Eb;"Let me walk, blessed Lord, 
in the way Thou hast gone,
Leading straight to the land above;
Giving cheer everywhere, 
to the sad and the lone,
Fill my way every day with love.

CHORUS
Fill my way every day with love,
As I walk with the heavenly Dove;
Let me go all the while, with 
a song and a smile,
Fill my way every day with love.

Keep me close to the side of 
my Saviour and Guide,
Let me never in darkness rove;
Keep my path free from wrath, 
and my soul satisfied,
Fill my way every day with love.

Soon the race will be o'er, and 
I'll travel no more,
But abide in my home above;
Let me sing, blessed King, 
all the way to the shore,
Fill my way every day with love."
209;I Love Him;C;"Gone from my heart the world
and all its charms;
Now, through the blood, 
I'm saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart 
is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus 
cleanses white as snow.

CHORUS
I love Him, I love Him
Because He first loved me
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary's tree.

Once I was lost, and 'way 
down deep in sin,
Once was a slave to passions 
fierce within;
Once was afraid to 
trust a loving God;
But now I'm cleansed from every 
stain through Jesus' blood.

Once I was bound, 
but now I am set free;
Once, I was blind, but now 
the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now 
in Christ I live,
To tell the world around 
the peace that He doth give."
210;Zion's Hill;F;"There waits for me 
a glad tomorrow,
Where gates of pearl swing 
open wide,
And when I've passed this 
vale of sorrow,
I'll camp upon the other side.

CHORUS
Some day beyond the reach 
of mortal ken,
Some day, God only knows 
Just where and when,
The wheels of mortal life 
Shall all stand still,
And I shall go to dwell 
on Zion's hill.

Some day I'll hear the 
angels singing,
Beyond the shadows 
of the tomb;
And all the bells of 
heaven ringing,
While saints are singing, 
""Home, Sweet Home.""

Some day my labors will 
be ended,
And all my wand'rings 
will be o'er,
And all earth's broken ties 
be mended,
And I shall sigh and weep 
no more.

Some day the dark clouds 
will be rifted,
And all the night of gloom 
be past;
And all life's burdens 
will be lifted,
The day of rest shall 
dawn at last."
211;I Shall Not Be Moved;F;"Jesus is my Saviour, 
I shall not be moved;
In His love and favour, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's 
planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

CHORUS
I shall not be, 
I shall not be moved,
I shall not be, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's 
planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In my Christ abiding, 
I shall not be moved;
In His love I'm hiding, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's
planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

If I trust Him ever, 
I shall not be moved:
He will fail me never, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's
planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

On His word I'm feeding, 
I shall not be moved,
He's the One that's leading, 
I shall not be moved,
Just like a tree that's
planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Glory hallelujah, 
I shall not be moved;
Anchored in Jehovah, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's
planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In His love abiding, 
I shall not be moved;
And in Him confiding, 
I shall not be moved:
Just like a tree that's
planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though all hell assail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Jesus will not fail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's
planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though the tempest rages, 
I shall not be moved,
On the Rock of Ages, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's
planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved."
212;I Feel Like Traveling On;F;"My heavenly home 
Is bright and fair,
I feel like traveling on, 
No pain, nor death 
Can enter there,
I feel like traveling on.

Chorus
Yes, I feel like traveling on,
I feel like traveling on;
My heavenly home 
Is bright and fair,
I feel like traveling on.

It's glittering towers 
     the sun outshine,
I feel like traveling on;
That heavenly mansion 
     shall be mine,
I feel like traveling on.

Let others seek a home below,
I feel like traveling on;
Which flames devour, 
Or waves o'er flow,
I feel like traveling on.

The Lord has been so 
     good to me,
I feel like traveling on;
Until that blessed home I see,
I feel like traveling on."
213;I Am Marked;Ab;"I have lost my reputation 
Since I turned my back on sin,
And a lot of friends went from me 
Since I let my Saviour in;
Now they pass me by unknown, 
When they once passed with a smile;
Now they say I'm very foolish, 
And they say I'm out of style.

CHORUS
I am marked, marked, marked,
I am marked, now wherever I go;
I am marked, marked, marked,
Just what I am everyone seems to know.
I am sealed, sealed, sealed,
I am sealed by His Spirit Divine;
Oh glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen!
I am His and I know that He is mine.

Well, they say my life is ruined, 
And my talent thrown away,
And they cannot understand it, 
For I had such plans one day;
But I know what I surrendered 
When I promised I'd go through;
And I gained far more glory 
Since God made me over new."
214;Wings Of A Dove;C;"Noah had drifted
On the floods many days
He searched for land
In various ways
Troubles he had some,
But not from above,
God gave him His sign
On the wings of a dove.

Chorus
On the wings of a snow-white dove,
God sends His pure, sweet love,
A sign from above, 
On the wings of a dove.

Jesus, our Saviour
Came to earth one day;
He was born in a stable,
In a manger of hay;
Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign,
On the wings of a dove.

Though I have suffered
In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;
Faith wasn't forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign
On the wings of a dove.

The bride in her anguish
Is awaiting the claim
Of her Loved One and Saviour
Who is Jesus by Name
Though here rejected
But not from above
God gave her His sign
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a dove."
215;Beyond The Sunset;Db;"Beyond the sunset, 
Oh blissful morning,
When with our Saviour 
Heaven is begun.
Earth's toiling ended, 
Oh glorious dawning;
Beyond the sunset, 
when day is done.

Beyond the sunset 
No clouds will gather,
No storms will threaten, 
No fears annoy.
Oh day of gladness, 
Oh day unending;
Beyond the sunset, eternal joy.

Beyond the sunset, 
A hand will guide me
To God, the Father, 
Whom I adore;
His glorious presence, 
His words of welcome,
Will be my portion 
On that fair shore.

Beyond the sunset, 
Oh glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones 
Who've gone before.
In that fair homeland 
We'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset forevermore."
216;Shall We Gather At The River;C;"Shall we gather at the river, 
Where bright angel feet have trod,
With its crystal tide forever,
Flowing from the throne of God.

CHORUS
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river;
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows from the throne of God.

On the bosom of the river,
Where the Saviour-King we own,
We shall meet and sorrow never,
'Neath the glory of the throne.

On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy, golden day.

Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

At the smiling of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour's face,
Saints whom death will never sever
Lift their songs of saving grace.

Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace."
217;Must Jesus Bear Alone?;G;"Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for every one,
And there's a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I'll bear,
Till death shall set me free,
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there's a crown for me.

Upon the crystal pavement, down
At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,.
And His dear name repeat.

Oh precious cross! Oh glorious crown!
Oh resurrection day!
Ye angels from the stars come down
And bear my soul away."
218;Won't It Be Wonderful?;F;"When with the Saviour 
we enter the gloryland,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Ended the troubles 
and cares of the storyland,
Won't it be wonderful there?

CHORUS
Won't it be wonderful there?
Having no burdens to bear?
Joyously singing 
With heart-bells all ringing,
Oh won't it be wonderful there?

Walking and talking with Christ, 
the supernal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Praising adoring the matchless 
eternal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?

There where the tempest 
Will never be sweeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Sure that forever the Lord 
will be  keeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?"
219;When I Reach That City;F;"On the top of Mount Zion is a city
And the earth with glory it doth fill;
I shall look on its beauty in the 
     morning
When I reach that city on the hill.

CHORUS
Oh, that city on Mount Zion,
Tho' a pilgrim, yet I love thee still;
I'll not leave thee, through the ages,
When I reach that city on the hill.

I'm invited to come home to that city,
For the Word says, ""Whosoever will,""
And I'll find there a mansion for me
     waiting
When I reach that city on the hill.

Death will never molest me in that city,
Never leave me lying cold and chill;
And I'll enter to live up there forever
When I reach that city on the hill.

So I'll stay here until my Saviour 
     calls me,
Trying daily to perform His will;
Then He'll say unto me, ""Well done,""
     up yonder
When I reach that city on the hill."
220;I Am Resolved;Ab;"I am resolved no longer 
   to linger,
Charmed by the world's
     delight;
Things that are higher, 
     things that are nobler,
These have allured my sight.

CHORUS
I will hasten to Him,
Hasten so glad and free,
Jesus, greatest, highest,
I will come to Thee.

I am resolved to go to the 
    Saviour, 
Leaving my sin and strife;
He is the true One, He is
     the just One,
He hath the words of life.

I am resolved to follow    
     the Saviour,
Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He sayeth, 
     do what He willeth,
He is the living way.

I am resolved to enter 
    the kingdom,
Leaving the paths of sin;
Friends may oppose me, 
     foes may beset me
Still will I enter in.

I am resolved, and who will 
     go with me?
Come, friends, without delay,
Taught by the Bible, led by 
     the Spirit,
We'll walk the heavenly way."
221;Jesus Is The One;F;"When the day is dark before you
And the clouds are hanging low,
There's One who watches over you
Everywhere that you may go.

Chorus
Jesus is the one, 
Yes He's the only one,
Let Him have His way 
Until the day is done;
When He speaks, you know 
The clouds will have to go,
Just because He loves you so.

O if you are sad and lonely,
Life is but an empty tomb
Breath a prayer to Jesus only
He will drive away the gloom.

When you come to cross the river,
He will be your Friend and Guide;
You can live with Him forever,
Over on the other side."
222;Open My Eyes, That I May See;Bb;"Open my eyes, 
That I may see
Glimpses of truth 
Thou hast for me;
Place in my hands 
The wonderful key
That shall unclasp, 
And set me free.

CHORUS
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit Divine!

Open my ears, 
That I may hear
Voices of truth 
Thou sendest clear;
And while the wave-notes 
Fall on my ear,
Everything false 
Will disappear,

Open my mouth, 
And let me bear
Gladly the warm 
Truth everywhere;
Open my heart, 
And let me prepare,
Love with Thy children 
Thus to share."
223;The Love Of God;C;"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

CHORUS
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints and angels song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God's love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race,
The saints and angels' song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."
224;The Meeting In The Air;Bb;"You have heard of little Moses in the bulrush,
You have heard of fearless David and his sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming 
     Joseph,
And of Jonah and the whale you often sing.
There are many, many others through the Bible,
I should like to meet them all, I do declare!
By and by the Lord will surely let us meet them,
At the meeting in the air.

CHORUS
There is going to be a meeting in the air.
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you, meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky;
Such singing you will hear, 
Never heard by mortal ear,
'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son will be the leading One
At the meeting in the air.

Many things will there be missing 
In that meeting:
For the mourners bench 
Will have no place at all;
There will never be a sermon 
Preached to sinners,
For the sinner had refused to heed the call.
There will be no mourning 
Over wayward loved ones,
There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer;
All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted
At that meeting in the air.

There the doubters will be missing altogether,
All the skeptics will be absent on that day;
There will be no grumblers present to disturb us,
And the Achans will be busy far away.
There the saints will have His 
     ""seal upon their foreheads,""
Dressed in raiment none 
But ransomed ones can wear;
All who have the wedding garments 
     will be present, 
At the meeting in the air."
225;The Old Time Religion;G;"It's the old-time Holy Spirit,
And the devil won't go near It,
That's the reason people fear It;
But it's good enough for me.

Chorus
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
It's good enough for me.

It will make you stop your lying;
It will save you when you're dying;
It will start the devil flying;
And It's good enough for me.

It's so good I want no other,
For It makes me love my brother;
And It brings things from under 
     cover,
And It's good enough for me.

(It was good in the fiery furnace...)
(It was good for Paul and Silas...)
(It was good for our fathers...)
(It was good for Brother Branham...)
(It was good for Brother Jerry...)
(Makes me love everybody...)
(It will takes us all to Heaven...)"
226;Jesus, The Light;Eb;"All ye saints of light proclaim,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Life and mercy in His name,
Jesus, the light of the world.

CHORUS
We'll walk in the light, 
the beautiful light,
Come where the dewdrops 
of mercy are bright;
Shine all around us 
by day and by night,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Hear the Saviour's earnest call,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Send the Gospel truth to all,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Why not seek Him then today,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Go with truth the narrow way,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Come, confess Him as your King, 
Jesus, the light of the world;
Then the bells of heaven will ring,
Jesus, the light of the world."
227;It's Dripping With Blood;Eb;"The first one to die for 
This Holy Ghost plan,
Was John the Baptist, 
But he died like a man;
Then came the Lord Jesus, 
They crucified Him,
He taught that the Spirit 
Would save men from sin.

CHORUS
It's dripping with blood, Yes, 
It's dripping with blood,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood,
The blood of disciples 
Who died for the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, 
And John the divine,
They gave up their lives so 
This Gospel could shine;
They mingled their blood, 
Like the prophets of old,
So the true Word of God 
Could honest be told.

Then they stoned Stephen, 
He preached against sin,
He made them so angry, 
They dashed his head in;
But he died in the Spirit, 
And gave up the ghost,
And went to join others, 
In that life-giving host.

There's souls under the altar, 
Crying, ""How long?""
For the Lord to punish 
Those who've done wrong;
But there's going to be more 
Who'll give their life's blood
For this Holy Ghost Gospel 
And its crimson flood."
228;Have Thine Own Way, Lord;Eb;"Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Thou are the Potter;
I am the clay.
Mould me and make me
After Thy will,
While I am waiting, 
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me,
Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in thy presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray!
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o'er my being
Absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me."
229;The Homecoming Week;F;"Upon our journey here below 
     we meet with pain and loss;
Sometimes there is a crown of thorns,
     sometimes the heavy cross.
The dreary road to Calvary,
     the bitter goad and sting,
But what's inside those gates of pearl
     will be worth everything.

CHORUS
When we're inside the gates of pearl,
We'll learn a lot of things,
We'll have a harp that's made of gold,
Perhaps a thousand strings;
We'll sing and shout and dance about,
The Lamb will dry our tears;
We'll have a grand homecoming week,
The first ten thousand years.

The shadows now begin to fall,
     the time is drawing nigh,
When Christ our Lord shall come again
     like lightning from the sky.
And while we wait and suffer here, 
     praise God, we'll shout and sing,
For one glimpse through those gates
     of pearl will be worth everything.

The precious blood of God's own Son
     has saved and sanctified
A wondrous people for His name 
     and they are called the Bride.
Though here neglected and despised,
     one day the Lord will bring
His chosen ones within the gates,
     and that's worth everything."
230;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot;F;"I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home;
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

CHORUS
Swing low, sweet chariot, 
Coming for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do,
Coming for to carry me home;
Tell all my friends I'm coming too,
Coming for to carry me home.

The brightest day, that I ever knew,
Coming for to carry me home;
When Jesus washed my sins away,
Coming for to carry me home."
231;Peace In The Valley;C;"Well, I'm tired and so weary, 
But I must go along;
Till the Lord comes and calls 
Me away, oh, yes;
Well the morning is bright 
And the Lamb is the Light;
And the night, night is as fair 
As the day, oh yes.

CHORUS
There will be peace in the valley 
For me some day;
There will be peace in the valley 
For me, oh, Lord, I pray;
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow,
no trouble I'll see;
There will be peace 
In the valley for me.

There the flow'rs will be blooming, 
And the grass will be blue;
And the skies will be clear 
And serene, oh, yes;
Well the Son ever beams, 
In this valley of dreams;
And no clouds there will ever 
Be seen, oh, yes.

Well, the bear will be gentle, 
And the wolf will be tame;
And the lion shall lay down 
By the lamb, oh, yes;
Well the beast from the wild, 
Shall be led by a little child;
And I'll be changed, changed 
From this creature that I am, oh, yes.

No headaches or heartaches
No misunderstanding
No confusion or troubles will be there
No more frowns to defile
Just to be in a smile
There will be peace
And contentment for me"
232;Wonderful;F;"Oh my heart sings today, 
Sings for joy and gladness,
Jesus saves, satisfies, 
Banishes my sadness;
Guilt is gone, peace is mine, 
Peace like to a river,
Jesus is wonderful, 
Mighty to deliver.

CHORUS
Wonderful, wonderful, 
Jesus is to me,
Counselor, Prince of Peace, 
Mighty God is He;
Saving me, keeping me 
From all sin and shame,
Wonderful is my Redeemer, 
Praise His name!

Once a slave, now I'm free, 
Free from condemnation,
Jesus gives liberty 
And a full salvation;
Now the sins of the past 
Have been all forgiven,
And my name is inscribed 
On the book of heaven.

Living here with my Lord 
In a holy union,
Day by day, all the way 
Holding sweet communion;
Oh what change grace hath wrought 
In my lowly station!
Since my soul has received 
Full and free salvation."
234;Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus;F;"O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free!

CHORUS
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of this earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion,
For more than conqu'rors we are!

His Word shall not fail you, 
     He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well;
Then go to a world that is dying, 
His perfect salvation to tell!"
235;A Child Of The King;Eb;"My Father is rich in 
     houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of 
      the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, 
      of silver and gold
His coffers are full, 
     He has riches untold.

CHORUS
I'm a child of the King!
A child of the King!
With Jesus my Saviour,
I'm a child of the King!

My Father's own Son, 
      the Saviour of men,
Once wandered o'er earth 
     as the poorest of  them;
But now He is reigning 
     forever on high,
And will give me a home 
     in heav'n by and by.

I once was an outcast, 
     stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, 
     and an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted, 
     my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, 
     a robe, and a crown.

A tent or a cottage, 
     why should I care?
They're building a palace 
     for me over there!
Though exiled from home, 
     yet still I may sing:
All glory to God, 
     I'm a child of the King!"
236;Battle Hymn Of The Republic;Ab;"Mine eyes have seen the glory
     of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
     of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
     of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
     in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
     by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
     that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
     before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
     be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
     Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
     that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
     let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on."
237;The Unveiled Christ;C;"Once Our blessed Christ of beauty, 
Was veiled off from human view;
But through suff'ring, 
     death and sorrow,
He has rent the veil in two.

CHORUS
Oh behold the man of sorrows,
Oh behold Him in plain view,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Yes, He is with God, the Father,
Interceding there for you;
For He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due,
For He is the well beloved,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Throughout time and endless ages,
Heights and depths of love so true,
He alone can be the giver,
Since He rent the veil in two."
238;Hold To God's Hand;F;"Time is filled with
 swift transition,
Naught of earth
 unmoved can stand,
Build your hopes on
 things eternal,
Hold to God's 
unchanging hand!

CHORUS
Hold to God's 
 unchanging hand!
Hold to God's 
 unchanging hand!
Build your hopes
 on things eternal,
Hold to God's 
 unchanging hand!

Trust in Him who
 will not leave you,
Whatsoever years
 may bring,
If by earthly friends
 forsaken,
Still more closely
 to Him cling!

Covet not this world's
 vain riches,
That so rapidly decay,
Seek to gain the
 heavenly treasures,
They will never pass
 away!

When your journey
 is completed,
If to God you have
 been true,
Fair and bright the
 home in glory,
Your enraptured
 soul will view!"
239;One Day;C;"One day when heaven 
Was filled with His praises,
One day when sin 
Was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth 
To be born of a virgin -
Dwelt amongst men, 
My example is He!

CHORUS
Living, He loved me; 
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried 
My sins far away;
Rising, He justified 
Freely forever:
One day He's coming - 
Oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him 
Up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him 
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, 
Despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins, 
My Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him 
Alone in the garden,
One day He rested, 
From suffering free;
Angels came down 
O'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, 
My Saviour is He!

One day the grave could 
Conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled 
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death 
He had conquered;
Now is ascended, 
My Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will 
Sound for His coming,
One day the skies with 
His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, 
My beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour, 
This Jesus is mine!"
240;The Lifeboat;F;"We're floating down the stream of time,
We have not long to stay;
The stormy clouds of darkness
Will turn to brightest day.
Then let us all take courage,
For we're not left alone;
The lifeboat soon is coming
To gather the Jewels home.

Chorus
Then cheer, my brother, cheer,
Our trials will soon be o'er,
Our loved ones we shall meet, shall meet,
Upon the golden shore.
We're pilgrims and we're strangers here,
We're seeking a city to come,
The lifeboat soon is coming,
To gather the Jewels home.

Sometimes the Devil tempts me,
And says it's all in vain
To try to live a Christian life
And walk in Jesus' name;
But then we hear the Master say,
""I'll lend you a helping hand,
And if you'll only trust Me,
I'll guide you to the land.""

The lifeboat soon is coming,
By eyes of faith I see
As she sweeps through the waters
To rescue you and me,
And land us safely in the port
With friends we love so dear.
""Get ready,"" cries the Captain;
""Oh, look, she's almost here.""

Oh, now's the time to get on board,
While she is passing by;
But if you stand and wait too long, 
You shall forever die;
The fare is paid for one and all,
The Captain bids you come,
And get on board the lifeboat,
She'll carry you safely home."
241;Down From His Glory;Eb;"Down from His glory, 
Ever living story,
My God and Saviour came, 
And Jesus was His Name.
Born in a manger, 
To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, 
Tears and agony.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Him!  
How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, 
My all in all!
The great Creator 
Became my Saviour,
And all God's fullness 
Dwelleth in Him.

What condescension, 
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night, 
Not one faint hope in sight;
God, gracious, tender, 
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, 
To save my soul.

Without reluctance, 
Flesh and blood His substance,
He took the form of man, 
Revealed the hidden plan.
Oh glorious mystery, 
Sacrifice of Calvary,
And now I know 
Thou art  the great ""I Am."""
242;How Great Thou Art;Ab;"Oh Lord my God!  
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds 
Thy hands have made;
I see the stars, 
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy pow'r throughout 
The universe displayed.

CHORUS
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great
    Thou art!"
243;Leave It There;F;"If the world from you withholds 
Of its silver and its gold,
And you have to get along 
With meager fare,
Just remember, in His Word, 
How He feeds the little bird;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

CHORUS
Leave it there, leave it there,
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there;
If you trust and never doubt,
He will surely bring you out;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

If your body suffers pain 
And your health you can't regain,
And your soul is 
Almost sinking in despair,
Jesus knows the pain you feel,
He can save and He can heal;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your enemies assail
And your heart begins to fail,
Don't forget that God 
In heaven answers prayer;
He will make a way for you 
And will lead you safely through;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your youthful days are gone
And old age is stealing on,
And your body bends 
Beneath the weight of care;
He will never leave you then,
He'll go with you to the end;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there."
244;What A Day That Will Be;F;"There is coming a day 
When no heartaches shall come,
No more clouds in the sky, 
No more tears to dim the eye;
All is peace forevermore 
On that happy golden shore,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

CHORUS
What a day that will be
When my Jesus I shall see,
When I look upon His face, 
The One who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand,
And leads me through 
The Promised Land,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

There'll be no sorrow there, 
No more burdens to bear,
No more sickness, no pain, 
No more parting over there;
And forever I will be 
With the One who died for me,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be."
245;Nothing Between;F;"Nothing between my soul
and the Saviour,
Naught of this world's
delusive dream:
I have renounced all
sinful pleasure,
Jesus is mine, there's
nothing between.

CHORUS
Nothing between my soul
and the Saviour,
So that His blessed face
may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least
of His favour,
Keep the way clear!
Let nothing between.

Nothing between like
worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless
they seem,
Must not my heart from Him
ever sever;
He is my all, there's nothing
between.

Nothing between, like pride
or station;
Self or friends shall not
intervene;
Though it may cost me
much tribulation,
I am resolved, there's nothing
between.

Nothing between, e'en many
hard trials,
Though the whole world
against me convene;
Watching with prayer and
much self-denial,
I'll triumph at last, with nothing
between."
246;In Times Like These;F;"In times like these you need a Saviour,
In times like these you need an anchor
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

CHORUS
This rock is Jesus, Yes, He's the One,
This rock is Jesus, the only One;
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these you need the Bible,
In times like these oh be not idle,
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these, I have a Saviour,
In times like these, I have an anchor,
I'm very sure, I'm very sure,
My anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock."
247;He Abides;F;"I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the pilgrim way,
For the hand of God 
 in all my life I see,
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter 
  abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, He abides,
 Hallelujah, 
He abides with me
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter 
  abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus 
  died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care
I'm as happy as a bird 
 and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter 
 abides with me!

There's no thirsting for the things
Of the world, they've taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, 
 and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter 
 abides with me!"
248;That Man From Galilee;Eb;"In a manger long ago, 
I know it's really so,
A Babe was born 
To save men from their sin.
John saw Him on the shore, 
The Lamb forevermore,
Oh, the Christ, 
The Crucified of Calvary.

CHORUS
Oh I love that Man from Galilee,
For He's done so very much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins, 
Placed the Holy Ghost within;
Oh I love that man 
     from Galilee.

The publican went to pray 
In the temple there one day,
He cried, ""O Lord 
     be merciful to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this Man 
     from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk, 
The dumb was made to talk,
That power was spoken with 
Love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man 
     from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of Man 
What must he do.
These words He said to him, 
""Ye must be born again,""
By the Spirit of that Man 
     from Galilee.

The woman at the well, 
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands 
She had at that time,
She was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that 
     Man from Galilee!"""
249;Then Jesus Came;C;"One sat alone beside
the highway begging,
His eyes were blind, 
the light he could not see;
He clutched his rags and 
shivered in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and 
bade his darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the tempter's 
power is broken;
When Jesus comes, 
the tears are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the 
life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus 
comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil 
spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
He cut himself as demon pow'rs 
possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the 
captive free.

Unclean! unclean! 
The leper cried in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, 
in helplessness stood near;
The fever raged, disease 
had gripped its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast 
out every fear.

So men today have found the 
Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion, 
lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them sad 
and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt 
Himself within."
250;Such Love;F;"That God should love 
A sinner such as I,
Should yearn to change
My sorrow into bliss,
Nor rest till He 
Had planned to bring me nigh,
How wonderful is love like this!

CHORUS
Such love, such wondrous love,
Such love, such wondrous love,
That God should love 
A sinner such as I,
How wonderful is love like this!

That Christ should join 
So freely in the scheme,
Although it meant 
His death on Calvary,
Did ever human tongue 
Find nobler theme
Than love divine 
That ransomed me?

That for a wilful 
Outcast such as I,
The Father planned, 
The Saviour bled and died;
Redemption for 
A worthless slave to buy,
Who long had law 
And grace defied.

And now He takes me 
To His heart, a son,
He asks me not 
To fill a servant's place;
The ""far-off country"" 
Wand'rings all are done,
Wide open are 
His arms of grace."
251;When The Saints March In;Eb;"I'm a pilgrim and a stranger
Wand'ring through this world of sin,
On my way to that fair city,
When the Saints go marching in.

Chorus
When the Saints go marching in,
When the Saints go marching in,
Lord, I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in.
(...When they crown Him King of kings)

Oh, I know I'll see my Saviour 
If my life is free from sin,
Heaven's doors will open for me
When the Saints go marching in.

When we gather 'round the Throne
And the gates are closed within,
I'll be shouting ""Glory, Glory""
When the Saints go marching in.

I'm waiting for the chariot
To swing low and I'll step in,
On the clouds I'll ride to Heaven
When the Saints go marching in.

Kana vakundi vopinda
Kana vakundi vopinda
She ndinoda kuva mumwe
Kana vakundi vopinda"
252;The Day Of Redemption;F;"Nations are breaking, 
Israel's awaking,
The signs that the prophets 
     foretold;
The Gentile days numbered, 
With horrors encumbered;
Eternity soon will unfold.

CHORUS
The day of Redemption is here,
Men's hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Your lamps trimmed and clear,
Look up! Your Redemption is here.

The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem's restoring
Her national life, long dethroned;
Today she is calling, 
Her latter rain's falling,
""Return, Oh dispersed, to your own.""

Heaven's powers are shaking, 
And many are mistaking
God's meaning to be of the sky;
God's Church is the power
That's shaking this hour:
The day of Redemption is nigh.

False prophets are lying, 
God's Truth they're denying,
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generation 
Spurns God's revelation,
We'll walk where the apostles 
     have trod."
253;Oh My Loving Brother;F;"Oh the judgment day is coming
What an awful day 'twill be,
Christ forever is my refuge
Rock of Ages cleft for me.

CHORUS
Oh, my loving brother,
When the world's on fire,
Don't you want God's bosom
To be your pillow,
Hide me over in the Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages cleft for me.

At the sounding of the trumpet,
At the dawning of the day,
Worldly pleasures with their treasures,
Shall forever pass away.

Poor lost sinners will be crying,
For the Home they'll never see,
But the ransomed will be singing
Rock of Ages, cleft for me."
254;Lights Of That City;F;"John tells of a city, 
That he saw coming down,
Where no sorrow or death will be known,
That someday we could go there
Through His marvelous grace,
Forever live in that heavenly home.

CHORUS
I can almost see the lights of that city,
I see them gathering, all around
The great white throne;
With faith in my Saviour,
And His wonderful love,
Oh, I can almost see the lights of home.

And sometimes when I'm burdened,
And my cross seems hard to bear.
And old Satan, he tries to dim my view,
Well I just look unto Jesus,
He is standing close by,
Then once again, 
His great light shines through."
255;I'm Looking For A City;F;"I'm looking for a city,
The one not made by hands,
I'm looking over Jordan,
I see the promised land,
The waters will be parted
And I'll be on my way,
As we're crossing over Jordan 
I can say:

CHORUS
Now I have that everlasting joy within,
Since He came and took away my sin,
The moment that He blessed me,
He made me fully whole,
With that everlasting joy 
Within my soul.

I'm drinking from the fountain
That floweth from on high,
A well of blessed waters
That never shall run dry,
I'm feasting on God's manna,
I'm praying day by day,
And that everlasting joy 
Is here to stay.

I've heard the prophet's message, 
I've placed it in my heart,
I've got the revelation 
That never shall depart,
The Rapture is upon us,
The stage is set to go.
We have this precious promise 
We all know."
256;All That Thrills My Soul;Bb;"Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
By His presence all divine?
True and Tender, pure and precious,
Oh how blest to call Him mine!

CHORUS
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me;
And the fairest of ten thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.

Love of Christ so freely given,
Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea.

What a wonderful redemption!
Never can a mortal know
How my sin, tho' red like crimson,
Can be whiter than the snow.

Every need His hand supplying,
Every good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying,
He is all in all to me.

By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King."
257;Come And Go With Me;F;"Come and go with me
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House.
Come and go with me,
To my Father's House,
Where There's peace, peace, peace.

Jesus will be there
In my Father's House
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House.
Jesus will be there
In my Father's House,
Where there's peace, peace, peace.

There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House, 
In my Father's House.
There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House.
There'll be joy, real joy."
258;I'll Fly Away;G;"Some glad morning 
When this life is o'er
I'll fly away,
To a home on God's 
     celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away, oh glory, 
I'll fly away;
Before I die, 
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows 
Of this life have grown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird from prison 
     bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more 
Weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys 
     shall never end,
I'll fly away."
259;It Is Love - Oh The Precious Love Of Jesus;F;"There is something in my soul 
Which keeps the shadows all away;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something lightens ev'ry burden,
Gives me gladness day by day,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

CHORUS
Oh the precious love of Jesus,
How it thrills my ransomed soul!
More and more I'll sing its praises
While the happy ages roll.

When the tempter tries to win me
Something keeps me true and strong;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something makes my life a blessing
To the needy in the throng,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

When misfortune overtakes me
Something calms my troubled breast;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something draws my soul to heaven,
That sweet land of peace and rest.
It is love, my Saviour's love.

Soul astray and bowed in sorrow,
Something waits for you today;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
It would give you peace and comfort,
Make your burdens roll away,
It is love, my Saviour's love."
260;My Sins Are Gone;Eb;"You ask me why I'm happy
So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;
And when I meet the scoffers
Who ask me where they are,
I say, my sins are gone.

CHORUS
They're underneath the Blood,
Of the Cross of Calvary,
As far removed as darkness 
     is from dawn;
In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
That's good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me 
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

I'm living now for Jesus,
I'm happy night and day,
Because my sins are gone;
My soul is filled with music,
With all my heart I say,
I know my sins are gone."
261;He Set Me Free;F;"Once like a bird 
In prison I dwelt.
No freedom from 
My sorrow I felt.
Then Jesus came 
And listened to me,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

CHORUS
He set me free, 
Yes, He set me free.
He broke the bonds 
Of prison for me.
I'm glory bound 
My Jesus to see,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

Now I am climbing 
Higher each day,
Darkness of night 
Has drifted away.
My feet are planted 
On higher ground,
Glory to God, 
I'm homeward bound.

Good-bye to sin 
And things that confound,
Naught of this world 
Shall turn me around,
Daily I'm working, 
I'm praying too,
Glory to God, 
I'm going through."
262;The Great Emancipator;Ab;"Once my heart and soul were fettered
By the binding chains of sin.
But the Great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Blessed be His holy name!
He's the Great Emancipator,
That's the song of the Redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting
Oh so helpless and alone, 
But the seeking Shepherd found me,
Led me to my Father's home."
263;The Original Life;Ab;"God's attributes were manifested
To His Bride in this last age.
We have caught the revelation
By the last prophet's message.
And we know who we are
And what we are raised up for,
Praise the Lord, for the Original Life.

CHORUS
The Original Life, the Original Seed
The Original Word is what I believe.
The Son of Man is revealed
The seventh seal is unveiled
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say.
And our names are seen within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin.
Yes, we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who's the Original Life.

Our eyes of understanding
He has opened up at last.
And sweet victory is ours
Who were chained down in the past.
True Jubilee has sounded
And we have responded
To our God, Who's the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power.
Sleeping saints will wake and join us
For translation in this hour.
Gentiles' days will soon be over
Glory, hallelujah!
To our God, Who's the Original Life."
264;All In All;F;"Of Jesus love I'm singing
I praise Him every day;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He frees my soul from bondage,
He takes my guilt away;
Jesus is my All in All.

CHORUS
All in All, All in All,
A strength in time of weariness
A light when shadows fall.
All in All, All in All,
Jesus is my All in All.

He's patient and so tender,
So loving and so kind;
He is my All in All, All in All.
Another Friend so faithful
My soul will never find;
Jesus is my All in All.

In time of need no other
To me can prove so dear;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He hears me tho' I whisper,
To help me he is near;
Jesus is my All in All."
265;More About Jesus;F;"More about Jesus I would know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

CHORUS
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus in His Word, 
Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace."
266;Psalm 19;Eb;"The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure,
Making wise the simple.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The statutes of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure,
Enlightening the eyes.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.
And in the keeping of them
There is great reward,
There is great reward.
In the keeping of them
There is great reward."
267;The Church's One Foundation;C;"The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord:
She is His new creation
By water and the Word.
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth,
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping
Their cry goes up, ""How long?""
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song.

Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore.
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the church at rest."
268;His Banner Over Me Is Love;F;"He  brought me to 
His banqueting table
His banner over me is love;
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

He set straight paths 
before my feet
His banner over me is love,
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

He broke the chains 
and He set me free
His banner over me is love
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

I am my Beloved's 
and He is mine
His banner over me is love,
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love."
269;Deeper In That Holy Life;F;"Deeper In Thy love, Oh Jesus
Doth my spirit cry to go.
Until all my life is hidden 
Deep within the cleansing flow.

CHORUS
Deeper in that holy life
'Til I'm lost with Christ in God.
Hidden with my blessed Lord
While I walk this earthly sod.

Humbly must I walk with Jesus
In the paths that He doth lead.
Never falter, never murmur
Always to His voice give heed.

Daily must I seek to please Him
Whether it bring joy or pain.
I shall know then just how blessed
Is the worth of Heav'nly gain.

Deeper, 'til at last in Glory
In His likeness I shall come.
Where the saints of all the ages
Shall receive their welcome home."
270;We Are Heirs;Ab;"We are heirs of the Father
We are joint-heirs with the Son.
We are people of His Kingdom
We are family, we are one.

We are washed,
We are sanctified.
We are cleansed by His blood.
We are born of the Spirit
We are children of the Lord.

We are members of His body.
We are objects of His love.
We're partakers of His holiness
We are citizens of heaven above.

We're partakers of His suffering;
We're partakers of His grace.
We shall meet Him to be like Him
We shall see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming
We are looking to the skies;
We are watching, we are waiting,
We shall dwell with Him, we 
    shall rise.

We shall reign with Him forever;
Men and angels shout and sing.
For dominion has been given
To the family of the King."
271;He's The Lord Of Glory;Eb;"Behold what manner of man is this,
Who stills the raging sea.
He heals the sick, the lame, the halt,
And makes the blind to see.
He opens all the prison doors
And sets the captives free.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

CHORUS
He's the Lord of glory
He is the great ""I Am""
The Alpha and Omega,
The beginning and the end.
His name is Wonderful
The Prince of Peace is He
He's the everlasting Father
Throughout eternity.

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who spake to the woman at the well.
Everlasting life I will give to thee,
Far richer than man can tell
And whosoever shall drink of the well
Shall live eternally.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who speaks to the lame and halt.
He says ""Thy sins be forgiven thee,
Take up thy bed and walk""
He stands as the mighty healer now
And cries ""Come unto me""
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this
Who stands between God and man.
His eyes are as a flame of fire
His fan is in His hand.
John saw Him in the seven churches
As the sun in brilliancy
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who sits on His heavenly throne.
He rules and reigns from heaven above
His beloved and His own.
He's the lion of the tribe of Judah,
The root of David is He.
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?"
272;He Touched Me;Eb;"Shackled by a heavy burden
'Neath a load of guilt and shame,
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same.

CHORUS
He touched me,
Oh, He touched me,
And oh, the joy 
That floods my soul!
Something happened, 
And now I know,
He touched me, 
And made me whole.

Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed 
And made me whole,
I shall never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls."
273;This World Is Not My Home;F;"This world is not my home
I'm just a'passing through
My treasures are laid up 
Somewhere beyond the blue.
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

CHORUS
Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

They're all expecting me
And that's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus
Many years ago.
I know He'll see me through
Tho' I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Just over in the gloryland,
We'll live eternally;
The saints on every hand
Are shouting ""victory"".
The songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore."
274;Lead Me To Calvary;Eb;"King of my life I crown Thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned 
brow,
Lead me to Calvary.

Chorus
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony,
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou 
wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept:
Angels in robes of light arrayed,
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me, like Mary, through 
the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee:
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear,
Daily my cross for Thee:
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Fill me, Oh Lord, with Thy desire,
For all who know not Thee:
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
To speak of Calvary."
275;I Don't Know What I'd Do;F;"I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord;
When I look around and see,
All that He has done for me,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord.

Without Him I can do nothing
Without Him, I'd surely fail;
Without Him, I would be drifting
Like a ship without a sail.

So I'll ask Him to be my Pilot, 
His Word my compass and guide.
Till I've anchored safely in glory,
For without Him I'd drift with the tide.

Jesus, my Jesus
Do you know Him today?
Please don't turn Him away, Oh
Jesus, my Jesus,
Without Him how lost I would be."
276;Whisper A Prayer;F;"Whisper a prayer in the morning,
Whisper a prayer at noon,
Whisper a prayer in the evening,
To keep your heart in tune.

God answers prayer in the morning,
God answers prayer at noon,
God answers prayer in the evening,
So keep your heart in tune.

Jesus may come in the morning,
Jesus may come at noon,
Jesus may come in the evening,
So keep your heart in tune."
277;It Is Well With My Soul;C;"When peace like a river
Attendeth my way,
When sorrows, 
Like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, 
Thou hast taught me to say,
""It is well, it is well with my soul.""

Chorus
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well 
With my soul.

Tho' Satan should buffet,
Tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control.
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood
for my soul.

My sin - oh, the bliss 
Of this glorious thought -
My sin - not in part, 
But the whole
Is nailed to the cross;
And I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Oh my soul.

And Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight.
The clouds be rolled back 
as a scroll.
The trump shall resound, 
And the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee,
For Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, 
is our goal;
Oh, the shout of the angel!
Oh, the voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope!
Blessed rest of my soul!

278;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God;C;"A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe -
His craft and pow'r are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He -
Lord Sabaoth His name,
From age to age the same -
And He must win the battle.

And tho this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us.
The Prince of darkness grim - 
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! His doom is sure -
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow'rs -
No thanks to them - abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still -
His kingdom is forever."

280;Arise, My Soul, Arise;Ab;"Arise, my soul, arise;
Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding sacrifice
    in my behalf appears:
Before the throne my surety stands,
Before the throne my surety stands,
My name is written on His hands.

He ever lives above, 
For me to intercede;
His all redeeming love, 
His precious blood, to plead:
His blood atoned for all our race,
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

Five bleeding wounds He bears;
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers; 
They strongly plead for me:
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Nor let that ransomed sinner die!""

The Father hears Him pray,
His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away, 
The presence of His Son;
His Spirit answers to the blood,
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.

My God is reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear:
With confidence I now draw nigh,
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And ""Father, Abba, Father,"" cry."
281;His Way With Thee;F;"Would you live for Jesus and 
     be always pure and good?
Would you walk with Him 
     within the narrow road?
Would you have Him bear your 
     burden, carry all your load?
Let Him have His way with thee.

CHORUS
His pow'r can make you what you
     ought to be,
His blood can cleanse your heart
     and make you free:
His love can fill your soul,
And you will see 'twas best for Him
To have His way with Thee.

Would you have Him make you free, 
     and follow at His call?
Would you know the peace that
     comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you,
     so that you need never fall?
Let Him have His way with Thee.

Would you in His kingdom find
     a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true
     in providential test?
Would you in His service labour
     always at your best?
Let Him have His way with Thee."
282;I'm Longing For Jesus To Come;F;"I'm longing for that glorious day
When Jesus shall come back,
I long to see His blessed face.
When all the saints 
Throughout the ages
Shall be gathered home
The ones who trusted in His grace

CHORUS
I'm longing for Jesus to come back
I long for Jesus Christ my King
To come and take me
To my home beyond the skies,
Up there where angels shout and sing.

Sometimes the road 
Seems rough and hard,
The pathway seems so long,
But He is ever by my side.
He whispers loving words to me
And tells me to be strong,
That He will always lead and guide."
283;Thank God I Am Free;G;"For a long time I travelled
Down a long lonely road;
My heart was so heavy in sin I sank low.
Then I heard about Jesus,
What a wonderful hour;
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out
Through His saving power.

CHORUS
Thank God I am free, free, free
From this world of sin.
Been washed in the blood of Jesus,
I've been born again.
Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved
By His wonderful grace.
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out 
And show me the way.

Like a bird out of prison
That's taken its flight;
Like a blind man that God 
Gave back  his sight.
Like a poor wretched beggar
That's found fortune and fame,
I'm so glad that I found out 
He could bring me out
Thro' His Holy name."
284;Land Of Milk And Honey;G;"There is a land of milk and honey
There is a land
Where we won't need money.
There is a land 
Shining with jasper.
There we shall see 
Our blessed Saviour.

CHORUS
And that's the reason
We shout ""Hallelujah""
Praising our King across the river.
That shining river
Where the saints will gather
There we shall see 
Our blessed Messiah.

Elijah has come, 
He has done his work already
As John has said, 
The Bride has made ready.
And now we are waiting 
For the coming of Jesus.
For that blessed day
When the Lamb shall take us.

Our hopes are bright, 
Our lamps are burning.
And day by day 
Our hearts are yearning.
This is the evening
He will come in the morning.
Then we shall wait 
Until the morning."
285;He Paid A Debt;C;"He paid a debt He did not owe,
I owed a debt I could not pay,
I needed someone to wash 
my sins away;
And now I sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay.

He paid a debt at Calvary,
He cleansed my soul and 
set me free,
I'm glad that Jesus did all 
my sins erase.
I now can sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay.

One day He's coming back for me,
To live with Him eternally,
Won't it be glory to see Him 
on that day!
I then will sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay."
286;Until Then;Ab;"My heart can sing 
When I pause to remember,
A heartache here  
Is but a stepping stone,
Along the trail 
That's winding always upward,
This troubled world 
Is not my final home.

CHORUS
But until then, 
My heart will go on singing,
Until then, 
With joy I'll carry on.
Until the day 
Mine eyes behold the city
Until the day 
God calls me home.

The things of earth 
Will dim and lose their value,
If we recall, 
They're borrowed for a while
And things of earth 
That cause the heart to tremble
Remember they 
Will only bring a smile.

This weary world 
With all its toil and struggle,
May take its toll 
Of misery and strife,
The soul of man 
Is like a waiting eagle
When it's released 
It's destined for the sky."
287;This Is Like Heaven To Me;G;"We find many people 
Who can't understand
Why we are so happy and free,
We've crossed over Jordan

Oh this is like heaven to me,
Yes, this is like heaven to me

I've crossed over Jordan 
To Canaan's fair land,
And this is like heaven to me.

Oh,  when I get happy 
I sing and I shout,

But I'm filled with the Spirit, 
There isn't a doubt,
And that's what's the matter with me.

From the creature
That I once was,
And redeemed is now my name.

CHORUS
I've been changed, 
I've been reborn,
All my life has been rearranged;
What a difference it makes
When the Lord has His way
All my life praise God, 
Has been changed.

Tho' my sins were as scarlet
They're white as snow,
I was bound but today I am free;
I was lost in the darkness
But now I'm found,
I was blind but now I see.

When at last in His presence
I stand above,
He will wipe every tear 
From my eyes;
And I'll thank Him for giving 
A wretch like me,
A new home beyond the sky."
289;I'm In That Number;Ab;"I'm in that number, I'm in that number,
I'm in that number robed in white;

290;Let Go Of The Old;Eb;"Let, let go of the old,
And lay, lay hold on the new,
In laying it down a new life is found
There a new life waits for you.

Cast your bread upon the waters
After many days it shall return.
If you pour out your soul
Not a part, but the whole
A new life is there for you.

In saving your life, you will lose it,
But by losing it, you will find it,
Down in the ground 
That's where death is found,
Death that brings life anew."

To purchase my redemption
He hung upon a tree.

My Jesus crucified.

They mocked Him 
And they scoffed Him,
With thorns they crowned His head,
As a lamb unto the slaughter
My Saviour! -  He was led.
The soldier's cruel dagger 
Was thrust into His side,
Oh what a sight for sinners,
My Saviour crucified.

I have a risen Saviour,
He means so much to me.

And in His Word abide.

Threw His loving arms around me, 
Drew me back into the way.

Sight was gone, 
And fears possessed me,

This hidden stream flows on;
My weary soul no longer thirsts,
Nor am I sad and lone.

I cannot tell the half of love,
Unfeigned, supreme, divine,
That caused my darkest in-most self
With beams of hope to shine.

To suffer and to die,
But if I suffer here with Him
I'll reign with Him on high."

     a courage bold,
I stood upon His word.

And would not hear my prayer,
But, praise the Lord! 
The work is done
And Christ the Lord is here."

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne."

And wiser, blessed Lord,
In Thy precious, holy Word.

Deeper, deeper!  
Blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is 
Wholly lost in Jesus,
And His perfect will.

Deeper, deeper! 
Though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the 
Holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

Every day in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqueror, 
And in His own image
Perfected at last."

By trusting in His grace;
'Tis thro His blest atonement,  
That I may see His face.

He brings me through affliction,  
He leaves me not alone;
He's with me in temptation, 
He keeps me for His own.

He prospers and protects me,  
His blessings ever flow;
He fills me with His glory, 
He makes me white as snow.

He keeps me firm and faithful,  
His love I do enjoy,
For this I shall be grateful,
And live in His employ.

There's not a single blessing  
Which we receive on earth
That does not come from heaven,  
The source of our new birth."

Oh Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.
As on Thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory-shore,
My heav'n, my home forevermore!

My Saviour comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by the hand, 
For this is heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from eververnal trees,
And flow'rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody.
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song."
324;A Shelter In The Time Of Storm;F;"The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever ill be tide,
A shelter in the time of storm.

CHORUS
Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land,
A weary land, A weary land;
Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land -
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shade by day, defense by night,
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes afright,
A shelter in the time of storm.

The raging storms may round us beat,
A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.

Oh Rock divine, Oh Refuge dear,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our Helper ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm."
325;The Haven Of Rest;F;"My soul in sad exile 
Was out on life's sea,
So burdened with sin 
     and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice 
Saying, ""Make me your choice;""
And I entered the Haven of Rest.

CHORUS
I've anchored my soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
I'll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep 
O'er the wild, stormy deep;
In Jesus I'm safe evermore.

I yielded myself 
To his tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, 
And I anchored my soul;
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, 
Since the Lord made me whole,    
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus who'll save 
Whosoever will have
A home in the Haven of Rest.

How precious the thought 
That we all may recline,
Like John the beloved and blest,
On Jesus' strong arm 
Where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the Haven of Rest.

Oh come to the Saviour, 
He patiently waits,
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
And say, ""My Beloved is mine."""
326;There Is A Fountain Filled With Blood;Bb;"There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more,
Be saved, to sin no more,
Be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till my change,
And shall be till my change,
And shall be till my change,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till my change.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Sings praises to my King
Sings praises to my King,
Sings praises to my King,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Sings praises to my King."
327;Standing On The Promises;Ab;"Standing on the promises 
Of Christ my King,
Through eternal ages
Let His praises ring;
Glory in the highest 
I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.

CHORUS
Standing, standing, 
Standing on the promises 
Of God, my Saviour;
Standing, standing, 
I'm standing on 
The promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
That cannot fail,
When the howling storms 
Of doubt and fear assail,
By the living Word of God 
I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I now can see
Perfect, present cleansing 
In the blood for me;
Standing in the liberty 
Where Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
Of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally 
By love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily 
With the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I cannot fall,
Listening every moment 
To the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Saviour 
As my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God."
328;How Firm A Foundation;G;"How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said, 
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled?
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, I will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee and cause thee
     to stand,
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for  repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor
     to shake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"
329;Alone With God;F;"When storms of life are round 
     me beating.
When rough the path that I have trod,
Within my closet door retreating,
I love to be alone with God.

Chorus
Alone with God, the world forbidden.
Alone with God, Oh blest retreat!
Alone with God and in Him hidden,
To hold with Him communion sweet.

What tho' the clouds have 
    gathered o'er me?
What tho' I've passed beneath the rod?
God's perfect will there lies before me,
When I am thus alone with God.

'Tis there I find new strength for duty,
As o'er the sands of time I plod;
I see the King in all His beauty.
While resting there alone with God.

And when I see the moment nearing
When I shall sleep beneath the sod,
When time with me is disappearing,
I want to be alone with God."
330;Marching On;C;"Marching on in the light of God,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Up the path that the Master trod, 
Marching, marching on.

Chorus
A robe of white, a crown of gold,
A harp, a home, a mansion fair,
A victor's palm, a joy untold,
Are mine when I get there.

Marching on thro' the hosts of sin, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Vict'ry's mine, while I've Christ within,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on while the skeptics sneer, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Perfect love casteth out all fear,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on with the flag unfurled,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Preaching Christ to the dying world,
Marching, marching on."
331;Praise The Lord;Ab;"To God be the glory, 
Great things He hath done,
So loved He the world that 
He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life 
An atonement for sin,
And opened the Life Gate 
That all may go in.

CHORUS
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, 
Through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; 
Great things He hath done.

Oh, perfect redemption, 
The purchase of blood,
To every believer 
The promise of God;
The vilest offender 
Who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus 
A pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing 
Through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, 
And greater will be
Our wonder, our transport 
When Jesus we see."
332;Oh To Be Like Thee;C;"Oh to be like Thee, 
Blessed Redeemer,
This is my constant 
Longing and prayer;
Gladly I'll forfeit,
All of earth's treasures,
Jesus, Thy perfect 
Likeness to wear.

CHORUS
Oh to be like Thee,
Oh to be like Thee,
Blessed Redeemer, 
Pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, 
Come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image 
Deep on my heart.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Full of compassion,
Loving, forgiving, 
Tender and kind,
Helping the helpless, 
Cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wandering 
Sinner to find.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless, 
Patient and brave;
Meekly enduring 
Cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer, 
Others to save.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lord, I am coming,
Now to receive 
Th' anointing divine,
All that I am and have 
I am bringing,
Lord, from this moment 
All shall be Thine.

Oh to be like Thee, 
While I am pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit, 
Fill with Thy love,
Make me a temple 
Meet for Thy dwelling,
Fit me for life 
And heaven above."
333;Count Your Blessings;C;"When upon life's billows 
You are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged, 
Thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you 
What the Lord hath done.

CHORUS
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Count your blessings,
See what God hath done;
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Then you'll be surprised,
See what God hath done.

Are you ever burdened 
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing 
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think what Christ has promised 
You His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings, 
Money cannot buy
Your reward in Heaven, 
Nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict, 
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, 
God is over all;
Count your many blessings, 
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you 
To your journey's end."
334;What A Friend;F;"What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there."
335;I Will Praise Him;C;"When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing,
When He said, Wilt thou be clean?

CHORUS
I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His blood has washed away 
     each stain.

Though the way seems straight 
     and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him,
Glory, glory to His name!

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in;
He's forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin."
336;Ho! Everyone That Is Thirsty;F;"Ho! ev'ry one that is thirsty in spirit,
Ho! ev'ry one that is weary and sad,
Come to the fountain, 
There's fullness in Jesus,
All that you're longing for, 
Come and be glad.

Chorus
""I will pour water on him 
    who is thirsty, 
I will pour floods upon 
     the dry ground;
Open your heart 
For the gift I am bringing,
While ye are seeking Me, 
I will be found.""

Child of the world, 
Are you tired of your bondage?
Weary of earth-joys,
So false, so untrue;
Thirsting for God, 
And his fullness of blessing?
List to the promise -- 
A message for you.

Child of the kingdom, 
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Nothing but fullness 
Thy longing can meet.
'Tis the enduement 
For life and for service;
Thine is the promise, 
So certain, so sweet."
337;Feasting With My Lord;F;"Since my soul is saved 
     and sanctified,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
In this land of Canaan I'll abide,
Feasting with my Lord.

CHORUS
Feasting, I am feasting,
Feasting with my Lord;
Feasting, I am feasting
On the living Word.

Feeding on the honey 
     and the wine,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Gathering the clusters 
     from the vine,
Feasting with my Lord.

Day by day we have 
     a new supply,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
And the food is never 
     stale nor dry,
Feasting with my Lord.

Many times we have 
     an extra spread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Then to deeper truths 
     I have been led,
Feasting with my Lord.

Often there are only 
     just us two,
Feasting I'm feasting
Then He tells me what 
     He'd have me do,
Feasting with my Lord.

If perchance the cupboard's
     scarce of bread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
On the hidden manna 
      I am fed,
Feasting with my Lord."
338;Oh Say, But I'm Glad;C;"There is a song in my heart today,
Something I never had;
Jesus has taken my sins away,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

CHORUS
Oh say, but I'm glad, I'm glad,
Oh say, but I'm glad;
Jesus has come 
And my cup's overrun;
Oh say but I'm glad.

Wonderful, marvelous 
Love He brings,
Into a heart that's sad;
Through darkest tunnels 
The soul just sings,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

We have a fellowship 
Rich and sweet,
Tongues can never relate;
Abiding in Him is a real treat,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

Won't you come to Him 
With all your care,
Weary and worn and sad?
You too, will sing 
As His love you share.
Oh say, but I'm glad."
339;The Comforter Has Come;C;"O spread the tidings 'round,
wherever man is found,
Wherever human hearts
and human woes abound;
Let ev'ry Christian tongue
proclaim the joyful sound:
The Comforter has come!

Chorus
The Comforter has come, 
The Comforter has come!
The Holy Ghost from Heav'n, 
The Father's promise giv'n;
O spread the tidings 'round, 
wherever man is found 
The Comforter has come!

The long, long night is past, 
the morning breaks at last,
And hushed the dreadful wail 
and fury of the blast,
As o'er the golden hills 
the day advances fast!
The Comforter has come!

Lo, the great King of kings,
with healing in His wings,
To ev'ry captive soul 
a full deliv'rance brings;
And thro' the vacant cells
the song of triumph rings;
The Comforter has come!

O boundless love divine! 
how shall this tongue of mine 
To wond'ring mortals tell
the matchless grace divine
That I, a child of hell,
should in His image shine!
The Comforter has come!"
340;Trust And Obey;F;"When we walk with the Lord
In the Light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

CHORUS
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt nor a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown nor a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey."
341;The Breaking Of The Day;Eb;"'Tis almost time for the Lord to come, 
I hear the people say;
The stars of heav'n are growing dim:
It must be the breaking of the day.

Chorus
O, it must be the breaking of the day,
O, it must be the breaking of the day;
The night is almost gone,
The day is coming on:
O, it must be the breaking of the day.

The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
In earth and sea and sky,
Aloud proclaim to mortal men,
That the coming of the Master
     draweth nigh.

It must be time for the waiting church 
To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps
To look for the breaking of the day.

There must be those in the field of sin,
Far from the fold astray,
Who once were happy in Jesus' love,
And looking for the breaking of the day.

Go quickly out in the streets and lanes,
And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt and blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the day."
342;Faith Of Our Fathers! Living Still;G;"Faith of our fathers! living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
Oh how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word

CHORUS
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children's fate,
If they, like them, could die for Thee!

Faith of our fathers! we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, 
As love knows how,
By kindly words and virtuous life!"
343;Under His Wings;C;"Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Though the night deepens 
     and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him, 
I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, 
And I am His child.

CHORUS
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

Under His wings, 
What a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly 
Turns to His rest!
Often when earth has 
No balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, 
And there I am blest.

Under His wings, 
O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till 
Life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, 
No evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus 
I'm safe evermore."
344;Lead Me, Saviour;C;"Saviour lead me, lest I stray,
Gently lead me all the way;
I am safe when by Thy side, 
I would in Thy love abide.

Chorus
Lead me, lead me, Saviour, 
lead me, lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me Saviour, all the way.

Thou the refuge of my soul,
When life's stormy billows roll,
I am safe when Thou art nigh,
All my hopes on Thee rely.

Saviour, lead me, then at last, 
When the storm of life is past,
To the land of endless day, 
Where all tears are wiped away."
345;I See A Crimson Stream;Ab;"On Calvary's hill of sorrow
Where sin's demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid.

CHORUS
I see a crimson stream of blood.
It flows from Calvary,
Its waves which reach 
the throne of God,
Are sweeping over me.

Today no condemnation
Abides to turn away
My soul from His salvation,
He's in my heart to stay.

When gloom and sadness whisper
You've sinned, no use to pray,
I look away to Jesus,
And He tells me to say:

And when we reach the portal
Where life forever reigns,
The ransomed hosts grand final
Will be this glad refrain."
346;Like Zion's Holy Mount;C;"All they who put their trust in God
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount,
By many ages proved.

Chorus
Like the mount of God, 
Like the mount of God;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
By many ages proved.
They can never be removed, removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
They can never be removed.

As round about Jerusalem
The rugged mountains lie,
So round about His holy saints
Our God is ever nigh.

Tho' fierce the storm in fury beat
And awful thunders roar,
The children of the mighty God
Are safe forevermore.

Thus over-shadowed by His love,
Where harm can ne'er betide,
Within this refuge safe and sure
I ever would abide"
347;My Faith Looks Up To Thee;Eb;"My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Saviour divine!
Now hear me while I pray,
Take all my sin away,
O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When ends life's transient dream,
When death's cold, sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll;
Blest Saviour, then, in love,
Fear and distrust remove;
O bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul!"
348;Blessed Be The Name;Ab;"All praise to Him who reigns above,
In majesty supreme,
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem.

CHORUS
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

His name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father's own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.

His name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace;
Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

Redeemer, Saviour, Friend of man,
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,
For Thou hast died for all.

Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord;
Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord.

There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord;
There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord.

Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord;
Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord."
349;Joy Unspeakable;Ab;"I have found His grace 
Is all complete,
He supplieth every need;
While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet,
I am free, yes free indeed.

CHORUS
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Oh, the half has never yet been told.

I have found the pleasure 
I once craved,
It is joy and peace within;
What a wondrous blessing! 
I am saved
From the awful guilt of sin.

I have found that hope 
So bright and clear,
Living in the realm of grace;
Oh, the Saviour's presence is so near,
I can see His smiling face.

I have found the joy 
No tongue can tell,
How its waves of glory roll!
It is like a great o'erflowing well,
Springing up within my soul."
350;Higher Ground;Ab;"I'm pressing on 
the upward way,
New heights I'm 
gaining everyday;
Still praying as 
I'm onward bound,
Lord, plant my feet 
on higher ground.

CHORUS
Lord, lift me up 
and let me stand,
By faith on 
Heaven's table land,
A higher plane 
than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet 
on higher ground.

My heart has no 
desire to stay
Where doubts arise 
and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell 
Where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, 
is higher ground.

I want to scale
the utmost height,
And catch a gleam 
of glory bright;
But still I'll pray
till heaven I've found,
Lord, lead me 
on to higher ground.

I want to live
above the world,
Though Satan's darts 
at me are hurled;
For faith has caught 
the joyful sound,
The song of saints
on higher ground."
351;In The Twinkling Of An Eye;Bb;"When the trump of the great archangel
Its mighty tones shall sound,
And, the end of the world proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of man shall come in His glory,
With all the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies 
     from the multitudes that rise,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Chorus
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
The trumpet shall sound, the dead 
     shall be raised,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

When He comes in the clouds descending,
And they who loved Him here,
From their graves shall awake and praise Him
With joy and not with fear;
When the body and the soul are united,
And clothed no more to die,
What a shouting there will be 
     when each other's face we see,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Oh the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in pow'r
And the songs of the blood-bought millions 
Shall hail that blissful hour;
When we gather safely home in the morning,
And night's dark shadows fly,
What a shouting on the shore
     when we meet to part no more,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye."
352;Break Thou The Bread Of Life;C;"Break Thou the bread of life,
Dear Lord to me,
As Thou didst break
The loaves beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page,
I seek Thee Lord;
My spirit pants for Thee,
Oh living Word!

Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord
To me, To me,
As Thou didst bless
The bread by Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My All in All.

Teach me to live, dear Lord,
Only for Thee,
As Thy disciples lived in Galilee;
Then, all my struggles o'er,
Then, victory won,
I shall behold Thee, Lord,
The living One."
353;Rock Of Ages;Ab;"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side 
which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make
me pure.

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
This for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, 
and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

While I draw this fleeting breath
and the rapture I behold
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee."
354;Signs Are Everywhere;Bb;"The King is coming in glory 
To catch His bride away,
It may be in the morning  
It may be at mid-day, 
At the even or midnight; 
The trump will sound so clear,
The dead in Christ, and we that live,
His voice shall hear.

Chorus
The King is coming, hallelujah! 
He's coming in the air,
The fig tree is budding, 
The signs are everywhere,
The saints are looking ever up-ward
While jour'ning on their way, 
He's coming, hallelujah!
To catch his bride away.

Behold! He cometh, and leaping  
And skipping o'er the hills;
Like the young roe, like the young hart, 
My soul with rapture thrills; 
Through the window He's looking,
Through the lattice-work is seen, 
The winter's past, the rain is o'er, 
The figs are green.

The King is coming , ""Be ready,""  
To meet Him on that day;
With your heart right, 
     with your robes white,
And in this holy way;  
Like the light'ning that flashes
In the twinkling of an eye, 
Our Lord shall come to claim His own
He's drawing nigh."
355;I Remember Calvary;Eb;"Where He may lead me, I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him so,
And I remember 'twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

CHORUS
Jesus shall lead me night and day,
Jesus shall lead me all the way,
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

Oh, I delight in His command,
Love to be lead by His dear hand;
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.

Onward I go, no doubt, nor fear,
Happy with Christ my Saviour near,
Trusting that I some day shall see,
Jesus, my Friend of Calvary."
356;Close To Thee;F;"Thou, my everlasting portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Saviour let me walk with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
All along my pilgrim journey,
Saviour let me walk with Thee.

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Nor for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me through the vale of shadows,
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee."
357;Cleanse Me;F;"Search me, Oh God, 
And know my heart today;
Try me, Oh Saviour, 
Know my thoughts, I pray:
See if there be some wicked 
way in me:
Cleanse me from every sin, 
and set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord, 
For cleansing me from sin:
Fulfill Thy Word, and make me 
pure within:
Fill me with fire where once 
I burned with shame:
Grant my desire to magnify 
Thy name.

Lord take my life, 
and make it wholly Thine:
Fill my poor heart with 
Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, 
self and pride;
I now surrender: Lord in me abide.

Oh, Holy Ghost, 
revival comes from Thee:
Send a revival, 
Start the work in me:
Thy Word declares, 
Thou wilt supply our need:
For blessing now, Oh Lord, 
I humbly plead."
358;He Rolled The Sea Away;C;"When Israel out of bondage came,
A sea before them lay;
The Lord reach'd down 
His mighty hand,
And rolled the sea away.

Chorus
Then forward still, 
'tis Jehovah's will, 
Tho' the billows dash and spray,
With a conq'ring tread 
we will push ahead
He'll roll the sea away.

Before me was a sea of sin,
So great I feared to pray;
My heart's desire the Saviour read,
And rolled the sea away.

When sorrows dark, like stormy waves,
Were dashing o'er my way,
Again the Lord in mercy came, 
And rolled the sea away.

And when I reach the sea of death,
For needed grace I'll pray;
I know the Lord will quickly come,
And roll the sea away."
359;Oh That Will Be Glory;F;"When all my labors and trials are o'er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

CHORUS
Oh that will be glory for me,
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace 
I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.

When by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in Heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Friends will be there 
I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me."
360;He Was Nailed To The Cross For Me;Eb;"What a wonderful, wonderful Saviour,
Who would die on the cross for me!
Freely shedding His precious life blood,
That the sinner might be made free.

CHORUS
He was nailed to the cross for me,
He was nailed to the cross for me;
On the cross crucified, for me He died;
He was nailed to the cross for me.

Thus He left His heavenly glory
To accomplish His Father's plan;
He was born of the Virgin Mary,
Took upon Him the form of man.

He was wounded  for our transgressions,
And He carried our sorrows, too;
He's the Healer of every sickness,
This He came to the world to do.

So He gave His life for others
In redeeming this world from sin,
And He's gone to prepare a mansion,
That at last we may enter in."
361;Redeemed;Ab;"Redeemed how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child and forever, I am.

Chorus
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night."
362;God Leads Us Along;Eb;"In shady green pastures, 
So rich and sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water's cool flow 
Bathes the weary one's feet,
God leads His dear children along.

CHORUS
Some thro' the waters, 
Some thro' the flood,
Some thro' the fire, 
But all thro' the blood;
Some thro' great sorrow, 
But God gives a song;
In the night season 
And all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount 
Where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley 
In the darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

Tho' sorrows befall us, 
And Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, 
Defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.

Away from the mire, 
And away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity's day.
God leads His dear children along."
363;He Brought Me Out;C;"My heart was distressed 
'Neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins 
Dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord 
From the deep, miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out 
     to golden day.

CHORUS
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah.

He placed me upon 
The strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established 
     and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling 
While here I remain,
But stand by His grace 
Until the crown I gain.

He gave me a song, 
'Twas a new song of praise,
By day and by night 
Its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing, 
I'm happy and free,
I'll praise my Redeemer, 
Who has rescued me.

I'll sing of His wonderful 
     mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men 
His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation 
At home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth 
And trust in God.

I'll tell of the pit, 
With its gloom and despair,
I'll praise the dear Father, 
Who answered my prayer;
I'll sing my new song, 
The glad story of love,
Then join in the chorus 
With the saints above."
364;Beneath The Cross Of Jesus;C;"Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the 
     noonday heat,
And the burden of the day.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart 
     with tears,
Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love
And my own worthlessness.

I take, Oh cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross."
365;Like A Mighty Sea;F;"My soul today is thirsting 
     for living streams divine,
To sweep from highest heaven 
     to this poor heart of mine;
I stand upon the promise, 
     in Jesus' name I plead;
Oh send the gracious current
     to satisfy my need.

Chorus
Like a mighty sea,
      like a mighty sea,
Comes the love of Jesus, 
     sweeping over me;
The waves of glory roll,
     the Saviour to extol,
Comes the love of Jesus,
     sweeping o'er my soul.

I see the clouds arising,
     the mercy clouds of love,
That come to bring refreshing
   down from the throne above,
The earnest of the shower,
     just now to us is giv'n,
And now we wait, expecting 
     the floods of grace from heav'n.

The show'rs of grace are falling,
     the tide is rolling in,
The flood-tide of salvation,
     with pow'r to cleanse from sin;
It's surging thro' my being 
     and takes my sin away,
It keeps me shouting glory!
     thro' all the happy day.

It's coming, yes, it's coming,
     it's coming down this hour,
A torrent of salvation  
     in saving cleansing pow'r.
I hear the billows surging,
     I see them mount and roll;
Oh glory, hallelujah!
     they're sweeping thro' my soul."
366;Glory To His Name;F;"Down at the cross 
Where my Saviour died,
Down where for cleansing 
From sin I cried;
There to my heart 
Was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

CHORUS

Glory to His name!
There to my heart 
Was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

Saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly 
Abides within,
There at the cross 
Where He took me in;
Glory to His name!

Oh, precious fountain 
That saves from sin!
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me 
And keeps me clean;
Glory to His name!

Come to this fountain 
So rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul 
At the Saviour's feet;
Plunge in today 
And be made complete;
Glory to His name!"
367;It Is Mine;Bb;"God's abiding peace 
Is in my soul today,
Yes, I feel it now,
Yes, I feel it now;
He has taken all my 
Doubts and fears away,
Though I cannot tell you how.

CHORUS
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
He has given peace, 
Perfect peace to me;
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
Mine for all eternity!

He has wrought in me 
A sweet and perfect rest,
In my raptured heart 
I can feel it now;
He each passing moment 
Keeps me saved and blest,
Floods with light 
My heart and brow.

He has given me 
A never failing joy,
Oh, I have it now! 
Oh, I have it now!
To His praise I will my 
Ransomed pow'rs employ,
And renew my grateful vow.

Oh, the love of God 
Is comforting my soul,
For His love is mine, 
Yes, His love is mine!
Waves of joy and gladness 
O'er my spirit roll,
Thrilling me with life divine."
368;Builded On The Rock;F;"I builded on the Rock,
On the Rock of God,
Builded on the Rock,Christ Jesus;
I dug down deep 
And builded on the Rock,
Builded on the Rock of God.

Chorus
I hold not the Rock,
But the Rock holds me
The Rock holds me, 
The Rock holds me;
I rest on the Rock,
And the Rock holds me,
Resting on the Rock of God.

Why should I fear 
When the winds sweep by?
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Or shaken be when 
The waves roll high?
Builded on the Rock of God.

Hush, raging billows at His command, 
Builded of the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Oh, peace be still 'neath 
His loving hand!
Builded on the Rock of God.

Praise God for our foundation sure! 
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
No storms can harm our house secure,
Builded on the Rock of God."
369;At Calvary;C;"Years I spent in vanity 
     and pride,
Caring not my Lord 
     was crucified,
Knowing not it was for 
     me He died
On Calvary.

CHORUS
Mercy there was great, 
     and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied 
     to me;
There my burdened soul 
     found liberty,
At Calvary.

By God's Word at last my 
     sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law 
     I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring 
     turned
To Calvary.

Now I've given to Jesus 
     everything,
Now I gladly own Him as 
     my King,
Now my raptured soul can 
     only sing
Of Calvary.

Oh, the love that drew 
     salvation's plan!
Oh, the grace that brought 
      it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that 
     God did span
At Calvary!"
370;My Burdens Rolled Away;F;"I remember when my burdens 
     rolled away,
I had carried them for years, 
Night and day;
When I sought the blessed Lord, 
And I took Him at His Word,
Then at once all 
My burdens rolled away.

CHORUS
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away;
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away.

I remember when 
My burdens rolled away,
That I feared would never leave 
Night or day;
Jesus showed to me the loss, 
So I left them at the cross,
I was glad when 
My burdens rolled away.

I am singing since 
My burdens rolled away,
There's a song within my heart 
Night and day;
I am living for my King, 
And with joy I shout and sing
Hallelujah! all 
My burdens rolled away."
371;Bring Them In;F;"Hark, 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who've gone astray
Far from the Shepherd's fold away.

Chorus
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring the little ones to Jesus.

Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wandering ones to find?
Who'll bring the lost ones the fold,
Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountains wild and high,
Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee,
""Go find My sheep where'er they be."""
372;Jesus Paid It All;Eb;"I hear the Saviour say,
""Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.""

CHORUS
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.

Since nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
""Jesus died my soul to save,""
My lips shall still repeat."
373;Friendship With Jesus;C;"A friend of Jesus, oh, what bliss
That one so vile as I
Should ever have a friend 
like this
To lead me to the sky.

CHORUS
Friendship with Jesus,
Fellowship divine;
Oh, what blessed sweet 
communion,
Jesus is a friend of mine.

A friend when other friendships 
cease,
A friend when others fail;
A friend who gives me joy 
and peace,
A friend when foes assail.

A friend to lead me in the dark,
A friend who knows the way;
A friend to steer my weak, 
frail bark,
A friend my debts to pay.

A friend when sickness lays 
me low,
A friend when death draws near;
A friend as through the vale I go,
A friend to help and cheer.

A friend when life's short race 
is o'er.
A friend when earth is past;
A friend to meet on heaven's 
shore,
A friend when home at last."

Never fear the storms of sin,

     the morrow,
Even now our joys begin.

Shout His praises,
For our victory is nigh!
We shall join our 
     conquering Saviour,
We shall reign with Him 
     on high!

Where the joys celestial glow,
Oh, there's peace and rest and love,
Where the healing waters flow!

Now with Jesus crucified,
At his feet I'm resting low;
Let me evermore abide

And come at my call,
But a stranger's voice do they
not know.

My sheep know my voice
And day by day
They abide in the fold
And go not astray;
They love me because
I have made them my choice
And they follow my call
For my sheep know my voice.

My sheep know my voice
And the pastures of green
Where I lead them so often to feed;
My sheep know my voice and the
cool sparkling stream
Where beside its still waters I lead.

My sheep know my voice
And the valley of death
Through which I shall lead them
some day;
But no danger nor harm can touch
one of them
For I will be with them alway."

Just in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood.

Life and rest, and joy and peace.

Oh ye righteous,
Your perfect redemption is nigh;
Swiftly the darkness of midnight approaches,
""He cometh,"" shall sound from the sky.
Long has the battle been waged against evil
By suffering saints here below.
Jesus is coming to banish our sorrow,
And lead us where tears never flow.

Come, dear Lord Jesus. 
Thy promise fulfilling;
""Come quickly!"" our souls cry to Thee:
Long has the world been enthralled 
     by the tempter,
The curse is on land and on sea.

Beautiful visions of glory I see;

(2X)

Sowing in the sunshine,
Sowing in the shadows,
Fearing neither clouds 
Nor winter's chilling breeze;
By and by the harvest,
And the labor ended,
We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves.

Going forth with weeping,
Sowing for the Master,
Though the loss sustained 
Our spirit often grieves;
When our weeping's over,
He will bid us welcome,
We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves."
382;Hold The Fort;C;"Ho, my comrades! see the signal,
Waving in the sky!
Reinforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh.

Chorus
""Hold the fort, for I am coming,""
Jesus signals still;
Wave the answer back to heaven,
""By Thy grace we will.""

See the mighty host advancing,
Satan leading on;
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone!

See the glorious banner waving!
Hear the trumpet blow!
In our Leader's name we'll triumph
Over ev'ry foe.

Fierce and long the battle rages,
But our help is near;
Onward comes our great Commander.
Cheer, my comrades, cheer."
383;He Took My Sins Away;Ab;"I came to Jesus,

He took my sins away.

CHORUS
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away,
And keeps me singing every day!
I'm so glad He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.

The load of sin 
Was more than I could bear,
He took them all away,
He took them all away.
And now on Him 
I roll my every care,
He took my sins away.

No condemnation 
Have I in my heart,
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.
His perfect peace 
He did to me impart,
He took my sins away.

If you will come 
To Jesus Christ today,
He'll take your sins away,
He'll take your sins away.
And keep you happy 
In His love each day,
He'll take your sins away."
384;Honey In The Rock;F;"Oh, my brother do you know

Oh, there's Honey in the Rock, 
     my brother,
There's Honey in the Rock for you;
Leave your sins for the blood 
     to cover,
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Have you ""tasted that the Lord 
     is gracious?""
Do you walk in the way that's new?
Have you drunk from 
The living fountain?
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Do you pray unto God the Father,
""What wilt Thou have me to do?""
Never fear, He will surely answer:
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Then go out through the streets 
     and byways,
Preach the Word 
To the many or few;
Say to every fallen brother,
""There's Honey in the Rock for you."""
385;Blessed Assurance;C;"Blessed assurance,

This is my song.
Praising my Saviour, 
All the day long;
This is my story, 
This is my song.
Praising my Saviour, 
All the day long.

Perfect submission, 
Perfect delight!
Visions of rapture 
Now burst on my sight;
Angels, descending, 
Bring from above,
Echoes of mercy, 
Whispers of love.

Perfect submission, 
All is at rest!
I in my Saviour, 
Am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, 
Looking above,
Filled with His goodness, 
Lost in His love."
386;Jesus Opened up the Way;Ab;"Jesus Christ the Lord 
Opened up the way to glory
When He died to save us 
From our ruined state.
And He asks that we shall go
Tell the world the story,
How His blood will save them
From their awful fate.

Chorus
Jesus opened up 
The way to heaven's gate
When He died on the cross
To redeem all the lost;
He prepared the road 
That leads to His abode,
'Tis a road, marked by blood
But it leads us home to God.

And the way is marked
By the foot-prints of the Saviour,
With His blood He made it,
Made it plain and straight;
If you walk that way,
It will lead you into heaven,
Lead you safely into 
Glory's golden gate.

Sinner, will you come and join
      in this heav'nly journey,
Walk the bloody pathway 
That the Saviour trod;
Then when life is over 
And all the sheaves are garnered,
You will meet the Saviour 
     and be not afraid."
387;Master, The Tempest Is Raging;C;"Master, the tempest is raging! 
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o'er-shadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh;
""Carest Thou not that we perish?""
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

Chorus
""The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
Peace, be still!""
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
Or demons or men or whatever it be,
No water can swallow the ship where lies 
The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, be still! Peace be still! 
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, peace, be still!

Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
O waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul!
And I perish! I perish, dear Master; 
O hasten and take control!

Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast.
Linger, O blessed Redeemer, 
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
And rest on the blissful shore."
388;Worthy the Lamb;Eb;"""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
The hosts of heaven sing,
As before the throne 
They make His praises ring;
""Worthy is the Lamb 
The book to open wide,
Worthy is the Lamb 
Who once was crucified.""

Chorus
Oh, this bleeding Lamb, 
Oh, this bleeding Lamb,
Oh, this dying Lamb, 
He was found worthy;
Oh, this bleeding Lamb, 
Oh, this bleeding Lamb,
Oh, this dying Lamb, 
He was found worthy.

Worthy is the Lamb 
Who shed His precious blood
To restore a world 
To happiness and God;
""When no eye could pity 
And no arm could save,""
Jesus, for our ransom, 
Himself freely gave.

Worthy is the Lamb, 
The bleeding sacrifice 
Who for Adam's race 
Paid such a fearful price;
Worthy is the Lamb, 
The Paschal Lamb of God,
For the world received 
""Redemption thro' His blood.""

""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
Let men and angels sing, 
""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
Let hallelujah's ring ;
And when life is past, 
Upon the golden shore,
""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
We'll shout forevermore."
389;I Am Thine, Oh Lord;F;"I am Thine, oh Lord, 
I have heard Thy voice;
And it told Thy love to me.
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

CHORUS
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, 
nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now, 
to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up 
with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour,
That before Thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer, 
and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love 
that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy 
that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee."
390;Blessed Be The Fountain;C;"Blessed be the fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God:
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Though I've wandered far from His fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than the snow,
Whiter than the snow;
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o'ercame;
Grievous were the sorrows he bore,
But He suffered thus not in vain.
May I to that fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below;
Wash me in the blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me-
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."
391;I Need Thee Every Hour - Ndinosimuda She!;Ab;"I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

CHORUS
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
Every hour I need Thee!
Oh, bless me now, my Saviour,
I come to Thee!

I need Thee every hour,
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son."
392;Launch Out;C;"The mercy of God is an ocean divine,
A boundless and fathomless flood;
Launch out in the deep, cut away
     the shoreline,
And be lost in the fullness of God,

Chorus
Launch out into the deep,
Oh, let the shoreline go,
Launch out, launch out in the
     ocean divine,
Out where the full tides flow.

But many, alas! only stand 
    on the shore
And gaze on the ocean so wide;
They never have ventured its 
    depths to explore,
Or to launch on the fathomless tide.

And others just venture away 
    from the land,
And linger so near to the shore,
That the surf and the slime
      that beat over the strand,
Dash o'er them in floods evermore.


Oh,let us launch out on this
     ocean so broad,
Where the floods of salvation e'er flow;
Oh, let us be lost in the mercy of God,
Till the depths of His fullness we know."

Hear my humble cry;
While on others 
Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Chorus
Saviour, Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others 
Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Let me at thy
throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there 
in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only
in Thy merit, 
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded,
broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the Spring
 of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth
 beside Thee?
Whom in heav'n
 but Thee?"

Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee.

CHORUS
Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today,
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way;
Since the Saviour found,
     took away my sin
I have had the sunlight of His love within.

Tho' clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows 'round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul.

While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigour on,
And leave the world behind.

I cross the wide-extended fields,
I journey o'er the plain,
And in the sunlight of His love
I reap the golden grain.

Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The Light that came to me;
Behold the brightness of His face,
Thro'out eternity."
395;Glory To God, Hallelujah!;Eb;"We are never, never weary
of the grand old song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We can sing it loud as ever,
with our faith more strong;
Glory to God, hallelujah!

a right to shout and sing,
For the way is growing bright
and our souls are on the wing,
We are going by and by
to the palace of a King!

We are lost amid the rapture
of redeeming love;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We are rising on its pinions
to the hills above:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

We are going to a palace
that is built of gold;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
Where the King in all His splendor
we shall soon behold:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

There we'll shout redeeming mercy
in a glad, new song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
There we'll sing the praise of Jesus
with the blood-washed throng:
Glory to God, hallelujah!"
396;When We All Get to Heaven;Bb;"Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace;
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He'll prepare for us a place.

CHORUS
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will over-spread the sky;
But when trav'ling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev'ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold."
397;What, Never Thirst Again?;Bb;"There flows from Calvary a stream
For every sinner's pain,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never thirst again.

Chorus
What! never thirst again?
No, never thirst again;
What! never thirst again? 
No, never thirst again,
For he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

Earth's fountains fair,
But mock our souls,
Like desert phantoms lure,
And they that drink,the fainter grow,
The keener thirst endure.

This stream from Calvary still flows,
To bless and cleanse and heal,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
New life and rest shall feel.

Oh, blessed stream of pure delight! 
Oh, balm for ev'ry pain! 
To thee I haste, for Jesus said,
I'll never thirst again."
398;He Is Able To Deliver Thee;Ab;"'Tis the grandest theme

      that the world e'er sung,
""Our God is able to deliver thee.""

Chorus

He is able to deliver thee;
Tho' by sin opprest,
Go to Him for rest;

CHORUS
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

Tho' they are slighting Him,
Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried
That grace can restore:
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken
Will vibrate once more.

Rescue the perishing,
Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor
The Lord will provide:
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand'rer
     a Saviour has died."

faithful and sure;
Lean upon the Saviour,
and thy soul is secure."

One who can help 
 my burdens to bear;

And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.

Let us labor for the Master 
From the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous 
Love and care;

And our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder,

Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content, whatever lot I see,

And beyond I see the haven I desire;
There I view the beacon lights of home,

He's fairer than the lily, 
      brighter than the morning star;
He fills and satisfies
      my longing spirit o'er and o'er;
Each day He grows still sweeter 
      than He was the day before.

My heart is sometimes heavy,
      but He comes with sweet relief;
He folds me to His bosom

All I need to cleanse 
And make me fully whole.

In sorrow He's my comfort, 
In trouble He's my stay
He tells me every care 
On Him to roll.
He's the Lily of the Valley, 
The bright and morning star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand 
     to my soul.

He all my grief has taken, 
And all my sorrows borne;
In temptation He's my 
Strong and mighty tower;
I have all for Him forsaken, 
And all my idols torn from my heart, 
And now He keeps me by His power.

Though all the world forsake me, 
And Satan tempts me sore,
Through Jesus I shall 
Safely reach the goal;
He's the Lily of the Valley, 
The bright and morning star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand 
     to my soul.


He will never, never leave me, 
Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith 
And do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, 
I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He 
My hungry soul shall fill.

Then sweeping up to glory, 
To see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll!

The bright and morning star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand

Wonderful story of love; 
For all the pure and blest,
Rest in those mansions above us,
With those who've gone on before us,
Singing the rapturous chorus,

418;The Hallelujah Side;Ab;"Once a sinner far from Jesus, 
I was perishing with cold,
But the blessed Saviour 
Heard me when I cried;
Then He threw His robe around me, 
And He led me to His fold,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

CHORUS
Oh, glory be to Jesus, 
Let the hallelujahs roll;
Help me ring the Saviour's praises 
far and wide,
For I've opened up tow'rd heaven 
All the windows of my soul,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Tho' the world may sweep around me
With her dazzle and her dreams,
Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,
For my soul looks up to heaven 
Where the golden sunlight gleams,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Not for all earth's golden millions
Would I leave this precious place,
Tho' the tempter to persuade me 
oft has tried,
For I'm safe in God's pavilion,
Happy in His love and grace,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Here the sun is always shining,
Here the sky is always bright;
'Tis no place for gloomy 
Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music 
And my heart with great delight,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

And upon the streets of Glory, 
When we reach the other shore,
And have safely crossed the Jordan's 
rolling tide,
You will find me shouting ""Glory"" 
Just outside my mansion door,
Where I'm living on the hallelujah side."

Chorus
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.

Like a mighty army 
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading 
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided, 
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never 
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, 
Which can never fail.

At the sign of triumph,
Satan's host doth flee;
On, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise
Brothers, lift your voices
Loud your anthems raise!

Onward, then ye people! 
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud and honor, 
Unto Christ the King;
This thro' countless ages 
Men and angels sing."

CHORUS
Victory ahead! Victory ahead!
Through the blood of Jesus, 
     victory ahead;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I hear the conqueror's tread,
By faith I see the victory ahead.

David, with a shepherd's sling 
     and five stones,
Met the giant on the field all alone;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He knew what God had said,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Daniel prayed unto the Lord 
     thrice each day,
Then unto the lion's den led the way;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He did not fear or dread,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Often with the carnal mind I was tried,
Asking for deliverance oft I cried;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I reckoned I was dead,
By faith I saw the victory ahead.

When like those who've gone before 
     to that land,
By death's river cold and dark 
     I shall stand;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I will not fear or dread,
By faith I see the victory ahead."

To paths I do not know,
I'll answer dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I'll go where you want me to go.

Chorus
I'll go where you want me to go , dear Lord
O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord,
I'll be what you want me to be.

Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand'rer whom I should seek,
Oh Saviour, if Thou wilt be my Guide, 
Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I'll say what you want me to say.

There's surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth's harvest-fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life's short day
For Jesus, the Crucified.
So, trusting my all unto Thy care, 
I know Thou lovest me!
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what you want me to be."

Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."

Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
To burn up every trace of sin,
To bring the light and glory in,

Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

Throw out the Life-Line! 
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is drifting away!

With hand quick and strong;
Why do you tarry, 
Why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; 
Oh hasten today
And out with the Life-Boat! 
Away, then, away!

Throw out the Life-Line 
To danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish 
Where you've never been;
Winds of temptation 
And billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out 
Where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season 
Of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift 
To eternity's shore;
Haste then,my brother, 
No time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line 
And save them today."

To earth's sorrowing cry,
For the knowledge of the Lord shall fill
The earth and sea and sky;
God shall take away all sickness 
And the sufferer's tears will dry,
When our Saviour shall come back 
to earth again.

Yes, the ransomed of the Lord shall come 
To Zion then with joy,
And in all His holy mountain 
Nothing hurts or shall destroy;
Perfect peace shall reign in every heart,
and love without alloy,
After Jesus shall come back 
to earth again.

Then the sin and sorrow, pain and death
of this dark world shall cease,
In a glorious reign with Jesus of a
thousand years of peace;
All the earth is groaning, crying 
For that day of sweet release,
For our Jesus to come back 
to earth again."

To go and reign with Christ

Gladly may we herald the message 
Of His blessed appearing,
Soon He's coming in glory,

But get ready for the final call.

We're longing for the glory

Who shall overcome, 
     and ev'ry conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward,

Who has promised life 
      to all who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending, 
      the message being given,
And soon we'll see our Lord 
      face to face.

We see the signs appearing 
      of His blessed coming,
Lo, behold the fig leaves 
      now becoming green;
The gospel of His kingdom

CHORUS
Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noontide,
In sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation
Casts o'er me its power;
In the tempests of life,
On its wide heaving sea,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict,
When pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and
Breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials
Like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee,
Oh Thou Rock of my soul."

And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.

CHORUS
How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me!

For me it was in the garden
He prayed, ""Not My will, but Thine,""
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me."

Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story softly, 
That I may take it in,
That wonderful redemption,  
God's remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often, 
For I forget so soon,
The early dew of morning, 
Has passed away at noon.

Tell me the same old story 
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory 
Is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world's glory 
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell  me the old, old story: 
Christ Jesus makes thee whole."

And gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters 
And bid their tumult cease;
My pilot and deliverer, 
To Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him, 
He's at my side,

He is my Friend and Saviour, 
In Him my anchor's cast,
He drives away my sorrows 
And shields me from the blast;
By faith I'm looking upward 
Beyond life's troubled sea,
There I behold a haven 
Prepared for me."

On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell

I will sing of my  Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be."

From His lighthouse evermore,
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.

Chorus
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave!
Some poor fainting, struggling sea-man
You may rescue, you may save.

Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;
Some poor sailor tempest tossed,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost."

Some build their hopes on the 
     ever drifting sand,
Some on their fame, or their treasure, 
     or their land;
Mine's on a Rock that forever will stand,
Jesus, the ""Rock of Ages.""

That Rock's a cross, its arms outspread,
Celestial glory bathes its head;
To its firm base my all I bring,
And to the Rock of Ages cling.

That Rock's a tow'r, whose lofty height,
Illum'd with heav'n's unclouded light,
Opes wide its gate beneath the dome
Where saints find rest with Christ at home."
440;Wonderful Peace;Ab;"Far away in the depths 
Of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody 
Sweeter than psalm;
In celestial like strains 
It unceasingly falls
O'er my soul 
Like an infinite calm.

CHORUS
Peace! peace! wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray
In fathomless billows of love.

What a treasure I have 
In this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul;
So secure that no power 
Can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll.

I am resting tonight 
In this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus' control;
For I'm kept from all danger 
By night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul.

And me thinks when I rise 
To that city of peace,
Where the author of peace 
I shall see,
That one strain of the song 
Which the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom shall be:

Ah! soul, are you here 
Without comfort or rest,
Marching down the rough 
Pathway of time?
Make Jesus your friend 
Ere the shadows grow dark;
Oh, accept this sweet 
Peace so sublime."
441;'Tis Burning In My Soul;C;"God sent His mighty power 
    to this poor, sinful heart,
To keep me every hour, 
    and needful grace impart;
And since His Spirit came, 
    to take supreme control,
The love enkindled flame 
    is burning in my soul.

CHORUS
'Tis burning in my soul, 
    'tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heavenly love 
    is burning in my soul,
The Holy Spirit came, 
    all glory to His name!
The fire of heavenly love 
    is burning in my soul.

Before the cross I bow, 
    upon the altar lay
A willing offering now, 
    my all from day to day.
My Saviour paid the price,  
    my name He sweetly calls;
Upon the sacrifice the fire 
    from heaven falls.

No good that I have done, 
    His promise I embrace;
Accepted in the Son, 
    He saves me by His grace.
All glory be to God! 
    let hallelujahs roll;
His love is shed abroad, 
    the fire is in my soul."
442;Leaning On The Everlasting Arms;F;"What a fellowship, 
What a joy divine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
What a blessedness, 
What a peace is mine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

CHORUS
Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Oh, how sweet to walk 
In this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
Oh, how bright the path 
Grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

What have I to dread, 
What have I to fear,
Leaning on the everlasting arms?
I have blessed peace 
With my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms."
443;Victory;F;"Hallelujah, what a thought!
Jesus full salvation brought,
Victory, victory.
Let the powers of sin assail,
Heaven's grace can never fail,
Victory, victory.

CHORUS
Victory,  yes, victory;
Hallelujah! I am free
Jesus gives me victory.
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He is all in all to me.

I am trusting in the Lord,
I am standing on His word,
Victory, victory.
I have peace and joy within,
Since my life is free from sin,
Victory, victory.

Shout your freedom everywhere,
His eternal peace declare,
Victory, victory.
Let us sing it here below,
In the face of every foe,
Victory, victory.

We will sing it on that shore,
When this fleeting life is o'er,
Victory, victory.
Sing it here, ye ransomed throng,
Start the everlasting song:
Victory, victory."
444;His Yoke Is Easy;Ab;"The Lord is my Shepherd, 
I shall not want,
He maketh me down to lie
In pastures green, 
He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

CHORUS
His yoke is easy, 
His burden is light,
I've found it so, 
I've found it so;
He leadeth me 
By day and by night,
Where living waters flow.

My soul crieth out: 
""Restore me again,
And give me 
The strength to take
The narrow path 
     of righteousness,
E'en for Thine own 
     name's sake.""

Yea, though I should walk 
The valley of death,
Yet what should I fear from ill?
For Thou art with me and 
Thy rod and staff support me still."
445;Jesus Loves Even Me;F;"I am so glad that 
Our Father in heav'n
Tells of His love in the Book 
He has giv'n,
Wonderful things 
In the Bible I see;
This is the dearest 
That Jesus loves me.

CHORUS
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me:
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

Tho' I forget Him 
And wander away,
Still He doth love me 
Wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving 
Arms would I flee,
When I remember 
That Jesus loves me.

Oh, if there's only one 
Song I can sing,
When in His beauty 
I see the  great King,
This shall my song 
In eternity be:
""Oh, what a wonder 
That Jesus loves me.""

Jesus loves me,
And I know I love Him;
Love brought Him down
My poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was love made 
Him die on the tree;
Oh, I am certain that 
Jesus loves me!

If one should ask of me, 
How can I tell?
Glory to Jesus, 
I know very well!
God's Holy Spirit 
With mine doth agree,
Constantly witnessing 
Jesus loves me.

In this assurance 
I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus, 
I know I am blessed;
Satan, dismayed, from my 
Soul now doth flee,
When I just tell him that
Jesus loves me."
446;Beautiful;Bb;"Beautiful robes so white, 
Beautiful land of light,
Beautiful home so bright,
Where there shall come no night;
Beautiful crown I'll wear,
Shining with stars o'er there,
Yonder in mansions fair, 
Gather us there.

Chorus
Beautiful robes, beautiful land, 
Beautiful home, beautiful band,
Beautiful crown, shining so fair,
Beautiful mansion bright,
Gather us there.

Beautiful tho't to me,
We shall forever be 
Thine in eternity,
When from this world we're free;
Free from its toil and care,
Heavenly joys to share,
Let me cross over there;
This is my pray'r.

Beautiful things on high,
Over in yonder sky,
Thus I shall leave this shore,
Counting my treasures o'er;
Where we shall never die,
Carry me by and by,
Never to sorrow more,
Heavenly shore."
447;Sitting At The Feet Of Jesus;F;"Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
O what words I hear him say!
Happy place! so near, so precious!
May it find me there each day;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
I would look upon the past;
For His love has been so gracious,
It has won my heart at last.

Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Where can mortal be more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And, when weary, find sweet rest;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
There I love to weep and pray,
While I from his fullness gather
Grace and comfort every day.

Bless me, oh my Saviour, bless me,
As I sit low at Thy feet;
Oh look down in love upon me,
Let me see Thy face so sweet,
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
Make me holy as He is;
May I prove I've been with Jesus,
Who is all my righteousness."
448;The Cleansing Wave;C;"Oh! now I see the crimson wave,
The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save
Points to His wounded side.

CHORUS
The cleansing stream, I see, I see!
I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me!
Oh! praise the Lord, it cleanseth me,
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me!

I see the new creation rise,
I hear the speaking blood,
It speaks! polluted nature dies!
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

I rise to walk in heav'n's own light
Above the world and sin,
With heart made pure, and 
     garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

Amazing grace! 'tis heav'n below
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus know,
My Jesus crucified."
449;Nothing But The Blood;F;"What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.

CHORUS
Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.

For my cleansing, this I see,
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.
For my pardon this my plea,
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus;

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.

Now by this I'll overcome
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus
Now by this I'll reach my home
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus

Glory, glory thus I sing
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus
All my praise for this I bring,
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus"
450;I've Believed The True Report;Ab;"I've believed the true report,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the outer court,
Oh glory be to God!
I am all on Jesus' side,
On the altar sanctified,
To the world and sin I've died,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

CHORUS
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I have crossed the riven veil,
Where the glories never fail,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I am living in the presence 
of the King.

I'm a king and priest to God,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
By the cleansing of the blood,
Oh glory be to God!
By the Spirit's pow'r and light,
I am living day and night,
In the holiest place so bright,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I have passed the outer veil,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
Which did once God's light conceal,
Oh glory be to God!
But the blood has brought me in
To God's holiness so clean,
Where there's death to self and sin,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I'm within the holiest place,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the inner veil,
Oh glory be to God!
I am sanctified to God
By the power of the blood,
Now the Lord is my abode,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!"
451;Amazing Grace;F;"Amazing grace! 
How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, 
but now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught 
my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did 
that grace appear
The hour I first believed;

Thro' many dangers, 
toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought 
me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised 
good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my shield 
and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh 
and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, 
within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The world shall 
soon to ruin go,
The sun refuse to shine;
But God, who called 
me here below,
Shall be forever mine.

When we've been there 
ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days 
to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Amen
Praise God, Praise God, 
Amen.
Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Praise God,
Amen!"
452;At The Cross;Eb;"Alas, and did my Saviour Bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

CHORUS
At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light,
And the burdens of my heart, 
     rolled away,
It was there by faith, 
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day.

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
Tis all that I can do!"
453;Come Unto Me;C;"Hear the blessed Saviour 
     calling the oppressed,
""Oh ye heavy-laden, come 
     to Me and rest;
Come, no longer tarry, 
I your load will bear,
Bring Me ev'ry burden, 
     bring Me ev'ry care.""

Chorus
Come unto Me, 
I will give you rest;
Take My yoke upon you, 
Hear Me and be blest;
I am meek and lowly,
Come and trust My might;
Come, My yoke is easy,
And My burden's light.

Are you disappointed, 
      wand'ring here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt 
      and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle
      in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus, 
He will give you rest.

Stumbling on the mountains 
      dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling tow'rd the pit
      of hell's consuming flame,
By the pow'rs of sin 
      deluded and oppressed, 
Hear the tender Shepherd,
""Come to Me and rest.""

Have you by temptation 
      often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness 
      brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you, 
      if you'll claim His best,
In the Holy Spirit, 
He will give you rest."
454;Where He Leads Me;F;"I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
""Take thy cross and follow,
follow Me.""

Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
And go with me, with me all the way."
455;I Know Whom I Have Believed;C;"I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

CHORUS
But I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day.

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus thro' the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air."
456;I Believe Jesus Saves;F;"I am coming to Jesus for rest,
Rest, such as the purified know;
My soul is athirst to be blest,
To be washed and made 
     whiter than snow.

CHORUS
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow;
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow.

In coming, my sin I deplore,
My weakness and poverty show;
I long to be saved evermore,
To be washed and made 
     whiter than snow.

To Jesus I give up my all,
Every treasure and idol I know;
For His fullness of blessing I call,
Till His blood washes 
     whiter than snow"
457;Sweet By And By;F;"There's a land 
 that is fairer than day,
And by faith 
 we can see it afar;
For the Father waits 
 over the way,
To prepare us 
 a dwelling place there.

CHORUS
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet  
 on that beautiful shore.
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet 
 on that beautiful shore.

We shall sing
 on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs
 of the blest,
And our spirits 
 shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh 
 for the blessing of rest.

To our bountiful 
 Father above
We will offer 
 our tribute of praise,
For the glorious
  gift of His love
And the blessings 
 that hallow our days."
458;When I Survey;F;"When I survey the wondrous cross,
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all."
459;The Great Physician;Eb;"The Great Physician now is near;
The sympathizing Jesus.
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus.

Chorus
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

Your many sins are all forgiv'n,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to heav'n,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Saviour's name,
I love the name of Jesus.

And when to that bright world above
We rise to be with Jesus,
We'll sing around the throne of love,
His name, the name of Jesus."
460;The Old Account Settled;Ab;"There was a time on earth, 
When in the book of heaven
An old account was standing
For sins yet unforgiven;
My name was at the top, 
And many things below,
I went unto the keeper, 
And settled long ago.

CHORUS
Long ago, long ago, 
Yes the old account 
Was settled long ago;
And the record's clear today, 
For He washed my sins away,
When the old account 
Was settled long ago.

The old account was large, 
And growing every day,
For I was always sinning, 
And never tried to pay;
But when I looked ahead, 
And saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle,
I settled long ago.

When at the judgment bar, 
I stand before my King,
And He the book will open, 
He cannot find a thing;
Then will my heart be glad, 
While tears of joy will flow
Because I had it settled, 
And settled long ago.

When in that happy home, 
My Saviour's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story, 
And praise Him for His love;
I'll not forget that book, 
With pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled, 
And settled long ago.

O sinner, seek the Lord, 
Repent of all your sin,
For thus He hath commanded, 
If you would enter in;
And then if you should live 
A hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it, 
You settled long ago."
461;Stand Up For Jesus;G;"Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
ye soldiers of the cross,
Lift high His royal banner, 
it must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory, 
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished 
and Christ is Lord  indeed.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict, 
in this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him, 
against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, 
and strength to strength oppose.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus; 
stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you - 
ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor, 
and watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger, 
be never wanting there."
462;Yesterday, Today, Forever;Ab;"Oh, how sweet the glorious message, 
simple faith may claim;
Yesterday today, forever,
Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful, 
heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest; 
Glory to His name!

CHORUS
Yesterday, today, forever, 
Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never! 
Glory to His name,
Glory to His name, Glory to His name;
All may change but Jesus never! 
Glory to His name.

He who was the friend of sinners, 
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at 
His footstool penitently bow.
He who said, ""I'll not condemn thee, 
go and sin no more;""
Speaks to thee that word of pardon, 
as in days of yore.

Oft on earth He healed the sufferer 
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows 
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue, 
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His fullness 
Still will give as much.

As of old He walked to Emmaus, 
with them to abide;
So through all life's way He walketh, 
ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him, 
hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be this same Jesus, 
as He went away."
463;Revive Us Again;F;"We praise Thee, O God, 
For the Son of Thy love, 
For Jesus who died
And is now gone above.

Chorus
Hallelujah! 
Thine the glory,
Hallelujah! amen; 
Hallelujah!
Thine the glory, 
Revive us again.

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Saviour,
And scattered our night.

All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins
And has cleansed ev'ry stain.

Revive us again;
Fill each heart with Thy love,
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above."
464;Take The Name Of Jesus With You;F;"Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it, then, where'er you go.

Chorus
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

Take the name of Jesus with you,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

Oh the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven we'll 
    crown Him
When our journey is complete."
465;Jesus Loves Me;C;"Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak but He is strong.

CHORUS
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin.
Let His little child come in.

Jesus loves me! loves me still,
Though I'm very weak and ill;
From His shining throne on high,
Comes to watch me where I lie.

Jesus loves me; He will stay
Close beside me all the way;
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high."
466;Look To The Lamb Of God;F;"If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God;
He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.

CHORUS
Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,
For He alone is able to save you;
Look to the Lamb of God.

When Satan tempts, 
and doubts and fears assail,
Look to the Lamb of God;
You in His strength 
Shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you aweary, 
Does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer 
And fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows 
On your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow 
Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God."
467;Blest Be The Tie That Binds;F;"Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred
 minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, 
    our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other
 flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined
 in heart,
And hope to meet again.

From sorrow, toil and pain,
And sin we shall be free;
And perfect love and oneness
 reign
Through all eternity."
468;Sweet Hour Of Prayer;C;"Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear,
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Sunset's lofty height,
I view my home and take my flight:
This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing thro' the air,
Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"
469;When They Ring The Golden Bells;Eb;"There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore 
By faith's decree;
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells
for you and me.

Chorus
Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee.
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells
for you and me.

We shall know no sin nor sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond
the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells
for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
When in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the spirit
to be free
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Aiden,
When they ring the golden bells
for you and me."
470;Jesus, Lover Of My Soul;F;"Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high!
Hide me, oh my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:
Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me!
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, oh Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
False and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace."

Joy to the world! the Saviour reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills
    and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, and wonders of His love."

How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by:
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary;
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Oh holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend on us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today.
We hear the holy angels
The great glad tidings tell;
Oh come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel."

That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
From heaven's all-gracious King:""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still thro' the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
Oh rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing.

For lo, the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the evercircling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing."

No crib for a bed,

Asleep on the hay.

The Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
No crying He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle,
Till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever,
And love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And take us to heaven,
To live with Thee there."

Why do you wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Saviour is longing to bless you;
There's danger and death in delay."

630;Baptized Into The Body;G;"Have you been baptized into

Baptized with the Holy Ghost;
There is but one way to enter

Chorus
Are you in the Church 
    triumphant?
Are you in the Saviour's Bride?
Come and be baptized into 
    the Body,
And forevermore abide.

There is but one Church, 
    Bride or Body,
And into it we're all baptized;
By the one, true, promised 
     Holy Spirit;
Though by the world we're 
     all despised.

Every creed has claimed to be 
     the Body,
But the ""plumb line"" proved 
    untrue
All their dreams, for God has so 
     determined
To bring His Son's true Bride 
      to view.

Many thought that they were in 
    the Body,
'Till the Holy Ghost had come;
When the Word of God was 
    opened to them,
They entered in, and yet 
      there's room.

Those who died before the 
    Holy Spirit
Came upon us from on high,
May, by faith with Saints of 
    old departed,
Arise to meet Him in the sky.

When the Bridegroom comes, 
     will you be ready;
And your vessel all filled and 
       bright?
You will be among the foolish 
      virgins
If you do not walk in the light."

Farther along we'll know
all about it,
Farther along we'll
understand why;
Cheer up, my brother,

We'll understand it all
by and by.

When death has come and 
taken our loved ones,
It leaves our home so lonely 
and drear;
Then do we wonder why 
others prosper,
Living so wicked year after year.

Faithful till death said our 
loving Master,
A few more days to labor 
and wait;
Toils of the road will then seem 
as nothing,
As we sweep through the beautiful 
gate.

When we see Jesus coming in glory,
When He comes from His home 
in the sky;
Then we shall meet Him in that 
bright mansion,
We'll understand it all by and by."

To Him who merits all my

Let cheerful anthems fill

While to that sacred shrine
I move.

'Tis done; the great

Charmed to confess the

O who will come and 
go with me?
I am bound for the

O'er all those wide 
extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son
forever reigns,
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds, nor
pois'nous breath, 
Can reach that healthful
shore; 
Sickness and sorrow, 
pain and death,
Are feared and felt no more.

When shall I reach that 
happy place,
And be forever blest!
When shall I see my 
Father's face,
And in His bosom rest?"
637;I Won't Cross Alone;Eb;"When I come to the river
at ending of day, 
When the last winds of 
sorrow have blown;
There'll be somebody waiting 
to show me the way,
I won't have to cross Jordan
alone.

CHORUS
I won't have to cross Jordan 
alone,
Jesus died all my sins 
to atone;
When the darkness I see, 
He'll be waiting for me,
I won't have to cross Jordan 
alone.

Often times I'm forsaken, and 
weary and sad,
When it seems that my friends 
have all gone;
There is one thought that cheers 
me and makes my heart glad,
I won't have to cross Jordan 
alone.

Though the billows of sorrow 
and  trouble may sweep,
Christ the Saviour will care for 
His own;
Till the end of the journey, my 
soul He will keep,
I won't have to cross Jordan 
alone"
638;I'd Rather Be An Old-Time Christian;Eb;"In this world I've tried most everything,
And I'm happy now to say
There is nothing like religion
In the good old-fashioned way;
I am walking in the old-time way,
And I want the world to know
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

CHORUS
I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know,
There's nothing like an old-time  Christian
With a Christian love to show;
I'm walking in the grand old highway,
And I'm telling everywhere I go,
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

There are many things I'd like to be
As my journey I pursue,
I have longed to be a leader
Like a mortal man would do;
I would like to be a millionaire,
With a million to bestow,
But I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

All the world is bright since I got right,
Now I sing and pray and shout,
All my burdens have been lifted
Since the Saviour brought me out;
I will tell the world both far and near
As I travel here below,
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know."

I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
for my name.

If my heart is right when He
calls me, 
If my heart is right I will hear
If my heart is right when He
calls me, 
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
for my name.

If my robe is white
when He calls me, 
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white
when He calls me. 
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
for my name."
640;I'll Meet You;Eb;"I will meet you in the morning, by 
 the bright river side,
When all sorrow has drifted away;
I'll be standing at the portals, when
      the gates open wide,
At the close of life's long, dreary day.

CHORUS
I'll meet you in the morning with a
    ""How do you do,""
And we'll sit down by the river and 
   with rapture ""auld"" acquaintance
    renew, 
You'll know me in the morning, by 
   the smiles that I wear,
When I meet you in the morning, in 
    the city that is built foursquare.

I will meet you in the morning, in the
    sweet by and by,
And exchange the old cross for 
    a crown; 
There will be no disappointments and
      nobody shall die,
In that land, e'er the sun goeth down.

I will meet you in the morning, at the 
    end of the way,
On the streets of that city of gold; 
Where we all can be together and be 
    happy for aye,
While the years and the ages shall roll."
641;It Shall Flow Like A River;C;"It shall flow like a river, It 
   shall fall like the rain,
It shall rise as the dew in 
   morning o'er the plain;
For the knowledge of the 
     Lord shall fill all the earth
When the Spirit of the Lord 
    shall fall.

Flow, river, flow; flow, river, flow;
Flow out through the nations 	
    wherever man may go;
Cause life to spring forth, that 
    all men may know
That You're the river of the Spirit; 
    Oh, flow, river, flow."
642;Just A Closer Walk;C;"I am weak but Thou
art strong,
Jesus keep me from 
all wrong;
I'll be satisfied as long,
As I walk let me walk 
close to Thee.

Chorus
Just a closer walk with 
Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my 
plea;
Daily walking close to 
Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let
it be.

Through this world of toil 
and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden 
shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, 
none but Thee.

When my feeble life is o'er,
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o'er,
To Thy kingdom shore, 
To thy shore."
643;Lift HIm Up;Ab;"How to reach the masses,
    men of every birth?
For an answer Jesus gave 
    a key
""And I, if I be lifted up 
     from the earth, 
Will draw all men unto me.""

Chorus
Lift Him up, lift Him up,
Still He speaks from eternity,
""And I, if I be lifted up from 
    the earth,
 Will draw all men unto me.""

Oh the world is hungry for the 
     living bread,
Lift the Saviour up for them
    to see; 
Trust Him, and do not doubt 
    the words that He said,
""I'll draw all men unto me.""

Don't exalt the preacher, 
    don't exalt the pew.
Preach the Gospel simple, 
     full and free; 
Prove Him and you will find
       that promise is true,
""I'll draw all men unto me.""

Lift Him up by living as a 
    Christian ought,
Let the world in you the 
    Saviour see, 
Then men will gladly follow 
     Him, who once taught,
""I'll draw all men unto me."""
644;No Disappointment;Eb;"There's no disappointment in Heaven,
No weariness, sorrow or pain;
No hearts that are bleeding and broken,
No song with a minor refrain.
The clouds of our earthly horizon
Will never appear in the sky,
For all will be sunshine and gladness,
With never a sob nor a sigh.

Chorus
I'm bound for that Beautiful City
My Lord has prepared for His own;
Where all the redeemed of all ages
Sing ""Glory!"" around the white Throne',
Sometimes I grow homesick for Heaven,
And the glories I there shall behold:
What a joy that will be when my Saviour
I see,
In that beautiful City of Gold!

We'll never pay rent for our mansion,
The taxes will never come due:
Our garments will never grow threadbare,
But always be fadeless and new.
We'll never be hungry nor thirsty,
Nor languish in poverty there,
For all the rich bounties of Heaven
His sanctified children will share.

There'll never be crape on the doorknob,
No funeral train in the sky;
No graves on the hillsides of glory,
For there we shall nevermore die.
The old will be young there forever,
Transformed in a moment of time;
Immortal we'll stand in His likeness,
The stars and the sun to outshine."
645;Past The Curtain Of Time;Eb;"There's a curtain that's drawn 
   between earth and Heaven,
And just beyond lies a beautiful 
   clime 
Where the evils of this life no
    longer can touch me;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
    of time.

Chorus
Lord, let me. look Past the curtain 
    of sorrows and fear,
Let me view that sunny bright clime;
It would strengthen my faith and 
    would banish all fear;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
   of time.

I'm helpless, alone, and I want to 
    see Jesus,
And hear the sweet harbor bells
    chime, 
Where, my friends and dear loved
     ones are waiting for me;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
   of time.

I'm so homesick and blue, and I 
    want to see Jesus,
I would like to hear those sweet 
     harbor bells chime;
It would brighten my Path and 
    would vanish all fear;
Lord. let me look past the curtain 
   of time."
646;Precious Memories;Ab;"Precious memories, 
unseen angels,
Sent from somewhere 
to my soul;
How they linger, 
ever near me,
And the sacred past untold.

CHORUS
Precious memories, 
how they linger,
How they ever flood 
my soul;
In the stillness of the 
midnight,
Precious, sacred scenes
unfold.

Precious father, 
loving mother,
Fly across the lonely years;
And old home scenes of
my childhood,
In fond memory appear.

In the stillness of the
midnight,
Echoes from the past 
I hear;
Old-time singing, 
gladness bringing,
From that lovely land 
somewhere.

As I travel on life's 
pathway,
Know not what the 
years may hold;
As I ponder, 
hope grows fonder,
Precious memories
flood my soul.

Precious memories of 
the prophet,
Flood my soul from day 
to day,
I remember scenes so
precious
That can never pass 
away.

I've heard the Message 
and Its signal
That day's end is near 
at hand,
But I remember that He 
promised
He'd return for those 
who'd stand.

Precious memories, 
glorious meetings
Across this land from 
sea to sea
Where I heard the
prophet's Message
That brought Life and
hope to me.

Precious memories in
this storehouse
Where the Food was
laid away,
We've returned to where 
he stored It,
Spiritual Food against this 
day."
647;Room At The Fountain;Eb;"I heard my loving Saviour 
   say,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee,
Come, wash the stains 
     of sin away,
There's room at the 
     fountain for thee.

Chorus
Room, room, yes, there 
   is room,
Room at the fountain 
    for thee;
Room, room, yes, there
     is room,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

I came to Him, my sins 
    confessed,
There was room at the 
    fountain for me;
When I gave up, my heart 
    was blest,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

I plunged beneath the
    crimson tide,
There was room at the 
     fountain for me;
And now by faith am 
      sanctified,
There's room at the 
      fountain for thee.

I found the crimson 
    stream I know,
There was room at the
    fountain for me;
His blood has washed 
    me white as snow,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

He cleansed my heart 
   from inbred sin,
There was room at the 
    fountain for me;
And now He keeps me
    pure within,
There's room at the 
   fountain for thee,

I'll praise Him while He
    gives me breath,
There was room at the 
    fountain for me;
He saved me from an 
    awful death,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

His blood was shed 
  but once for all,
There was room at the 
   fountain for me;
Oh, don't reject sweet 
   Merey's call,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

We'll sing with all the
     saints above,
There was room at the 
    fountain for me;
And praise Him for 
    redeeming love,
There's room at the fountain for thee."
648;The Cloud And Fire;Eb;"As of old, when the hosts  of Israel 
Were compelled in the  wilderness 
   to dwell,
Trusting they in their God 
     to lead the way
To the light of perfect day.

CHORUS
So the sign of the fire by night,
And the sign of the cloud by day,
Hovering o'er, just before,
As they journey on their way,
Shall a guide and a leader be,
Till the wilderness be past,
For the Lord, our God, in His 
    own good time
Shall lead to the light at last.

To and fro, as a ship without 
  a sail, 
Not a compass to guide them
     through the vale,
But the sign of their God was 
     ever near, 
Thus their fainting hearts 
    to cheer.

All the days of their wanderings 
   they were fed,
To the land of the promise they 
    were led;
By the hand of the Lord in 
   guidance sure,
They were brought to Canaan's 
    shore."
649;The Eastern Gate;Ab;"I will meet you in the morning,
Just inside the Eastern Gate,
Then be ready, faithful pilgrim,
Lest with you it be too late.

CHORUS
I will meet you, I will meet you 
Just inside the Eastern Gate 
   over there; 
I will meet you, I will meet you, 
I will meet you in the morning 
    over there.

If you hasten off to glory,
Linger near the Eastern Gate.,
For I'm coming in the morning,
So you'll not have long to wait.

Keep your lamps all trimmed 
    and burning,
For the Bridegroom watch 
    and wait, 
He'll be with us at the meeting, 
Just inside the Eastern Gate.

O the joys of that glad meeting
With the saints who for us wait, 
What a blessed, happy meeting,
Just inside the Eastern Gate."
650;The End Time;F;"I look and see earth's 
   sorrowing picture, 
The hoarding mobs for 
   selfish gain; 
Their toil of hand for ease 
   and comforts 
Can they not see, their doom 
    is sealed, it's all in vain.

CHORUS
The end is here, it's now at 
   hand,
The Bride is gathering; the 
   world is failing;
Israel's awak'ning; nations 
  are  breaking;
Our prophet taught us, we 
   believe the end is here.

Sirs, this is the time! our 
   prophet spoke of,
The Angel came with a 
   Shout,
The mountain shook as 
   His Voice cried out,
""Time is no more,"" loud and 
   clear the Shout went forth,

Have you considered the 
    end-time Message?
Have you considered 
     Malachi 4?
Revelation 10:7 and 
    St. Luke 17 
Proclaims this Message now, 
    and then forevermore."
651;The Great I AM;Ab;"I AM that spoke to Moses in 
the burning bush of fire
I AM the God of Abraham, the
Bright and Morning Star.
I AM the Rose of Sharon, from 
beginning whence I came;
I AM the whole creation, and 
Jesus is My Name.

CHORUS
Oh, who do you say I am, and 
whence do you say I came,
Do you know the Father, and 
can you tell His Name?
In Jesus dwells the fullness of 
the Godhead, don't you see;
Jesus is the great I AM, and the 
Lord of lords is He.

I AM was before old Abraham, 
""He rejoiced to see MY day."" .
When Jesus spoke these 
precious words, they stoned 
Him right away.  
""Why do you stone Me?"" Jesus 
said, in a holy, sweet command.
""Because you say you're the 
great I AM, we believe you're
just a man  

It was on the Day of Pentecost, 
oh, how the fire did fall;
The Holy Ghost descended 
and filled them one and all.
Then Peter told the multitude, 
""Repent of all your sins.""
About three thousand souls
were buried in Jesus' 
precious Name."
653;The Pearly White City;Eb;"There's a holy and beautiful city,
Whose builder and ruler is God.
John saw it descending from heaven
When Patmos, in exile, he trod;
Its high, massive wall is of jasper,
The City itself is pure gold;
And when my frail tent here is folded,
Mine eyes shall its glory behold.

chorus
In that bright city', pearly white city,
I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown;
Now I am watching, waiting and longing,
For the white city John saw coming down.

No sin is allowed in that city,
And nothing defiling nor mean;
No pain and no sickness can enter,
No crape on the doorknob is seen;
Earth's sorrows and cares are forgotten,
No tempter is there to annoy;
No parting words ever are spoken,
There's nothing to hurt and destroy.

No heartaches are known in that city,
No tears ever moisten the eye,
There's no disappointment in heaven,
No envy and strife in the sky;
The saints are all sanctified wholly,
They live in sweet harmony there;
My heart is now set on that city,
And some day its blessings I'll share.

My loved ones are gathering yonder,
My friends, too, are passing away;
And soon I shall join their bright number,
And dwell in eternity's day;
They're safe now in glory with Jesus,
Their trials and battles are past;
They overcome sin and the tempter,
They've reached that fair city at last."
654;The Sheep Of His Pasture;F;"The sheep of His pasture 
    have gathered
To hear what the 
    Shepherd would say,
His voice like the sound 
     of slow waters,
Came rippling through 
     vessels of clay.

'Tis the voice that brought 
    forth creation
And set all the stars in 
    array,
And speaks words of Life 
    and of wisdom,
In the midst of His people 
    today.

Through prophets, by 
  precious blood purchased,
Cleansed and surrendered 
    and filled.
And set in the Body for 
   service,
As the Head of the Body 
    hath willed."
655;The Sun, Never Go Down;F;"The sun, it will never go 
   down, in that city,
The sun, it will never go
     down;
The flowers are blooming
     forever,
And the sun, it will never 
      go down.

I feel like travelling on, 
    I do,
I feel like travelling on;
The flowers are blooming 
     forever,
And the sun, it will never 
    go down.

I feel like shouting, 
    sometimes I do,
I feel like shouting, 
    I do;
The flowers are 
     blooming forever,
And the sun, it will never 
   go down."
656;There's A Great Day Coming;G;"There's a great day coming, 
     a great day coming,
There's a great day coming 
     by and by, 
When the saints and the 
     sinners shall be parted
       right and left,
Are you ready for that day
      to come?.

CHORUS
Are you ready? are you 
    ready?
Are you ready for the 
    judgment day?
Are you ready? are you
     ready?
For the judgment day?

There's a bright day coming, 
    a bright day coming,
There's a bright day coming 
    by and by, 
But its brightness shall only 
    come to them that love 
     the Lord,
Are you ready for that day to 
     come?

There's a sad day coming, a 
     sad day coming,
There's a sad day coming by
     and by, 
When the sinner shall hear 
     his doom,""Depart, I know 
     ye not,""
Are you ready for that day to 
   come?"
657;They Come;Eb;"They come from the East and West,
They come from the lands afar,
To feast with the King, to dine as His guests;
How blessed these pilgrims are!
Beholding His hallowed face
Aglow with light divine;
Blest partakers of His grace,
As gems in His crown to shine.


Chorus
Since Jesus has set me free,
I'm happy as heart can be;
No longer I bear the burden of care,
His yoke is so sweet to me.
My soul was as black as night,
But darkness has taken flight;
Now I shout the victory,
For Jesus has set me free.


I look on the great white throne,
Before it the ransom'd stand;
No longer are tears, no sorrow is known
Nor death in that goodly land.
My Saviour has gone before,
Preparing the way for me;
Soon we'll meet to part no more
Through time or eternity.


The gates of that holy place
Stand open by night and day;
O look to the Lord who ""giveth more grace,""
Whose love has prepared the way.
A home in those mansions fair
His hand hath reserved for all.
For the wedding feast prepare,
Obeying the gracious call.


Oh, Jesus is coming soon,
Our trials will then be o'er.
What if our Lord this moment should come
For those who are free from sin?
Then would it bring you joy,
Or sorrow and deep despair?
When our Lord in glory comes,
We'll meet Him up in the air."
658;Watching You;F;"All along on the road to the 
souls true abode,
There's an Eye watching
you;
Every step that you take, 
this great Eye is awake,
There's an Eye watching
you.

CHORUS
Watching you, 
watching you,
Every day mind the 
course you pursue;
Watching you, 
watching you,
There's an all-seeing 
Eye watching you.

As you make life's great
flight, keep the pathway 
of right,
There's an Eye watching 
you;
God will warn not to go in 
the path of the foe,
There's an Eye watching 
you.

Fix your mind on the goal,
that sweet home of the
soul,
There's an Eye watching 
you;
Never turn from the way 
to the kingdom of day,
There's an Eye watching 
you.

If you steal and cheat and lie
And in the church you testify
There's an Eye, watching you
Every step that you take this 
Great eye is awake
There's an Eye watching you"
659;Wear A Crown;Ab;"Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,

Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown.
And when the battle's over, 
we shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Must I be carried to the skies
On flow'ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

And when the battle's over,

Yes, we shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown!
And when the battle's over,

Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown.
And when the battle's over, 
we shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God'.'

Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown.
And when the battle's over, 
we shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Sure I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord;
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain.
Supported by Thy Word,

And when the battle's over, 
we shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown!

660;When We See Christ;Eb;"Oft times the day seems long, 
    our trials hard to bear;
We're tempted to complain, 
    to murmur and despair;
But Christ will soon appear. 
     to catch His bride away,
All tears forever over, in 
     God's eternal day.

CHORUS
It will be worth it all, when 
    we see Jesus; 
Life's trials will seem so small, 
   when we see Christ;
One glimpse of His dear face, 
   all sorrow will erase,
So bravely run the race till 
    we see Christ.

Sometimes the sky looks dark, 
   with not a ray of light;
We're tossed and driven on, 
   no human help in sight;
But there is One in heaven, 
     who knows our deepest
      care,
Let Jesus solve your problem, 
     just go to Him in prayer

Life's day will soon be o'er, 
    all storms forever past;
We'll cross the great divide, 
     to glory safe at last;
We'll share the joys of heaven, 
     a harp, a home, a crown;
The tempter will be banished, 
     we'll lay our burden down."
661;Where Could I Go?;G;"Living below in this old 
   sinful world,
Hardly a comfort can 
   afford;
Striving alone to face
     temptations sore,
Where could I go but 
    to the Lord?

CHORUS
Where could I go, O
    where could I go?
Seeking a refuge for 
    my soul?
I'm needing a friend to 
    help me in the end,
Where could I go but 
    to the Lord?

Neighbours are kind, I 
   love them every one,
We get along in sweet 
   accord;
But when my soul needs
     manna from above,
Where could I go but to
    the Lord?

Life here is grand with
   friends I love so dear,
Comfort I get from God's 
   own word; 
Yet when I face the 
    chilling hand of death,
Where could I go but to 
    the Lord?"
662;Where We Never Grow Old;Eb;"I have heard of a land on 
the far away strand,
'Tis a beautiful home of 
the soul;
Built by Jesus on high, 
there we never shall die,
'Tis a land where we never 
grow old.

CHORUS
Never grow old, 
never grow old,
In a land where we'll 
never grow old;
Never grow old, 
never grow old,
In a land where we'll 
never grow old.

In that beautiful home where 
we'll never more roam,
We shall be in the sweet by 
and by; 
Happy praise to the King, 
through eternity sing,
'Tis a land where we never 
shall die.

When our work here is done 
and the life-crown is won,
And our troubles and trials are 
o'er,
All our sorrow will end, and our 
voices will blend,
With the loved ones who've 
gone on before."
663;Whiter Than The Snow;Eb;"Blessed be the Fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God;
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Thou I've wandered far from His fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Chorus
Whiter than the snow!
Whiter than the snow!
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that Fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."
664;The Fight Is On;C;"The fight is on, the trumpet sound 
is ringing out,
The cry ""To arms"" is heard afar 
and near;
The Lord of hosts is marching on 
to victory,
The triumph of the right will soon 
appear.

CHORUS
The fight is on, O Christian soldiers,
And face to face in stern array
With armor gleaming, and colors 
streaming,
The right and wrong engage today;
The fight is on, but be not weary,

All the guilt and all the anguish,
Which oppressed my heart within,
He has banished by His presence,
And His blessed kiss of peace
Has assured my heart forever
That his love will never cease.

He is not a  disappointment !
He has healed my body too:
What a tender, mighty Saviour,
There is naught He cannot do !
When on earth He healed diseases
As they touched Him in the throng;
Has he lost His heart of pity ?
Is the risen Christ less strong ?

He is not a  disappointment !
He is coming by and by,
In my heart I have the witness
That His coming draweth nigh.
All the scoffers may despise me,
But He tells me He is coming, 
And no change around may see,
And that's quite enough for me.

He is not a disappointment!
He is all in all to me-
Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer;
The unchanging Christ is He!
He has won my heart's affections,
And He meets my every need;
He is not a disappointment,
For He satisfies indeed."

CHORUS
By and by when the morning comes,
When all the saints of God are gathered 
home,
We will tell the story how we overcome,
For we'll understand it better by and by.

We are often destitutes of the things that 
life demands,
Want of food and want of shelter, thirsty 
Hills and barren lands;
But we're trusting in the Lord, and 
According to His Word,
We will understand it better by and by.

Trials dark on every hand, and we 
cannot understand,
All the ways that God would lead us to
That blessed Promised Land;
But He guides us with his eye and we'll
Follow till we die,
For we'll understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares often take
us unawares,
And our hearts are made to bleed for
Many a thoughtless word or deed,
And we wonder why the test when we
Try to do our best,
But we'll understand it better by and by."

There they found their hearts' 
desire,
Bread and fish upon the fire;
Thus He satisfies the hungry 
all the time.

Soon the Lamb will take His Bride, 
To be ever at His side,
All the host of heaven will 
assembled be;
O, 'twill be a glorious sight, 
All the Saints in spotless white;
And with Jesus they will feast
eternally."
780;Don't Forget Prayer;;"Don't forget the family prayer,
Jesus wants to meet you there;
He will take your every care,
Oh, don't forget the family prayer."
781;Stand On That Rock;;"Crying ""Holy"" unto the Lord,
Crying ""Holy"" unto the Lord,
If I could, I surely would
Stand on that rock where 
   Moses stood."
782;Each Step Of The Way;;"I'm following Jesus,
One step at a time;
I live for the moment,
In His love devine.
Why think of tomorrow,
Just live for today;
I'm following Jesus,
Each step of the way.

The pathway is narrow,
But He leads me on;
I walk in His shadow,
My fears are all gone.
My spirit grows stronger,
Each moment, each day,
For Jesus is leading 
Each step of the way."
783;Get On Board;;"It's the old ship of Zion,
It's the old ship of Zion,
It's the old ship of Zion,
Stay on board, stay on board.

It has landed my old father,
It has landed my old father,
It has landed my old father,
Stay on board, stay on board.

It has landed our dear prophet
It has landed our dear prophet
It has landed our dear prophet
Stay on board, stay on board.

It'll take us all to heaven
It'll take us all to heaven
It'll take us all to heaven
Stay on board, stay on board

It has landed our dear pastor
It has landed our dear pastor

784;He's Coming Again;;"Would you be numbered as
     one of His fold?
Would you be numbered as 
      one of His fold?
Be spotless within, be 
     watching and
Waiting that sight to behold;
He's coming again."
785;I'm Going Through;;"Lord, I have started to walk
in the light,
Shining upon me from 
heaven so bright,
I bade the world and its
follies adieu,
I've started with Jesus and 
I'm going through.

CHORUS
I'm going through, yes,
I'm going through,
I'll pay the price whatever
others do,
I'll take the way with the 
Lord's despised few,
I'm going through, Jesus, 
I'm going through.

Oh there are many who 
start in the race,
But with the light refuse
to keep pace,
Others accept it because
it is new,
But not very many expect 
to go through.

I'd rather walk with Jesus
alone,
Have for a pillow, like Jacob, 
a stone;
Living each moment with His
face in view,
Than shrink from my pathway 
and fail to go through.

O brother, now will you take 
up the cross?
Give up the world and count
it as dross?
Sell all thou hast and give to 
the poor?
Then go through with Jesus and 
those who endure."
786;I'm Overcoming;Bb;"I'm overcoming, I'm 
  overcoming,
I'm overcoming, I'm 
  overcoming,
For I love Jesus, He's 
   my Saviour,
And He smiles and He 
   loves me too."
787;In That City, Lamb Is Light;;"There's a country far beyond 
   the starry sky;
There's a City where there 
    never comes a night;
If we're faithful we shall go 
    there by and by,
It's the City where the Lamp 
    is the light.

Chorus
In that City where the Lamb
   is the light,
The City where there cometh
    no night;
I've a mansion over there, 
   and when free
From toil and care,
I am going where the Lamb   
   is the light.}  x2

Here we have our days of 
   sunshine, but we know
That the sun which shines 
     upon us now so bright
Will be changed to clouds and 
    rain until we go
To that City where the Lamb 
    is the light.

There the flowers bloom 
    forever and the day
Shall be one eternal day 
    without a night;
And our tears shall be forever
     wiped away,
In that City where the Lamb 
     is the light.

Here we have our disappointments 
      all the while,
And our fondest hopes but meet 
    with bitter blight;
Though by night we weep, the 
    morning brings a smile, 
In that City where the Lamb is the 
     light.

Then let sunshine fade, let twilight
     bring its gloom,
Not a shadow can my blissful 
     soul affright;
For I know that up in heaven 
     there is room,
In that City where the Lamb is
     the light."
788;Love Lifted Me;;"I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more;
But the Master of the sea
Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
Now safe am I

Chorus
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could 
help, love lifted me,
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could 
help, love lifted me.

All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I'll cling,
In his blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing,
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul's best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belongs.

Souls in danger, look above,
Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by his love
Out of the angry waves.
He's the Master of the sea,
Billows His will obey;
He your Saviour wants to be;
Be saved today."
790;Oh, Won't You Watch?;Bb;"Oh, won't you watch with
     me one hour,
While I go yonder, while I
      go yonder?
 Oh, won't you watch with 
     me one hour, 
 While I go yonder and pray?"
791;THE BEAUTY OF JESUS;Eb;"Let the beauty of Jesus be
    seen in me, 
All His wonderful passion
     and purity;
O Thou Spirit divine, all my
     nature refine,
Till the beauty of Jesus is
     seen in me."
792;Room At The Cross;;"The cross upon which 
     Jesus died
Is a shelter in which we 
     can hide
And its grace so free is 
      sufficient for me
And deep is its fountain; as 
      wide as the sea

CHORUS
There's room at the cross 
    for you
There's room at the cross 
     for you
Though millions have come, 
     there's still room for one
Yes there is room at the cross 
     for you

Though millions have found 
    Him a friend 
And have turned from the sins 
     they have sinned
The saviour still waits to open
     the gate
And welcome a sinner before 
     it's too late

The hand of my Saviour is 
    strong
And the love of my Saviour 
     is long,
Through sunshine or rain, 
     through loss or in gain
The blood flows from Calv'ry 
    to cleanse every stain."
793;Speak My Lord;;"Hear the Lord of harvest 
sweetly calling
""Who will go and work
for Me today?
Who will bring to Me the
lost and dying?
Who will point them to the 
narrow way?""

CHORUS
Speak my Lord, speak 
my Lord
Speak and I'll be quick
to answer Thee;
Speak my Lord, speak 
my Lord
Speak and I'll answer 
""Lord send me""

When the coal of fire 
touched the prophet,
Making him as pure as 
pure can be
When the voice of God, 
said ""Who'll go for us?""
Then he answered, ""Here
I am send me.""

Millions now in sin and 
shame are dying
Listen to their sad and 
bitter cry
Hasten, brother hasten 
to the rescue
Quickly answer ""Master 
here I am""

Soon the time for reaping 
will be over;
Soon we'll gather for the
harvest home;
May the Lord of harvest 
smile upon us,
May we hear His blessed 
""Child well done."""
794;The Circuit Rider;;"The circuit rider preacher went 
    riding through the land
With a rifle on his shoulder and 
      a Bible in his hand
He told the praire people of a 
      blessed Promised land
As he went riding, singing along

Leaning, leaning 
Leaning on the everlasting arm
Leaning, leaning 
Leaning on the everlasting arm

He preached the coming 
   judgment of fire and brimstone
And a glorious endless Heaven 
     of the justified alone
As he rode across the mountains
     you could hear him sing this song



There is power, power, wonder 
    working power
In the blood of the lamb
There is power, power, wonder
    working power
In the precious blood of the lamb.

His rifle is old and rusty and 
    hanging on the wall
His Bible's worn and dusty and its'
      seldom touched at all;
But his Message from this Bible
    will meet us at Judgment Day
For God's truth keeps marching on.

Glory, glory hallelujah! 
Glory, glory hallelujah! 
Glory, glory hallelujah! 
His truth is marching on"
795;When I See The Blood;;"Christ our redeemer died 
    on the cross
Died for the sinner paid
    all his due;
Sprinkle your soul with the 
    blood of the lamb,
And I will pass , will pass 
   over you.

Chorus
When I see the blood 
When I see the blood 
When I see the blood 
I will pass, will pass over you.

Chiefest of sinners, Jesus 
   will save;
All He has promised, that 
   will He do;
Wash in the fountain opened 
    for sin,
And I will pass, will pass 
    over you.

Judgement is coming, all will
    be there,
Each one receiving justly 
     his due;
Hide in the saving, sin 
   cleansing blood,
And I will pass, will pass 
     over you.

Oh, great compassions! O 
    boundless love!
O loving kindness, faithful 
    and true!
Find peace and shelter 
    under the blood,
And I will pass, will pass 
    over you."
796;Undefiled;;"It's a world of compromise
Standards have lowered
Making lives, so devalued,
Till our moral codes are lost
But in the midst of all the scenes
We have virtues thats within
God wants displayed 
No matter what the cost

CHORUS
Undefiled real pure lives
Walking Holy and upright
Keep the flag flying high 
By living clean and undefiled

And when we walk down 
the streets
All the people that we meet 
Will see we can't be sold out cheap 
We are worth much more
When temptations fall on us
Lets turn and run from evil snares
For our bodies 
are the temple of the Lord

It seems like our species'
fast becoming extinct
Survival in earth's atmosphere
gets harder every day
But the same God who saved my soul
Is more than able to keep us whole
And present us before Christ undefiled."
797;Fountain Open;;"For I will take you 
From the nations 
And bring you to your own land
And I'll be sanctified in you
Before the eyes of man
A new heart will I give you
And place my spirit within
I'll sprinkle clean water upon you
And save you from your sins.

There is a fountain open 
In the house of David
To you who will believe
And there are streams 
   of grace
that's flowing down from
     Calvary
Come now and receive.

And I will pour 
Upon the house of my  chosen one
The spirit of grace and  supplication
And in the day, what a 
     day that will be
A fountain shall be opened up
And we shall be wholly clean

There is a fountain filled 
     with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel's 
    veins
And tell me what can wash 
    away my sins
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
And there's no other  fount I know
But the fountain opened in the house
Of David to you who believe
And there are streams of grace 
     that's flowing down
From Calvary come now and receive"
798;Pledge Allegiance;;"I have heard how Christians long ago
Were brought before a tyrant's throne;
They were told that he would spare their lives
If they would renounce the name of Christ;
But one by one they chose to die
The Son of God they would not deny;
Like a great angelic choir sing,
I can almost hear their voices ring

Chorus
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb,
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honour His command
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb.

Now the years have come,
And the years have gone,
But the cause of Jesus still goes on;
Now the time has come to count the cost,
To reject this world,
To embrace the Cross,
And one by one, let us give our lives,
For the One who died to give us life;
Till the Trumpet sounds on that final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say.

To the Lamb of God,
Who bore my pain,
Who took my place,
Who wore my shame,
I will seek to honour His command;
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb."
799;It's My Desire;;"It's my desire to be like Jesus
It's my desire to be like Him
Though often I have failed Him 
And brought him much shame
It's my desire to live for Him.

Chorus
If you could see where 
Jesus brought me from
To where I am today, 
You would know the reason
why I love Him so,
Now you can take this world's 
wealth and riches,
I don't need these things
It's my desire to live for Him.

It's my desire to help someone 
today
Someone who may have failed 
to see the way
I too was once so lost but I found 
my way to God
It's my desire to live for Him."
800;Abide With Me;Eb;"Abide with me
Fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens Lord 
with me abide
When other helpers fail and 
comforts flee
Help of the helpless Lord 
abide with me.

Swift to His close out life's
little day
Earth's joy grow dim, his 
glories pass away
Change and decay in all 
around I see
Oh thou who changest not 
abide with me.

I need thy presence every 
passing hour
What but thy grace can foil 
the tempter's power
Who like thyself my guide 
and stay can be
Through cloud and rain, 
Lord abide with me.

Hold thou thy cross before 
my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom 
and to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks and 
earth's rain shadows flee
In life and death, Oh Lord 
abide with me."
801;Build My Mansion;;"Just built my mansion next 
   door to Jesus
And tell the angels I'm 
    coming home
It doesn't matter who lives 
    around me
Just hope my mansion sets 
      near the throne

Chorus
I have got a mansion just 
     over the hilltop
In that bright land
Where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder 
I'll nevermore wonder
We'll walk the streets that are
    purest gold

I have no castle nor earthly 
   Kingdom
I know he'll guide me till I 
    get home
My home up yonder, the 
    streets are gold
And I hope my mansion sets
    near the throne."

    I have
Never cease to worship you

Shout to the Lord all the earth let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King
Mountains bow down and seas will roar
At the sound of your name
I sing for joy at the works of your hand
Forever I love you, forever I'll stay
Nothing compares to the promise I have in you"
804;The Honest In Heart;;"The first pull contacted the flesh of men,
But did not reach the soul
The second discerned the honest ones
And the third went back for them
He's promised a second ride
And has returned to prove His word
He's here with us who're honest in heart.x2

Chorus
He's going back for the honest in heart
Who laid down their lives within the sacrifice
He's going back for the honest in heart 
Going back for the honest in heart

By faith Rahab the harlot
Perished not with all the rest
She received the spies with peace
And she was blessed
The token was applied
And even though the walls fell down
(The spies went back for her)
(She was saved) she was honest in her heart.x2

On His way to Jerusalem
He picked up the ones and twos
Blind man Bartemaeus
And little Zacchaeus too
We've seen Him repeated in the bride
As she moves on
He's seeking out all the honest in their heart x2

Our lord so rich in mercy
Even there upon the cross
Love burned deep within His heart
To reach out for the lost
The thief hung at His side
Humbly asked to be remembered 
And in that hour He reached out for an honest one.

Even way down in South Africa
As we've heard it testified 
How the Lord worked things out
He never forgets his own
No matter what condition
He kept His word
He reached out for the honest in the heart x2"

I'll just still away somewhere 
    and pray.

Chorus
I'll just still away
I'll just still away
And I ask my precious Lord 
   to lead the way
I'll just still away
I'll just still away
I'll just still away somewhere

Precious Saviour always hears 
As I'm just praying
And He gives me many

When I try to do my best 
And I fail to pass the test
I'll just still away somewhere

In God I trust to drive away my fears
To fill my heart with His forgiving love

When darkness falls upon me
To give me light and guide me
Through life's raging sea
Becomes a worthless place
I'll be with him above

In God I trust to always hold my hands
And take by his hand
In God I trust"

In the lamb's great book of life

As He spoke that day 
Because His saying was too hard
The seventy went away
Then he turned his Gentile heard
From those who went astray
And said to them that were left
Will you also go away.

Chorus
To whom shall we go
Lord there is no one that I know
That can satisfy this longing deep within
For there is nothing in this life
In this world of toils and strive
So to whom shall we go
There is no one I know but you
 
This mighty King has spoken again
Through the seventh angle's voice
That we might hear the word of God
And by hearing make a choice
Where we stand for God and
Right away will go astray
He speaks today as he did to them.
Will you also go."

In the beautiful Garden of Eden
When God made man and placed him 
Over the earth to have dominion

So God put man into a sleep
And took from his side
One of his ribs close to his heart.
With which he formed his bride
His missing rib had been restored 
His missing rib was in bride form

The Bride has come all dressed in white
A veil she has put on 
She's come to stand at the side of him
Who she was taken from 
His missing rib has been restored
Hi missing rib was in bride form."

After all this life is over 
And our burdens have been lifted 
And we stand upon the mountain 
top so tall
Looking over in that city

After all.

By my self I cannot make it

Just a few more days to labour

Oh children let's all be ready
Heed to all that God commands
Let us obey all His instructions
To enter into the Promised Land

Defeated all our enemies
Do not be fearful, just be courageous
He is the leader as we march to victory"

 His hand for me,
I was lost and undone, 
 without God or His Son,
When He reached down 
 His hand for me, for me

I was nearing despair, 
 when He came to me there
And He showed me 
 that I could be free,
Then He lifted my feet,  
 gave me glory complete,
When He reached down 
 His hand for me, for me.

How my heart doth rejoice 
 since I made Him my Choice
From the tempest to Him
  now I flee;
Now I lean on His arm, 
 I'm secure from all harm,
Since He reached down
 His hand for me

Since the Lord gave me peace, 
 heavenly joys never cease;
Lord I give all my life unto Thee;
Guide my feet, hold my hand, 
 grant with Thee I may stand,
For you reached down 
 Your hand for me."
860;Old Rugged Cross;;"On a hill far away
Stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering
 and shame
And I love that old cross
Where the Dearest and Best
For a world of lost sinners
 was slain

Chorus
So I'll cherish 
The old rugged cross
Till my trophies
At last I lay down
I will cling to the 
Old rugged cross
And exchange it some day
For a crown

Oh that old rugged cross
So despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction
 for me
For the Dear Lamb of God
Left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In the old rugged cross
Stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see.
For 'twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me.

To the old rugged cross
I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach
 gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day
To my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share"

Cease to roam
And lean for succour
On his breast
Till He conduct

No more my
Steps shall roam
With Him I'll brave
Death's chilling tide
And reach my

And prayed to the Lord
And He delivered me

And live by His commands
I know the Lord will fix it for me (x2)"
905;Jesus Christ Is The More;;"You're searching for something
        you can't find in this world
You've walked in all the places 
       you know for peace down in your heart
I can see in your eyes the questions
       you've asked before 
Isn't there more, something more?

Chorus
And I have found the Lord 
    you've been searching for.
I have found true peace and real joy
He's a treasure that this world 
    does not contain
Jesus Christ He's the more 
 you're searching for.


He said if you would seek for
     Him with all your heart And soul
Then He would be found of you,  
you could know that you know
And your loneliness He will replace 
with a union you've known.
Yes there's more He's so much more.


Last verse -Chorus

I have found the Lord you've
     been searching for.
I have found true peace and real joy
He's a treasure that this 
world does not contain
Jesus Christ He's the more 
you're searching for.
Jesus Christ He's the more 
you're searching for."
906;It Is No Secret;;"The chimes of times rings
 out the news, 
""Another day is through""
Someone slipped and fell
Was that someone you?
You may have tried for
 added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
For I have news for you

Chorus
It is no secret what God
 can do,
What He has done for
 others
He'll do for you
With arms wide open
 He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God
 can do

There's no night for in His sight 
    you'll never walk alone
Always feel at home wherever
    you may roam 
There is no power to conquer you
    while God is on your side
Just take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide."
907;Just Anyday Now;;"Each time I stop and take a 
time to look around me
I see the signs of His 
appearing everywhere
The things He said would come
to pass are now before us
And I feel a strange excitement
in the air.

Chorus
Just anyday now our Lord 
is coming
He'll be returning for you and me
Oh I've been watching and 
I've been waiting 
Just anyday His face I'll see.

There has this longing in my 
heart of His appearing
I gladly leave behind each 
trial here below.
For this journey has been 
long and I'm so weary
But somehow I feel I'm so 
much closer home."
908;One Day At A Time;;"I'm only a human, I'm just a man
Lord help me believe in what 
I could be and all that I am
Show me the stairway I have to climb
Lord for my sake teach me take 
One day at a time

Chorus
One day at a time sweet Jesus
That's all I'm asking from you
Just give me the strength to do 
    everyday what I have to do 
Yesterday is gone sweet Jesus
Tomorrow may never be mine
Lord help me today show me the 
   way one day at a time

Do you remember when you 
    walked amongst man?
Well Jesus you know, if you look 
     here below it's worse now than then.
Push in and show them, 
    and work in my mind
Lord for my sake teach me to take
One day at a time."
909;I'd Like To Talk It Over With Him;;"Some morning when I stand 
in God's wonderful city
Where the light from heaven's 
glory will never grow dim
Then I'll shake hands with the 
Saviour who gave me life eternal
And I'd love to talk it over with Him.

Chorus
I'd love to kneel down and talk 
it all over with Him
I'd love to say Lord, you loved 
me when my path was so dim
I cannot repay Him when I meet
Him in that city of gold 
Lord I'd love to talk it over 
And thank Him for His wonderful love.

We'll be singing Hallelujahs 
forever and ever
For we'll take a cup of gladness
He'll fill to the brim
But I know that I had brought 
Him some deep tears and sorrow
And I'd love to talk it over with Him."
911;I Love Him Too Much;;"When I first heard of Jesus
His love and His Grace
My heart was overwhelmed
To think a King would take my place 
I cried Lord I'll go with you.
Every step of the way
That's all I can do
My debt to repay

Chorus
I love Him too much 
To fail Him now
I love Him too much
To break my bond
For I promised 
The Lord that I would make 
it somehow
And I love Him too much
To fail Him now

When I told Him I loved Him, 
It was so easy to say
But harder to prove, when
 temptation came my way
All my good unbroken promises 
I counted it but lost
When I caught a glimpse of true love
Hanging on a rugged cross

And now the years have drawn us closer
My love for Him has grown
Each step has brought me near, 
to my eternal home
And now its too close to Heaven 
to turn back now
He said His Grace would be sufficient
I'm gonna make it somehow."
912;I Want To Live;F;"There's been times when giving 
 and loving brought pain,
And I promised I could never 
 let it happen again,
But I found out that loving 
 was worth of the risk,
And that even in losing you win.

	
Chorus
I want live the way 
 He wants me to live,
I want give until there's 
 just no more to give,
I want to love, love till 
 there's just no more love,
I could never, ever 
 out love the Lord.

He showed us that only 
 through dying we live,
And He gave when it seems 
 there was nothing to give,
He loved, when loving brought
 heartaches and loss,
And He forgave from an 
old rugged cross.

I'm gonna live the way 
 He wants me to live,
I'm gonna give until there's 
 just no more to give
I'm gonna love, love till 
 there's just no more love
I could never, ever out
 love the Lord."
913;Let Your Word Be Born;;"It was a tiny simple stable
oh bitterly borne
Hardly a place for a King to be born
He didn't choose some place special
To reveal His majesty
So I know if I'll give Him control
He'll be borne in me

CHORUS
Let your word be born in 
a manger of my heart
Let it live in me let it start
Live inside this house of clay
And mold it everyday
Let your word be borne in a
manger of my heart


Well, outwardly I'm nothing
Not much to behold
Unlikely a place for His
word to unfold
But if I just yield this vessel
And let Him have His way
From glory unto glory
He'll change me day be day."
914;You Don't Need To Understand;;"Life is like a mighty sea so
tossed and driven
Billows rise within the heart of
every man
Storms so many times will leave 
the hearts with questions
You don't need to understand 
just hold His hand

CHORUS
You don't need to understand
You just need to hold His hand
You don't have the need to ask 
the reason why
For I know He'll make a way
Through the night and through the day
You don't need to understand, 
just hold His hand

When my life down here is through 
one day He'll call me
To my home up there
upon the golden shore
He will then review the past
that lays behind me
And I won't need to 
understand just anymore"
915;I Have Found A Precious Friend;;"I have found a precious friend 
 and Jesus is His name
He's the one the bible tells us
He heals the blind the sick and lame 
And since, I found this friend I
 have never been the same
All I know I wanna do is to glorify His name


Many times when I'm in trouble 
I call upon His name
And He has never been too busy 
He just listens again
Then He sends living waters to 
 flow from deep within
Making it easy to forget how 
 troubled I have been

And when I talk to Him in 
 prayer everyday,
He listens patiently to every 
 word I have to say,
He will never, no never ever turn me away
Cause He is my best friend 
 and will be unto the end
Oh yes He is my best friend and 
 will be unto the end"
916;Thank You Lord For Your Blessings On Me;;"As the world looks upon us
As we struggle along
They say we have nothing
But they are so wrong
In my heart I'm rejoicing
How I wish they could see
Oh thank you Lord for your
 blessings on me

Chorus
I have a roof up above me
I've a good place to sleep
There's food on my table
And there's shoes on my feet
You gave me your love Lord
And a fine family
Oh thank you Lord for blessings
 on me

I know I'm not wealthy
And these clothes are not new
I don't have much money
But Lord I have you
And to me that solves the matter
Though the world may not see

918;What A Beautiful Day For The Lord To Come Again;;"As I woke up in the morning
Of each day that passes by
And I listen to the sound upon my ears
I can hear and keep a watch, towards the eastern  
sky
And I wonder if the trumpet will be next sound that I hear.

Chorus
What a beautiful day for the Lord to come again;
What a beautiful day for him to take his children 
Home
How I long to see his face and to touch his nail scarred hands
What a beautiful day for the Lord to come again.

All my earthly disappointments, and my trial that I 
have  
Fade away when I remember his last words
He said He'd come and receive the children unto 
Him
And I'm longing just to look upon the face of my Lord"
919;Lost One Don't Roam;;"Have you stumbled in the darkness
The light you cannot see
You've strayed far from the
Shepherd
Thinking you would be free
And now you're lost and lonely
You ought to cry Lord, save me
Lost one don't roam
Just you come home

Chorus
Oh lost one come home
the Shepherd's waiting for you
Waiting and watching
What you gonna do
Outside it's dark and cold
Won't you come back to the fold
Lost one don't roam
Just you come home

Yes He knows you're unhappy
And all about your fears
And how he wants to save
And wipe away each tear
To Him you are so precious
He wants to keep you so near 
Lost one don't roam
Just you come Home"
920;I Love You Lord;;"All the treasures on earth
could never repay
What Jesus has done for me
That's the way God the father
Had planned it to be
When He sent His only son
to rescue me
And I can never repay
But I can just, say Lord I love thee


Chorus
I love you Lord although I'm not
worthy
I'm not worthy for the price you 
paid for me
And I could never repay
But I can just say Lord I love Thee

Why He loved me so
I really don't know
But I know He cares for me
Oh and I had never known
The love that He had shown
When He died upon the cross
for worthless me
And I could never repay
But i can just say 
Lord I love thee"

How a Saviour came from glory
How He gave His life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning,
Of His precious Blood's atoning,
Then I repented of my sins 
And won the victory.

Chorus
O victory in Jesus
My Saviour, forever
He sought me and bought me;
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, ""Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit,""
And somehow Jesus came and brought
To me the victory

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there
The song of victory."

Safe am I within the castle
Of God's Word retreating,
Nothing then can reach me

Their cry cannot alarm me,
I am safely sheltered here,
Protected by God's hand;
Here the sun is always shinning,
Here there's naught can harm me

Viewing here the works of God,

Hearing now His blessed voice,

Gladly will I tarry

And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not your heart,
Be saved, oh, tonight.

Chorus
Oh, why not tonight?
Oh, why not tonight?
Wilt thou be saved?
Then why not tonight?

Tomorrow's sun may never rise
To bless thy long-deluded sight;
This is the time, oh, then be wise,
Be saved, oh, tonight.

Our Lord in pity lingers still,
And wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at once thy stubborn will,
Be saved, oh, tonight.

Our blessed Lord refuses none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Believe on Him, the work is done,
Be saved, oh, tonight."

By the speed that we've been making
I would say there is no mistaking
That over the next hill we'll be Home

And over the next hill we'll be Home

When we get there we're certain
That we'll find the gate is open
There will be a refuge from the

For the way's been long and weary
For the Bride that's been preparing
And over the next hill we'll be Home."

He was smiling as he came

CHORUS
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I had a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

And he said friend 
You may not know me now
Then He said but wait
You used to teach my sunday school
I was only eight
Every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
One day as you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart

Then another man stood before you
He said remember the times
A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave 
That's why I'm here today

One by one they came
For as the eye could see
Each life somehow touched by your generosity
Little things that you have done
Sacrifices made
Unnotice on the earth
In heaven now proclaim

I know up in heaven 
You are not suppose cry
But I know they were tears in your eye
As Jesus took your hand
You stood before the Lord
He said my child look around you
Great is your reward"

As the blood and water from
His body came

CHORUS
He could called an angel then 
To unbind His feet and hands
Restore the wounds 
 and let Him go free
But the pain and disgrace 
Should have been mine
But He took my place
And I know He did it all for me

I saw the look upon face
Oh the pain and disgrace
As the heart of my Saviour 
Broke with grief
I saw stripes He bore for me
As He worked on Calvary
And I know He did all for ME


I saw the dark and empty tomb
I saw Mary filled with gloom
She thought that they
Had taken her Lord away
Then a voice spoke sweet and clear
That it removed all doubt and fear
Jesus Christ had risen up 
 from out of the grave

And though He had to go away 
He will return again some day
To take us home eternaly
Now salvation is complete
Death has settled great defeat
And I know He did it all for ME"

I was on His mind.

The Scriptures tell the Story
Of Enoch long ago
Who walked with God and was not
Yet no-one seemed to know
That he had been translated
For death he did not see
And walked off with our Saviour
Into Eternity.

One day God's servant Moses
Obeying God's command
Went up the distant summit
To view the Promised Land
The people in the valley
Beheld his face no more
For he had gone forever
To Heaven's Eternal Shore

When God did take Elijah
From troubles here below
Up to his Home in Glory
Eternal rest to know
He sent the weary prophet
A Chariot of Flame
And lifted him to Heaven
Oh, Glory to His Name!

When God did send His Prophet
Br' Branham here below
To start a Great Revival
All o'er the earth to go
And then the Seventh Angel
His message did proclaim
To take us into Glory
Let's Magnify His Name!"

Lord I do believe.

Lead me Lord, I will go
You have called me,

 although at times I feel alone
I know that You are near 
My heart just wants to follow
I'm willing to obey
Take my hand and lead me
I'll follow all the way.

What did they think, those men so fierce?
Victor alone, of Calvary,
The dearest Price, would set us free.
Just as He said, as it was wrote,
He did descend, and death was smote.
Early that day, the Sharon Rose, 
Fresh with the dawn, brought soul repose.
He has a home, for you and I,
Whose glory fills, both earth and sky.
The Lord of Life, would call to thee.
List'to His Voice, from death be free."

Through Him I must win

Chorus
Oh, I want to see Him
Look upon His face
There to sing forever
Of His saving grace;
On the streets of Glory
Let me lift my voice
Cares all past, home at last
Ever to rejoice

When in service for my Lord,
Dark may be the night,
But I'll cling more close to Him
He will give me light
Satan's snares may vex my soul,
Turn my thoughts aside;
But my Lord goes ahead,
Leads whatever betide

When in valleys low I look
Toward the mountain height
And behold my Saviour there,
Leading in the fight
With a tender hand outstretched
Toward the valley low;
Guiding me, I can see
As I onward go.

When before me billows rise
From the mighty deep
Then my Lord directs my bark
He doth safely keep
And He leads me gently on
Through this world below
He's a real friend to me
Oh, I love Him so."

When the choir has sung its last song and the 
 preacher has said his last prayer,
When the people have heard their last sermon 
and the sound has died out in the air.
When the Bible lies closed on the altar 
and the pews are all empty of folks,
And each one stands facing his record 
and the great Book is opened - What then?

When the actors have played their last drama 
and the mimic has made his last fun,
When the film has flashed its last film 
and the billboard displayed its last run,
When the crowds seeking pleasure have vanished 
and all liquor stores and beer joints have been closed.
And the salesman sold his last dring
 and gone out in the darkness,
When the trumpet of ages is sounded 
and we stand before Him - What Then?

When  the bugle call sinks into silence 
and the long marching columns stand still,
And the captain repeats his last orders, 
and the flag has been hauled from the mast,
And the wounded afield checked in 
 and a world that rejects its Saviour is 
asked for a reason - What then"

I know there shall be a change
From mortal to immortality

Blooming in their youth hugging me
Said ""welcome our dear and precious brother
This is heaven the land of perfect love
Then stood a beautiful young sister
She was ninety when i led her to Christ

Somewhere just beyond the river jordan
Is a land of joy and peace
Splendor no eyes has ever seen
Beauty no mind can comprehend
Oh we are looking for a city
Whose builder and maker is God

Often we are tossed and we are driven
On the restless sea of life
Often our hearts are burdened
By the cares that this life demands
Oh but we are going to a city
Where sorrow and pain will never be"

I felt sorry honest I do,
So I just cried and said, ""Forgive me Lord,
Forgive me again, will you.""

Chorus
Justified, justified
You have not done it in the first place
you're justified
Justified, justified
You have not done it in the first place

So often I'm discouraged
When I count the times I fall
'Cause He promised I'd be victorious
When I knew I'm not at all
Then I heard an eagle scream,
It's voice quickened my soul
He said ""You've not done it in the first
 place, you're justified.""

He Looked at a perfect picture
Without blame, spot or wrinkle
He didn't look at you where you are now,
He looked down from Eternity
He said you're just trapped in that body
You bypassed your Theophany:
You have not done it in the first place,
you're justified"

To take that heavenly flight

We'll receive salvation for our souls

In the image of the word
United with theophany
We'll be one with the living God

1201;Cow Boy's Meditation;;"Last night as I laid
 on the prairie
I gazed to the stars
 in the skies
And I wondered if
 ever a cowboy
Could drift to that
 sweet bye and bye

There is a road to that bright,
 happy Region
But it's dim there,
 a trail , so they say,
But the broad one that
 leads to perdition
Is posted and blazed all the way.

They speak of another
 great Owner,
And He's never overstocked,
 so they say
He'll always make
 room for a sinner
That will drift on that straight,
 narrow way

They say He'll never
 forsake you,
And He knows every
 action and look;
For safety we'd better
 get branded,
Have our name on
 His great tally Book

For they say there will
 be a great roundup
When cowboys like
 dogies will stand
To be marked by the
 ridders of judgement,
That's posted and
 knows every brand

I guess I wont be a
 stray yearling,
Just a man that's
 condemned to die
That will be cut in the
 bunch with the rustics,
When the Boss of those
 ridders come by."

Of friends and kindred dear

The holy ones behold they come
I hear the heavenly host."

Speak to me gently

Of the prize of my calling

1211;The Great Judgement Morning;C;"I dreamed that the great judgement 
 morning.
Had dawned and thetrumpet had blown
I dreamed that the nations were gathered
To judgement before the white throne
From the throne came a bright shining 
 angel
And stood on the land and the sea
And swore with his hand raised to heaven
That time was no longer to be.

Chorus
And O, what a weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate
They cried to the rocks and the mountains
They prayed but their prayers were too late

The rich man was there but his money
Had melted and vanished away;
A pauper he stood in the judgement,
His debts were too heavy to pay;
The great man was there but his greatness
When death came was left far behind
The angel that opened the records,
Not a trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there and the orphans,
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven for ever, 
God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
The gambler was there and the drunkard ,
And the man that had sold them the drink
With the people who gave them the license.
Together in hell they did sink.

The moral man came to the judgement
But his self-righteous rags would not do;
The men who had crucified Jesus
Had passed off as the moral men, too;
The soul that had put off salvation,
""Not tonight; I'll get saved by and by,
No time now to think of religion
At last they had found time to die"

May hide the light of day

Matches day and night

And just a little talk with

1242;O God Our Help In Ages Past- Mwari Mubatsiri Wangu;;"O God, our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come
Our shelter from the stormy blast
And our eternal home

Under the shadow of thy throne
Still may we dwell secure
Sufficient is thine arm alone
And our defense is sure

Before the hills in order stood
Or earth received her frame
From everlasting thou art God
To endless years the same

A thousand ages in thy sight
Are like an evening gone
Short as the watch that 
 ends the night
Before the rising sun.

Time like an ever rolling stream
Bears all its sons away
They fly forgotten as a dream
Dies at the opening day

O God our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come
Be thou our guide while life shall last
And our eternal home"

That though we part from friends on earth
We all shall meet in heaven

Chorus
We all shall meet in heaven at last
We all shall meet in heaven
Through faith in Jesus` precious Blood
We all shall meet in heaven

When gathered in the blessed name
Of Christ the Father`s Son
And though the parting soon may come
Yet in His Word is given
The blessed hope that by and by
We all shall meet in heaven

Yes, soon our worn and weary feet
Will reach the golden strand
Where those who love our coming wait
In yonder summer land
A few more days, a few more years
By storm and tempest driven
With songs and everlasting joy
We all shall meet in heaven."

Sweet home of the happy and free;
The Haven of rest for the weary,
How beautiful heaven must be.

Up there by the beautiful sea;
Sweet chords from their gold harps 
are ringing.
How beautiful heaven must be.

Pure waters of life there are flowing,
And all who will drink may be free
Rare jewels of splendor are glowing
How beautiful heaven must be.

In heaven no drooping nor pining
No wishing for elsewhere to be;
God's light is forever there shining,
How beautiful heaven must be."

The dry bones becoming as flesh
And these are the days of your

Rebuilding the altar of grace
And these are the days of the harvest.
Oh the fields are white in your Word
And we are the labourers in your vineyard

He's always there to listen.
When arms fold without me,

What could I do?

When my tears flow like a river,
And my burdens are high as a mountain
When the ones I've counted on,
Have let me down.

He's the One that I can count on.
I couldn't make it, without Jesus
What could I do?"

And resting on His Goodness
I lose all my cares and all of my fears
For by His Grace He leadeth
Though just one step I may see
His Eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches over me

Whenever I am tempted
Whenever clouds arise
When songs give place to sighing
And hope within me gone
I draw much closer to Him
From cares He sets me free
His Eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches over me"
1260;Once And For All;;"An endless dream of pilgrims
Made a way into Jerusalem
To offer all their goats, their lambs and doves
Atonment for sin was made
But only for a season, and empty hearts to cry
For a lasting desire
And from Bethlehem He came, 
Emmanuel was His name
He knew the world would need a sacrifice
And a millionaire could never pay the price

Chorus
Once and for all, He walked the road to Calvary
Carrying the sins of everyman upon His shoulders
Once and for all He conquered death victoriously
Tearing down the separating wall
And the price was paid in full
Once and for all

An endless stream of mercy, 
falls like rain from Heaven's Holy Throne
To everyone who calls upon His Name
Though we all were sinners, 
He loved beyond our weaknesses
Although we were unworthy, 
He came to suffer in our place
And as His Blood fell on the ground, 
a hope again was found
No longer are we guilty and depressed
For he has thrown our sins as far as east 
is from the west"

Is living on my mind

Lately all, I got is living on my mind
It seems thats all I'm thinking about
So much of the time
How that soon and very soon
I'll leave my troubles all behind
And lately I got with me 
 is living on my mind

I guess I should be looking for 
A better place to live
But I can't seem to get excited 
about this world
And all it has to give
I couldn't care less if I could ride
 on with a solitary dime
For what could hold this world to me
With the rapture on my mind"
1262;Can't Even Walk;;"I thought, that number one
 would surely be me

On life's sinking sand

Without You holding my hand

Chorus
Lord I can't even walk
Without you holding my hand
The mountain is too high
And the valley is too wide
Down on my knees
I've learnt to stay
Cause I can't even walk 
Without you holding my hand

I thought I could do
 a lot on my own
I thought I could make it,
 on my own.
I thought of myself
 as a mighty big man
But I can't even walk
 without You holding my hand

Since I met Jesus
My All in All
From now on when I'm in trouble
On His name I call

Then our lives will be transformed
 into that of Jesus Christ

Chorus
If we dont overcome
How could we be ressurected
We must understand what we've been taught
To come to this place, we must surrender
Our lives completely to Him
Then walk and live with the understanding
Of who we are
Sons and daughters of the Mighty Conquerer
Gentile warriors we must overcome, 
we must overcome

Don't be manipulated by your enermy
If you would really understand 
your true identity
Then you would have constant victory
As a child of God you have full authority

revealed through the opening of 
 the Seventh Seal"

Yet in my weakness He is there
To let me know 

Chorus
His strength is perfect
When my strength is gone
He'll carry us 
 when we can't carry on
Raised in His power, 
the weak become strong
His strength is perfect
His strength is perfect

You can only know 
the Power that He holds
When truely see 
how far our weakness goes
His strength begins to show
When all comes to an end
He hears my humble cry 
and proves again"
1265;I Watched;;"I watched them lead Him down the cobbly road
The cross He bore was such a heavy load
I watched them place a thorny crown on His head
As I heard the people cry out for His death
Then I wondered deep down in my heart just why
That this Man named Jesus Christ had to die
And why He had to die for the souls of man
You see it was part of God's holy plan

I watched them lead Him up the rugged hill
Despised and rejected He went still
Then one pulled from the crowd to bear that tree
For it was His identity to die on calvary
Then I ran ahead just so that I could see
What would happen to this Man from Galilee
And I watched Him hang there until His life was gone
As Mary and others began to weep and mourn

So when Mary came unto the tomb that day
She stood in awe to see the stone rolled away
And as she ran to tell the others what she had seen
For the angel spoke ""He's the risen King""
But then Thomas said 'I will not believe
Except I see His nail scars in His hand and feet""
But then Jesus Christ appeared unto him just then
Said Thomas thrust thy finger in My hands

Said I'm King of Kings
 and I'm the Lord of Lords
My works will not return unto me void
Said I go away to prepare a place for you 
That where I am you might come too

So go out and preach this gospel to all man
Tell them how I suffered for their sin
 and be ye not dismayed I'll return some day
To catch this waiting bride away
So come buy without money, without prize,
Your redemption has been paid for eternal life
So on the Word of God there you must stand
See I've engraven you in the palms of my hands"

They took the prophet John 
and boiled Him in oil to die.
He had a true connection

He said its not so hard to die 
when you can see your home.

Steven full of faith and power

In His own image, formed from His own hand

God had to find a sacrifice
To die once and for all x 2
So He sent His Son to die, all the pain He bore
they laid Him in a borrowed tomb
A stone held fast the door
Saints now tell the story
I'm about to tell, about a conversation
From the pits of hell x 2

Tell me death tell, tell me
Oh death hear my plea (haha)
Do you still have Jesus or did you set Him free
You see this is now the first day
Since we laid Him in the ground (haha)
Tell me oh death tell me
Can you pull Him down I say,
Can you pull Him down

Satan oh satan, satan hear me well
I promise oh I promise
That I shall not fail no, that I shall not fail

Tell me death tell me
This is the second day (haha)
Do you still have Jesus or 
Did He get away I say
Did he get away

Satan oh satan, hear now once more
the greatest kings and rich man
Have walked through my dark door
And this Jesus He's not perfect
For He's just a mortal man
And I make this vow to you
He wont escape my hand no
He wont escape my hand

Tell me death tell me
Tell me don't be slow
Do you still have Jesus or
Did you let Him go
You see He's been dead for three days
The victory's been won
It's time for celebration
We've overcome God's Son x 2

Satan oh satan, listen
Hear me what I say
This morning Oooooh this morning
The stome was rolled away
I just couldn't stop Him
I couldn't hold Him down

He rose up from the dead

He has risen, He has risen
Oh death where is your sting
He has risen, He has risen
Proclaim Him King of kings
He has risen, He has risen
He lives for ever more

1271;The Lord Is My Shepherd;;"He leads me besides the still waters

And He leads me beside the quiet stream

Chorus
Your rod and your staff, they comfort
In the presence of my enermies
And I will live in Your house my Lord
Forever and ever

Even though I walk through the valley of death
I will not, I will not, be afraid.
For you fill my cup to overflowing
You annoint my head with oil
Your goodness and mercy 
Shall be with me all my life
And you help me to do
What honours You the most"
1272;A Supernatural Place;;"Lazarus heard a voice
Though dead in the tomb
And Samuel, heard the same voice 
Though yet a boy.
We read of Moses and Paul
Who were changed in their ways
They heard the voice of God
From a supernatural place

Chorus
Into a supernatural place
Hearing God's voice, seeing His face
Heavenly Words of light
Have shown on the bride
Oh, what a reflection
Of glory and grace! what a reflection
Of glory and grace

In the dark of night
God sent a light, to quicken us
By the rising of the Son
Our gloom is passed away,
We are looking at the day
Through eyes that see
A supernatural place"
1274;In Death There's Victory;;"Up the hill, with the load
Jesus walked up Calvary's road
No man took His life from Him
It was for us that He willingly gave
In His mind He held a vision
It was of the resurrection
And truly He paid death's price
Our victory's complete
In the perfect sacrifice,
From this we sing,

Chorus
In death, in death, in death
There's victory
Self-sacrifice, means freedom
And this is the way for me
For the joy set before
There's a cross to endure
For real life, this I see
That in death there's victory

Abraham, held the promise,
In Isaac shall Thy Seed be called
And he died to his own thinking,
When God told him sacrifice his boy
Obedient unto death he was faithful
Knowing resurrection was in the end
This he said, ""The lad and I,
We'll go worship 
and we'll come to you again""
So we can sing

O, tell me now, Bride of Christ
We're not different we must pay the price
As we lift up our cross
Though we suffer and our lives are lost
Yet we must die to ourselves and sin,
Truly become a burnt-offering.
But it's sure in the end,
That we will rise again
Now we can sing"
1275;Will You Marry Me;;"In choosing of a Bride
I want someone by my side
Who will cherish and obey
 my every word.
To believe in me
And know that I will faithfull be
If you want to be one with me
Answer please

Chorus
Will you marry me?
I'll take you home with me
I have a place prepared for you
You won't believe
The tree of life is there
Flowers blooming everywhere
But best of all, we'll be together
Eternally

Greater love was never known
That Christ would leave His own
And choose a bride from the gentile race
And He said, ""Whosoever will,
Let him come and I will give,
If you want to forever live
answer please"".

Christ is the Mystery
Now revealed in you and me
King of kings and Lord of lords
His Name is called the Word of God
Christ is the Mystery"
1276;Before We Say Good-bye;;"Before we say ""Good-bye""
Can we tell you that we love you
And that we're praying for you
As you journey all this way
Together we share this song
And the Word the Lord has given
We shall not all sleep
In eternity we'll meet, it's His promise

We are members of a family
Jesus Christ has called us His own
From His table we're feasting
And in each other, we love to confide
By His Word we're bound together
We see Christ as we look on each face
We're so proud to be part of His Body
Partakers of unmerited grace"
1277;Deep In The Night;;"Deep in the night
the angels were heard
Singing sweet melody

Celebrating the birth of a King

Chorus
And the angels declared His glory
The heavens light we proclaim
We shall see Him in all of His splendor
We shall behold the King

He gave His life leaving a promise
Of hope to all who believe
Even in death He showed us His glory
Reaching out to set captives free

Soon time shall cease
Ending all sorrows
Broken hearts will never grieve
All man shall bow down
Confessing His glory
Proclaiming Him King of all kings"
1278;The Holy Hills;C;"The Holy Hills of Heaven call me
To mansions bright, across the sea
Where loved ones wait
And crowns are given
The Hills of Home, are calling me

Chorus
This house of flesh, is but a prison
Bars of bones, hold my soul.
But the doors of clay
One day will burst wide open
When the angels set my spirit free
I'll take my flight, like a mighty eagle
When the Hills of Home, start calling me.

I see loved ones over yonder
Their tears are gone
And their hearts are free
And from the throne
My Saviour beckons
And the Hills of Home
Start calling me"
1279;Different Sound;;"We hear about the wars,
See famine in the lands
There's questions in the children's hearts
Trouble in the east again
The whole world is shaking
There's no sure place to stand
And mornful sounds are heard 
Throughout the land

But I keep listening 
For a different sound
The sound of the party that
John saw coming down
The sound of the Bride
Being united with the Groom
I keep listening x 3
For a different sound

I remember the preacher saying
""Son it shall come to pass,
There will come a generation
That will be the last""
I can't believe we are standing here
Seeing the end of time
And the preacher's voice
Echoing in my heart

I keep listening for a different sound
The sound of the city that John saw 
 coming down.
The sound of the Bride being united with the lamb
The sound of the chorus singing glory to the Lamb
I keep listening x 3
For a different sound"
1280;Eagle's Cry;;"All my life
I searched for the truth
I struggled deep inside,
I knew this life, just wouldn't do
There was no comfort
Found in man's philosophy
I felt so out of place
But His wondrous Word 
I had to know.

Chorus
And then an eagle screamed
""Child come out of her,
I'll take you in my arms
and lead you to the Word.
Come on and spread your wings,
I'll teach you how to fly"".
I've been so happy since
I heard God's eagle cry.

There I was in a nest of unbelief
Another empty heart
Was really all I could see.
I needed something fresh
To feed my hungry soul
I knew there must be more
Of his word in store for me"
1281;When It Hurts;C;"When it hurts so bad
Oh why don't you give it to Jesus?
He can heal your troubled heart
He can mend the pain
 that binds you

Chorus
Jesus loves you so
And he wants you to know
He loves you so
He's the healer of your soul

As you feel the spirit moving
Deep within your heart
Like a Sheperd He will lead you
Back into His fold.

It's the hand of the man 
 that once saved you,
Thats reaching out right now
His tears of joy will cleanse you.
As you come to you right now
The balm of His love 
 will surround you.
He'll never let you down"
1282;The Good Sheperd;D;"Another Mighty Angel of Rev 10
Has come down to live within
To lead us to that perfect land
I'm glad the Good Shepherd
He knows the way

Chorus
I love the Good Shepherd
And He loves me
He gave His Life on Mt. Calvary
And there's not a thing
In this world below 
That I'd rather have
Than the Shepherd I know

It's good to be living
In Canaan's fair land
For that's the purpose
Of The Son of Man
To give us life Etarnally
I'm glad the Good Shepherd
Gave His life for me"
1283;Life Story;;"In 1909 in a lonely old cabin,
A baby was born with a sign on the head
The Pillar of fire came down that day
And whilded through the window
In the room where he lay
As he grew a little older his parents told him
About the mysterious light that came in

Chorus
Alone and forsaken 
By friends and by man
Till an Angel came down
So he could understand
He was God's chosen man

One day he was resting
Beneath an old old tree
When he noticed a whirlwind
rustling the leaves.
He thought nothing strange 
but when he started to go
A big voice came forth and here is
 is what it said
""Don't drink nor smoke
Defile your body in any way,
I've got a work for you latter
I'll show you some day"".

At the age of seven 
God showed him a vision
About a bridge being built
and later was fulfilled
On the Ohio River where the 
bridge now stands .
There was a mysterious light 
that came down that day.
As he baptised the 17th person that day
Thousands were there to witness that day

Now the story I've told you I know 
there is more.
It was the fulfilment of Malachi 4
Now if there is a doubt
In your mind that you have
Don't check it from me
Check it out in the Word
With an open heart God will 
show that man.
That William Branham 
is this man's name"
1284;Never A Man;A;"Jesus went to the temple
When He was only twelve
His Words to the elders
And His wisdom they beheld
And the multitude  that followed
To hear the Man from Galilee
Never a man spake like
this Man, when He said
""Come follow me""

Chorus
Never a man spake like this Man
The glorious King of kings
He spoke to my troubled soul
And now my heart sings
He has promised in His Holy Word
Someday His face I'll see
Never a man spake 
like this Man, when he said
""Come follow me"".

He calmed the troubled waters
With the few Words that He spake
The lame walked, the dumb talked
When He said to them, ""Be healed""
And Lazurus came forth from the grave
When he heard the Master speak
Never a man spake like this Man
When He said come follow me"

Are everywhere
Theres a brand new
Feeling in the air
Just lift you eyes
Towards the eastern skies
Lift up your hands
Your redemption 
Draweth nigh

Wars and strife on every hand
and violence fills this earth.
And some people still doubt
If He will ever come again
But the Word of God is true
He'll redeem His chosen few
Don't lose hope for soon
Jesus will descend"

This time we'll meet, never to part

And the toils of the road will seem nothing
When I get to the end of the way
And the toils of the road will seem nothing
When I get to the end of the way

Or give me one trial too much,
All His people have been dearly purchased,
And satan can never claim such.

In the city of unending day.
And the toils of the road will seem nothing
When I get to the end of the way
And the toils of the road will seem nothing
When I get to the end of the way.

When the last feeble step has been taken,
And the gates of that city appear,
And the beautiful songs of the angels
Loat out on my listening ear.
When all that now seems so mysterious

Holding my palm in my hand

Chorus
Yes, I am holding my palm in my hand
Holding my palm in my hand
Where the eagles are gathered
Worshipping the Lamb
I am holding my palm in my hand

I am not boasting about much revelation
And I am not boasting about much inspiration
But when I look in and miss Elijah from the scene
I believe and fear, because I know who is here
About two hundred pounds of olive-skin complexion
Pouring out His fulness unto man
Like John, I shout Hallelujah
Holding my palm in my hand

And when I hear God's Holy Word revealing
All the mysteries of Christ the Son of Man
I recognise my day and what the Spirit say
Come out of Laodecia
For the White-horse-rider, will take the hindmost
So come into the royal Holy Ghost
And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come! Come! Come!

And when I feel that Hot Shekinah Glory
Drawing me deeper into Love's veil
And I feel those flames of light
Changing my robes to white
To a place that I could never fail

Then the let winds and the waves and Satan storm
I am holding my palm in my hand"

The life style changed from natural to spiritual
To put away everything that's canal
And the only goal you see is to be perfect just like He
You feel the life growing inside of you

Now the Truth and Way I know
The growth of life in seven steps would show
That its from Faith to Perfect Love
Then God descends like a dove
To crown the man for attaining Perfection

All the while this is what I see
Christ in you is the Mystery
To overcome this human flesh
That's the man that God would bless
Who overcomes I would grant to wear a crown

Saints I'm sure in Heaven is where I'll be
Praising God through Eternity
The Holy Spirit, Christ in me, I am sure of victory

Stir me up Lord,
 let Thy Word flow through me
Stir me up Lord, 
 let Thy fragrance cling to me
Let the full revelation
 of your love govern me
Stir me up, let me be all in Thee

For there is coming an hour 
 when the cries would be useless.
There will be no more Grace,
 no more pardon, no Love
Let me be caught away 
 to my precious Lord
While I remain, stir me up.

When the anointing comes
 as Thy Word goes forth
Let it not be my spirit alone
Let it be all of me deep within my soul
When Thy Word goes in Lord,
 stir me up"

By a simple humble man
Who stood true to God's great plan

 that came out of the dragon's mouth,
Are deceiving all the kings on earth today,
Religious man have been sealed out,
 by the doctrine that came out.
Saying that Jesus Christ Our Lord
 is three indeed.

Seven Spirits of Our God,
Seven Voices Thundering out,
The Seven Virtues of Our God into my soul

The greatest contest now is on.
But by the Spirit's Sword

That my heart is centred on.
He's the One that means
 the most in all my life.

Until His light did shine

I'm not afraid for the Lord my Captain is inside
He'll point the Silver Sword and I'll obey His Word
But the foolish laugh, they can't understand

So here we are so great with Child,
Resting on that Seventh Peak.
Waiting orders from oh High
To exercise the Third Pull our inheritance
But the wicked man can not understand
There cannot be any impersonation

Endure to the end for we know we'll see His face,
Grow in Grace my sisters, let's fulfil all righteousness
For we are flesh of His Flesh and bone of His Bone.

That He the Lamb would be slain
To redeem His creation
He knew that we had fallen
From our lofty heights to sin
So He had to come in flesh and died 
To bring us back to Eden

He came with a Shout
Revealing His Redemption
To claim and call His Bride
From the Powers of deception
So why should we doubt 
That His Words are in our mouth
For He has ordained 
That we must prophecy again
To every nation

We have crossed back the chasm
To our lofty heights
By seven thundering voices

We'll be translated
To His heavenly domain

For Her victory day is nigh

And the New Name that She bears with pride
Once again it will be glorified.

And those waiting Mighty Gentile Warriors
Will rise and join in the victor's march."

He promised through the prophet
I will ride this trail again
Many years have come and gone
Saints what are we waiting on
the truth made plain is here
Riding this trail again."
1376;As I Possess This Land;;"As I continue to possess this land
Lord, let me hold fast this revelation
All along the Way, Lord lead me all the time
For you know this path real good
It is a road you have already trod
And You overcome every temptation,
By your own Word

Chorus
Lord, anoint me more and more
With overcoming inspiration
Seven powerful Thundering Voices
Shuttering every strong temptation
Perfect Faith and confidence
Lord my soul is longing for
Perfect strength in perfect weakness
Lord allow

Lord, I know that this Land is mine
For you have made me to understand
Your Counsel is immutable - You cannot lie
You have restored back all the Word
And Your Promises are assured
Forward in Faith to the objective
As I journey along

Alert and ever watchful, help me to be
As I walk this Land with Thee
Ever spotless may this pure white raiment be
I'm surrendered whole heartedly
Looking for the change to immortality
And I remember how you care and delivered me 

You are the same Jesus that calmed the sea
And you are dwelling now in me
Make me conscious more and more of my ability
Full obedience to Thy Word
Because of love for what You did
Exercising the Faith of God that's locked up in me"
1377;Rise And Shine;;"We lived our past in pleasure realising never
Hidden treasure in our souls
That gene of God that's placed within 
But at the time appointed, we were anointed
To believe this present Word
The only evidence that His Life is within
Justified we are free from sin

Chorus
For we were born to rise and shine
For the Lord is come
We'll rise and shine
We're made to overcome
We'll rise and shine
Like the stars above.

We'll suffer affliction by this confession
The Scripture has foretold
But we'll consider our trials more precious than Gold
Leaving worldly pleasures far behind
Far greater riches we must now claim
Never mind the reproaches you bear for His Name
God's Children won't be ashamed.

By holding the vision before every decision
That's how we overcome
The Lord is having then the pre-eminence
We'll trust Him ever and doubt Him never
For the promises He has made
Realising there's no need to be afraid
For His Word can never fail

Amidst this world's frustration we have restoration
The earnest of the Promised Land
Only be thou courageous and strong
We have the hidden manna, six barley measure
We are waiting for that final one
Our Lord won't rest till His work is done
We'll have the fullness of the Son

We're made superhuman over every condition
By the Power of God's Word
Holding our confession unto the end
And by His election we'll change dimension
To a world that's so sublime
No more to be mortal creatures of time
There forever we will shine."
1378;The Angel With The Swept Back Wings;;"The light has come, 
 to show where we are going
In bridal step along the way

The revealed Word 
 has shown us our placing
A Super-race we are,
 in the perfect rest of God

Chorus
Oh that Angel with Swept back wings
He's the One that means the most
He took us in the Inner Veil
To reveal Himself more privately
Here we are in perfect step
In the promises of God
Oh that Angel with swept back wings
He's the One that means the most.

All honour and glory, 
and praise to His Name
For He was found worthy to take the Book 
And show us our names.
Flesh of His flesh and bones of His bones
In harmony we stand
In God's provided place,
In the Seventh Seal of God.

The Seven Spirits in Revelation
Is that notable Angel
Who brought back the keys
To open the third-pull 
Came back shouting Grace, 
 Grace, Grace, Grace
For I Jesus is the Word of God
That's in the midst right now."
1379;The Bridal Walk;;"As we walk together, 
Side by side we stand
Holding hands together, 
To one Promised Land
Let us not be selfish, 
We can not go alone
They must all be with us
To sit with Him on His Throne

Chorus
Oh how we love our Jesus
And how He loves us so
We will never cease to praise Him
We'll shout it while eternity roll

Let us keep on walking,
Straight to Gethsmane
Let us keep rejoicing, 
Seeing the Victory
There may be a tugging
Friends may not want to go
But that's just the testing
Let Brotherly Kindness flow.

Now we walk to Jordan, 
Keep on holding hands.
Don't be afraid of demons
They can never stop God's plan
Looking back at Calvary, 
Watching the finished plan.
Jesus come and take us
In Your Word we stand.

Wash away all sorrow
Dry up all those tears
There is no time for weeping
Saints we are almost there
Have you smelled the Fragrance
Coming with the breeze
Sound that ram-horn Joshua
It's real, It's real, It's real."
1380;She Steps A Lady;;"She steps a lady all clothed in white
Surrounded by Rainbow coloured lights
The sweetest smile she wears across her face
As she beholds the One in whom she has found grace

Chorus
And what joy now fills her Love's heart
As He beholds his lovely Bride at last
And with joy will the angels sing
What adoration from the seraphim

Objections considered - all hollering will cease
All other women will have to hold their peace
He whispered to us in a language unknown
And now the beauty of His Bride will be shown

Oh the mystery that the Two is now become One
And the victory of all ages is finally won
Flesh of His Flesh, Bone of His Bone, we are the same
United we stand under that special Name

The Lamb takes His Wife by the hand
And leads her unto that Promised Land
Humble woman He has chosen for His Own
Will sit with Him as Queen upon His Throne"
1381;It's A Song Angels Cannot Sing;;"Angels never knew the joy that is mine
For the Blood has never washed away their sin
So they say in Heaven there will come a time,
When solemnly they will listen,
Till we sing Amazing Grace.

Chorus
And it's a song all the angels cannot sing,
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
It's a song all the angels can not sing,
I once was lost , but now I'm found.

Holy is the Lord, the angels sing,
Before the Throne of God continually,
For me to join this song would be a natural thing,
But they just won't know the words,
That Love lifted me."
1382;God's Elective Love;;"Deep calleth unto deep
In the night time I scarcely sleep
Why art thou disquietened
 within me oh my soul
I've found Hope in the Lord of Glory
He has revealed my life's mystery
Shown me that I was in His thought
Since the times of old.

Chorus
It's the rising of the Son
When the children of God 
 on the earth are born
It's evening Light from above
It's nothing less than 
 God's Elective Love.

I see Mary she's walking slowly,
Along the narrow road that's dusty
When the Child is born
  your sorrow will be gone
Ester, Ester, touch that Scepter
With the King you have found favour,
Anything you do, do it in that Name.

Samson locks are now longer
Faith muscles are becoming stronger
Between the pillars the Lord
  will strike His Masterpiece
Now the Headstone is drawing nearer
Dynamics are worked in greater measure
Pulsations of faith will soon
 create ""let there be"".

Seven Thunders activating the countdown
North Star leads the battle stars to the showdown
Two hundred million devils will be on the run
Joel's mighty army comes on display
The elements will tremble before them on that day
For strong is the Lord that executeth His Word

Our hearts are burning with expectation
For the promise eternal vacation
Reservations have already been made
Next attraction coming soon
Bridegroom and Bride leaves for honeymoon
On the wings of Love she'll take her flight
Through the skies."
1383;My Sins Were Higher;;"My sins were higher

 when the fire came down.
Singing Glory Hallelujah 
when the fire came down
When My Lord sanctified me.

My sins were flowing like a river
When the Lord sanctified me,
My sins were flowing like a river
When the Lord sanctified me.

My sins were deeper 
 than the ocean
When the Lord sanctified me,
My sins were deeper
 than the ocean
When the Lord sanctified me."

To Oneness with our God
With Seven Seals opening up

Rapturing Faith for 
 Rapturing Grace now revealing.

Chorus
The Adoption - full Redemption
All authority and Power
Is restored unto the Bride
In this great hour

I was troubled and confused
 in Laodecia
No satisfaction for 
 this deep and inner hunger
Clouds of darkness hovered
 o'er me, trying to blind me
The Light broke through, the shadows flew
And now I can see

We are quickened 
 by this blessed revelation
Changing from Glory 
 unto Glory for Redemption
Perfect Love uniting 
 hearts for translation
Perfect Faith conquering 
 death for Resurrection"
1385;How Deep The Father's Love;;"How deep the Father's Love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His Only Son
To make a wretch His treasure
How great the pain of seeing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to Glory

Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon His Shoulders
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
Call out amoung the scoffers
It was my sins that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me Life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom.
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection
Why should I gain from His reward
I can not give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom"
1386;All The Way I'm Going;;"All the way I'm going all the way (x2)

I'm going all the way (x2)
I'm going all the way with the Lord"
1387;Kick Him Down;;"Kick him down, kick him down
Have the devil on the run
A son of God must not be trodden down
So kick that mamba down

Arise and shine, 
King Theophany has come
Let's hold to His unchanging hand.
Praise the Lord, Praise His Name
And be garrisoned by prayer
Don't let the devil shake your confidence
Or in your heart put fear
Don't you hate your brother
That's root of bitterness

Cover your face, cover your feet
With reverence and humility
Let's go into action with God's given ability
Stand flatfooted in your trails
Though they may be sometimes mean
Always remember to call Jesus on the scene
Remember everyday to have that Token on display
It's an act of Love to follow that Dove
That Snow-White Dove, That Snow White Dove

Unconquered by tradition in this day we stand
Like Joshua and Caleb we're going to take that land
But brother it won't be easy, 
It's not a flowery bed of ease
Remember that old devil will bring a squeeze
Don't let him have you blue 
Wondering what you are gonna do
For we are on that seventh peak 
So we'll just speak, we'll just speak"

You have given Life to me

You have given Life to me."

1395;What God Has Done;;"Men will always preach the promises of yesterday,
Of a baby to be born in Bethlehem, 
They tell of the ark of Noah
They marvel at the Faith of Abraham

Chorus
But what has God done in your day,
Are you looking to the Word for yesterday,
There's a promise that saved them, 
But do you know the promise for your day as well

We all know of the story of Jonah,
And of Daniel and the lions we often tell,
We know of the promise that saved them,
But do you know the promise for your day as well

Do you know theirs is a promise for our time,
Have you heard of Malachi 4
For behold I will send you Elijah
Before the great and dreadful day of the Lord"
1396;I'm Going That Way;;"I've heard of a land of joy and peace
 and wonderful Light

 forever shall stay,
And having been saved by Grace Divine,
 I'm going that way.

Chorus
I'm going that way,
 I'm going that way
And Jesus the Saviour I adore
 is with me each day.
I'm clinging to Him, and never to stray.
Just singing His praises all day long
I'm going that way.

The glorious news I will tell and sing
 as I onward go
For those who are still astray in sin,
 My Saviour may know
I want them to sing His praises
 some beautiful day
O glory to Him who died for me,
 I'm going that way.

I know I shall meet Him at the Gate
 when trials are past.
I know I shall meet Him face to face
 in glory at last.
And now I believe when we meet,
 well done He'll say,
For trusting His soul's redeeming Blood,
 I'm going that way."
1397;The Perfect Age;;"In the beginning 
 God made this beautiful land,
Made a man in His Image,

No sin did defile Him, 
 God's perfection was clean,
But the woman did fall,

And she brought forth Cain

Chorus
But we're going back to that perfect age
There'll be no more death,
Sickness or sorrow this earth to decay,
God sent One among us to restore all things,
And the sixth day is passing the seventh is nigh
The beginning again

What an awful condition 
 this world is in today,
The Only One Who could help them
  has been turned away,
But the Bride is waiting on Him
 for the Bridegroom to say,
Behold all things are new to His chosen few, 
In that Perfect Day."
1398;I Sent Forth A Man;;"There'll be many that day, come to Jesus and say
Haven't I preached the gospel and prayed in your Name
But Jesus will say, I never even knew you,
You turned down the Truth that I sent your way.

Chorus
I sent forth a man with the spirit of Elijah,
He had, ""Thus Saith the Lord"",
He cried against sin
He cried, come out don't partake of their evil
And He said, follow me as I follow Christ.

There was a sign for the gentiles like Paul had in his day
It was the Pillar of Fire that met him in the way
Now if you don't believe what His servant had to say,
You'll be judged by the Word as Jesus did say."
1399;God's Word Is True;;"Listen my friend 
To these words of mine,
There is an answer,

To all that believe.

Chorus
God's Word is true, 
He will never fail you
If you'll walk in the light, 
He'll see you through
Like all of God's prophets, 
That before us have been
This prophet fulfilled the words, 
That were written of him

There is a Promise.
To us this day

Is to come our way
And we find this Promise
In Malachi 4
And we must believe it,
So that God can restore."

And this is what I see
The people of the Lord are perfect as can be.

Chorus
Oh, praise the Lord, It's Jesus that I see
The Bright and Morning Star
Revealed in you and me
And I thank God I'm part of that family
Where the people are perect as can be.

Don't speak evil about your brother
Lest you speak against the law
And you know the law is perfect
Without a single flaw
For as long as he's repenting 
From the sin that he can see  
Our brother brother is as perfect,
Just as perfect as can be.

Let's go on unto perfection
Though we are potentially
Till Christ be formed within us
And all promises believe
And this body is translated right into the heavenlies
Where the people of the Lord are perfect as can be."
1403;More Of Thee;;"More of Thee, more of Thee

If you will only follow me
There's none but Christ can satisfy
There's no other name for me"

He gives to me."
1407;If That Isn't Love;;"He left His splendor of heaven
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely Hill of Golgotha
There to lay down His life for me
 
CHORUS
If that isn't Love, the ocean is dry,
There's no stars in the sky,
And the sparrow can't fly,
If that isn't Love,
 the Heaven is a myth
There's no feeling like this,
If that isn't Love.

Even in death He remembered
The thief hanging by His side
Then He spoke with Love  
 and compassion.
Then He took him to Paradise."
1408;Ten Thousand Years;;"Ten thousand years
We'll just be started

Taking thy whole bright armour
Going to meet the foe
I shall be strong within Thee

After the day is o'er
Safe are Thine arms of refuge
Peaceful, the Homeland shore"

And He lives for ever,
With His Saints to reign
He arose, He arose,
Hallelujah! Christ arose!

Vainly they watch His bed,
Jesus, my Saviour

Jesus, my Saviour,
He tore the bars away,
Jesus, my Lord!"

Hiding in Thee
Thou blest ""Rock of Ages"",

In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation casts o'er me its power,
In the tempests of life on its wide, heaving sea,
Thou blest ""Rock of Ages"", I'm hiding in Thee!

How often, when trials like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul!"

I walk with the King, praise His Name!
No longer I roam, my soul faces home,
I walk and I talk with the King.

For years in the fetters of sin I was bound,
The world could not help me no comfort I found,
But now like the birds and the sunbeams of spring,
I'm free and rejoicing I walk with the King.

Look up and let Jesus come into your life;
The joy of salvation to you He would bring
Come into the sunlight and walk with the King."

When your cup runneth over with joy,
You find it easy to pray and to sing all day,

To burden your heart and mind
Love abundant will cover
And give you grace to bear
The things which are most unkind.

Nor ever the Christ betray
Of your Heavenly Lover
Your life will testify
Confirming the things you say."

Trust in Jesus and He will keep you,
In the shelter of His arms."

Let the blessed sunshine in!
Clear the darkened windows, 
Open wide the door,
Let a little sunshine in!

  in the cause you love?
Are your prayers unanswered 
 by your God above?
Clear the darkened windows, 
Open wide the door,
Let a little sunshine in!

Would you go rejoicing
 in the upward way?
Knowing naught of darkness,
 dwelling in the day.
Clear the darkened windows,

1423;A Friend I Have Called Jesus;;"A Friend I have called Jesus
Whose love is strong and true,
And never fails howe'er He's tried,
No matter what, I do,
I've sinned against this Love of His,
But when I knelt to pray
Confessing all my guilt to Him,
The sin clouds rolled away.

Chorus
It's just like Jesus to roll the clouds away,
It's just like Jesus to keep me day by day,
It's just like Jesus all along the way,
It's just like His great Love.

Sometimes the clouds of trouble
Bedim the sky above.
I cannot see my Saviour's face,
I doubt His wondrous Love.
But He from heaven's mercy seat
Beholding my despair,
In pity bursts the clouds between,
And shows me He is there.

When sorrow's clouds o'ertake me,
And break upon my head,
When life seems worse than useless,
And earthly hopes are dead,
I take my grief to Jesus then,
Nor do I go in vain,
For heavenly hope He gives that cheers,
Like sunshine after rain.

Oh, I could sing forever
Of Jesus' Love Devine
Of all His care and tenderness
For this poor life of mine,
His Love is in, and overall,
And wind and waves obey,
When Jesus whispers ""Peace be still"".
And rolls the clouds away."
1424;I Am A Stranger Here;;"I am a stranger here,
 within a foreign land,
My home is far away,
 upon a golden strand,
Ambassador to be  
 of realms beyond the sea.
I'm here on business of my King.

Chorus
This is the message that I bring,
A message angels fain would sing,
""Oh, be ye reconciled!""
Thus saith the Lord and King
""Oh, be ye reconciled to God!""

I come to tell of One
Who gave His precious Life,
That He may offer peace,
And end the sinful strife,
This message I repeat,
'Tis God who doth entreat,
And that's my business for my King

This is the King's command,
That all man everywhere
Repent and turn away
From sin's seductive snare,
That all who will obey
With Him shall reign for ever
And that's my business for my King.

You would not turn away,
And spurn His proffered Grace,
If you could only see
The Love upon His face,
Your heart He fain would reach,
Through me He doth beseech
And that's my business for my King."
1425;Soldier Of Christ;;"Soldier of Christ be steadfast!
This is the ""evil day"",

This is the charge He gives you,
Having done all, to stand.

Chorus
Stand, therefore stand,
Stand, therefore stand,
Trusting in Jesus our Saviour
Having done all, to stand.

Patient and true and faithful,
Facing the deadly foe,
Stand in the place appointed,
March, when He bids you go.
All through the passing moments,
Onward to Canaan's land.
Banish all fear and doubting
Having done all, to stand.

This is no time to question,
This is no time to yield,
Never a soul should falter
Bearing His sword and shield;
Keep in the ranks of Jesus,
Watching on every hand;
This is the Christian duty,
Having done all, to stand."
1426;Wounded For Me;;"Wounded for me, wounded for me,
There on the cross 
He was  wounded for me.

 and now I am free.
All because Jesus was wounded for me.

Dying for me, dying for me,
There on the cross He was dying for me
Now in His death my redemption I see
All because Jesus was dying for me.

Rise for me, rise for me
Up from the grave He has risen for me;
Now evermore from death's sting I am free,
All because Jesus has risen for me.

Living for me, living for me,
Up in the skies He is living for me;
Daily He's pleading and praying for me
All because Jesus is living for me.

Coming for me, coming for me,
One day to earth, He is coming for me;
Then with what joy His dear face I shall see;
Oh, how I praise Him, He's coming for me!"
1427;Jesus, Lead Me Up;;"Jesus, lead me up the mountain,

Where the Saints can see the Fountain
Where the pure are keeping clean

Chorus
Lead me higher up the mountain,
Give me fellowship with Thee;
In Thy Light I see the Fountain,
And the Blood is cleansing me.

Higher up, where light increases,
Rich above all earthly good,
Where the life of sinning ceases,
Where the Spirit comes in flood. 

Lead me higher, nothing dreading,
Never in the race to stop,
In Thy footsteps keep me treading,
Give me grace to reach the top.

Save me better, make me surer,
Put me where the fire refines,
Where the breath of hope is purer,
Where the brightest Glory shines"
1428;With Christ In The Vessel;;"With Christ in the vessel 
 I can smile at the storm,

Until He takes me Home."
1429;There's Been A Change;;"There's been a change in me,

Oh, glorious day."

A little silver and a little gold
But in that city
Where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one the silver lined

Chorus
I've got a mansion,  just over the hilltop.
In that bright land where
 we'll never grow old.
And some day yonder
 we'll never more wonder
But walk on streets that, are purest gold.

Though often tempted, tormented and tested
And like a prophet, my pillow a stone
And though I find here, no permanent dwelling
I know he will give me
A mansion of my own.

Don't think me poor, deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged, I'm heavenly bound
I'm just a pilgrim, in search of a city
I want a gold one, that's silver lined
Just build my mansion, next door to Jesus
And tell the angels, I'm coming home.

It doesn't matter who lives around me
Just hope my mansion sets near the throne
I have no castle, nor earthly kingdom
I know He'll guide me till I get home
My home up yonder, the streets are golden
And hope my mansion sets near The Throne"
1435;Stop And Let Me Tell You;;"Stop and let me tell you,
What the Lord has done for me.

What the Lord has done for me."
1436;How Big Is God;;"How big is God

Chorus
We're nearing the shore,
We're nearing the shore
Troubles soon will be over, we'll suffer no more,
Trials all past, it's victory at last,
Oh it is wonderful to be nearing the shore.

He will say welcome, children of mine.
Come in and rest, this land possess,
Oh it is wonderful to be nearing the shore."
1441;Did You Think To Pray;;"E're you left your room this morning
Did you think to pray,
In the Name of Christ our Saviour,
Did you ask for loving favour as a shield today?

Chorus
Oh how praying rests the weary,
Prayer will change the night to day,
So when life seems dark and weary,
Don't forget to pray.

When you met with great temptation,
Did you think to pray,
By His dying Love merit
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As your guide and stay.

When your heart was filled with anger,
Did you think to pray,
Did you plead for grace my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who has crossed your way"

But faith sees the Light yes it's definite Light,
Just by the riverside.

Chorus
There's a light at the river, a light at the river,
There's a light at the river I can see,
My Lord will stand and hold in His hand,
A light at the river for me.

To that deep silent river we will one day stand,
And we'll cross over the waters wide,
But He'll carry us away to the realms of day,
To our home on the other side."

If I work till the close of the day,
I shall see the great King in His beauty,
When I've gone the last mile of the way.

Chorus
When I've gone the last mile of the way,
I will rest at the close of the day,
And I know there are joys that await me,
When I've gone the last mile of the way.

here the dearest of ties we must sever,
Tears of sorrow are seen every day,
But no sickness, no sighing forever,
When I have gone the last mile of the way.

And if I have earnestly striven,
And have tried all His will to obey,
'Twill enhance all the Rapture of Heaven,
When I have gone the last mile of the way."
1445;I Was There;;"Before the moon or the sun,
Or that time had begun,
Before that God ever said, 
 ""Let there be light"",
Before there was a grain of sand,
I was in the Master's plan,
I was there, Hallelujah I was there.

Before this earth did appear,
Or there was an atmosphere,
Before there ever was  
   a star to grace the sky,
When the sons of God did sing,
Praise and Glory to the King,
I was there, Hallelujah I was there.

When my Saviour gave His Life
Shed His blood and paid the price,
When the mountains shook and
  the veil was rent in twain,
When the spear did pierce His side,
I was there, Hallelujah I was there.

Till the trump of God should sound,
Calling me to higher realms,
My eyes are fixed on Jesus Christ
My Lord and God,
Soon He'll call His waiting Bride,
To be ever at His side,
Then I'll be there, hallelujah I'll be there."

And thank Jesus that I made things right,
I believe it's end time my friends,
Look at the world, it's as dark as the night.

Chorus
I believe it won't be long when He shall come,
He will come as a thief in the night,
The world will go on as before
But to the gentiles, He'll close heaven's door.

O my friend ask Jesus today,
To wash all your sins away,
He will hear your humble heart's prayer,
Look in God's word and you'll find Him there."

Thank you Lord, that it's not my sin
 but the Blood that you see.

Chorus
O Gracious Jesus, make me so small,
In worldly matters, make me not at all,
But in Thy Spirit, make me all so tall,
O Gracious Jesus, Lord of all.

Oft in my loneliness,
When I cried out to Thee.
You stood in the midst of my heart,
 and you warned me so tenderly,
Now I know you once again,
 now I long for that day,
When I shall hear the call of your Voice
 and you'll take me away."

Then last of all the head came down
Perfection was complete
For He alone was the one
Who could build a masterpiece.

And when He looked upon Him
He was so inspired
He smote Him to make Him speak

Its an urgent cry,
Apply the Token or die.

Ecological crisis is filling
man's hearts with fear.
With the ozone layer being destroyed,
Divers earthquakes are everywhere;
But it's written in the scripture
The Heaven shall depart like a scroll
Thus saith the Lord,
It's exactly what the prophets foretold;
But stand like Micaiah,
Stay with the Seventh Seal Vision.
You just say what Elijah already did say.

Now demons in the atmosphere
Are pressing their way into the hearts of men,
Who are marked by God for their iniquity
In rejecting the prophet whom God has sent,
The slaughtering angels are ready
To slay the young and the old,
So watch the cares of this life,
Remember Lot's wife who for vanity lost her soul
Stand like Rahab with your token on display,
For the destroying angels are already on their way."
1466;Let The Dove Lead;;"Here I stand in need of You
This day and this hour,
How can I, how can I go on Lord,
If you don't go before me?
Here I am in this wilderness on my own
I'm depending on Your Message Lord
Alone to take me home.

Chorus
There's a Message coming forth
Father, I pray, You'll let the Dove lead
As we listen now to the Message 
 of the Lord.
Father, I pray, Your way we follow.

As the prophet stood that day
Being out on his own,
Realising that he could not find his way alone
He had to give up even though he tried
To get out of the wilderness,
He depended on the Guide."
1467;God's Family;;"We're part of the family
That's been born again
Part of the family
Whose Love knows no end
For Jesus has saved us
And made us His own
Now we're part of a family
That's on its way Home

Chorus
Sometimes we laugh together
Sometimes we cry
Sometimes we share together
Heartaches and sighs
Sometimes we dream together
Of how it will be
When we all get to heaven
God's family.

When a brother meets sorrow
We all feel his grief
When he's passed through the valley
We all feel relieved
Together in sunshine, together in rain
Together in victory
Through His precious Name.

And though some go Home before us
We'll all meet again
Just inside that city, as we enter in.
There'll be no more parting
With Jesus we'll be 
Together forever, God's family."
1468;I Will Extol Thee;F;"I will extol Thee, oh Lord
For Thou hast lifted me up
And hast not made my foes
To rejoice over me
Oh Lord my God, I cried unto Thee
And Thou hast healed me
So in my prosperity I said
I shall never be moved.

Chorus
For oh Lord, Thou hast brought up
 my soul from the grave.
Though hast kept me alive and from sin
That I shall not go down to the pit
Sing unto the Lord,
All ye precious saints of His
And give thanks at the remembrance
Of His Holiness.

Hear oh Lord and have mercy upon me
Lord be my Helper
Thou hast turned for me
 my mourning into dancing,
Thou hast put off my sack clothing
And girded me with gladness.
To the end my glory
May sing praises to Thee.

What profit is there in my blood
If I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust praise Thee?
Shall it declare Thy truth?
For your anger endureth but a moment
In your favour there is life
Weeping may endure for a night
But joy cometh in the morning"
1469;Lighthouse;;"There's a Lighthouse on the hillside
That overlooks life's sea
When I'm tossed it sends a light
That I might see
For that light that shines in darkness
Will safely lead me through
If it wasn't for that Lighthouse
My ship would sail no more.

Chorus
And I thank God for the Lighthouse
I owe my life to Him
Jesus is the Lighthouse
And from the rocks of sin
He has shown the Light around me
That I could clearly see
If it wasn't for the Lighthouse
Where would this ship be

Everybody that lives around us
Said tear that Lighthouse down
And all the bid ship, they don't seem
To sail this way anymore.
There's no use of that Lighthouse standing around
But then my mind goes back to that stormy night.
When just in time I saw that light.
For the light that's on the hill
That over looks life's sea."
1470;Have I Done My Best;F;"I wonder, have I done my best to Jesus
Who died upon the cruel tree?
To think of His great sacrifice at Calvary
I know my Lord expects the best from me.

How many are the lost that I have lifted?
How many are the chained I've helped to free.
I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus
When He has done so much for me.

The hours that I have wasted are so many
The hours I have spent for Christ so few
Because of my lack of love for Jesus
I wonder if His heart is breaking too?

I wonder have I cared enough for other
Or have I let them die alone?
I might have helped a wonderer to the Saviour
The seed of precious life I might have sown
No longer will I stay within the valley
I'll climb to mountain heights above
The world is dying now for want of someone
To tell them of the Saviour's matchless love"
1471;Fill Me;;"Dear Lord, I know You called me
And I'm baptised in Your Name
Yet there is the promise
You have made
So Lord here I'm asking you
To fulfil Your Word
That You would fill me
With the Holy Ghost.

Chorus
I'm asking you to fill me
With the Holy Spirit
Fill me, fill me with Your Love
So Lord, it could not just be a part
But a circumcision of the whole heart
There'll be no difference in my standing
 and my state,
I'm asking you to fill me.

For me to live this Christian Life
This old man must die
For Your Spirit to abide
Lord, I don't want reformation
But a Holy Ghost transfusion
For you have said that 
I must be born again.

Lord I see the challenge is rising,
And so many amoungst us are falling,
Shows me Lord, I need another touch
If You should come and live in me
I'll be having constant victory
By the Faith that overcomes the world."
1472;Let Us Draw Near;G;"Are we weak and troubled
 or in deep despair?
Is the avenger of the soul on our trail?
Well the Name of Our Lord
 is a Mighty Tower
That the righteous can run into and be safe.

Chorus
Let us draw near with a true heart
In full assurance of faith
That we might find grace
And strength to help 
In time of need

It took a perfect sacrifice 
Before we could ever attain to Perfect Faith,
That's why Christ the Perfect Lamb
The atonement came, the Holiest of Holies
He cleared the way.

So let us draw near, having our hearts
Sprinkled by His Blood
For now we have free access
To the Throne of God.

We were not made angels
We are of mortal kind
And we daily make mistakes
For we are weak but we have not
A High Priest who cannot be touched
With feelings of our infirmities"
1473;The God Of This Evil Age;;"The God of this evil age
Has blinded their eyes today
A people who walk their own way
Not according to God's Word
They're denying the things He's done
Rejecting His only Son
And accepting the creeds of man
Oh, this is the evening time.

Chorus
This is the evening time
It's later than you think
The Bride is preparing now
For her Lord to meet
All things are ready now
The combine is here
He that hath an ear to hear
The evening time is here.

Gross darkness throughout the land
And people can't understand
God's prophet has warned the land
Proclaiming the Word to man
So if you'll be saved today
Just follow that way He gave
That's accepting the Word of God
Oh, this is the evening time
Seven Thunders they don't believe
How else could the Seals be revealed
To give the Bride rapturing faith.

Sleeping saints and our Lord to meet
If you want to be raptured today
Follow Ephesians 4:11's way
It's the anointed Word today
Oh, this is the evening time
We are conquering the mountains
Taking back the land
Marching our vessels into war
We are binding up the wounded
They will live to fight again
Advancing from the ocean
Back to the shore.

We must carefully plan our strategy
Confusing the enemy
We're doing it all through
Unity, unity, unity"
1474;Jesus Never Fails;F;"So many have tested Him
Throughout the course of time
So many still reach out to Him
With broken hearts and minds
And every one of them will say
Without exception that they find 
Jesus never fails

Chorus
Jesus never fails
Jesus never fails
You might as well 
 get thee behind me Satan
You can not prevail
Because Jesus never fails

Even in the days of old
He brought His people through
Then He came and showed His Love
And died for me and you
But he rose again to prove
That the story had been true
That Jesus never fails.

Sometimes in my life comes trouble
At times so hard to bear
I know I could not make it
Without my Saviour being there
It's so encouraging just to know
However deep we are in despair
That Jesus never fails"
1476;I Was Born To Serve;;"From the dust of the earth,
My God formed this body,
His breath made me a living soul
And then the Light of His Word,
Struck the germ deep inside me,
That is why, that is why
I love Him so

Chorus
For I was made in His likeness
Created in His image,
For I was born to serve the Lord
And I can't deny Him,
I will always walk beside Him.

For I was born to serve the Lord
My hands they were made
  to serve His people,
My eyes they were made
 to read God's Word
My feet they were made
 to walk in His pathway
And my body is the temple of the Lord.

Whom He fore-knew,
He did predestinate,
To be conformed into His image
Whom He fore-knew, 
Its them He also called,
Whom He called, He did justify
Whom He justified, He has glorified
And I'm waiting for the translation"
1477;My Tribute - To God Be The Glory;G;"How can I say thanks
For the things You have done for me
Things so undeserved
Yet You gave
To prove Your Love to me.

The voices of a million angels
Could not express my gratitude
All that I am and ever hope to be
I owe it all to Thee.

Chorus
To God be the glory
To God be the glory
To God be the glory
For the things He has done
With His blood He has saved me
With His power He has raised me
To God be the glory
For the things He has done

Just let me live my life,
Let it be pleasing Lord unto Thee
And should I gain any praise
Let it go to Calvary"
1478;Take Me Separate Me;;"Lord How I long to be lost
In your precious arms
And feel contentment
Sweep over my soul
To hear you speak peace 
To the waters of my troubled mind
I would rest in the strength there I find

Take me, separate me
From the things of this life
Where I only see heartache and strife
Hide me, uphold me on eagle's wings
I know You'll never ever let me go
Down deep in my soul

There's a calling, a longing for home
Cause I'm so tired of this world below
I know that somewhere,
 beyond the curtain of time
Lies a body, a new body that's mine"
1479;Restore Your Church;;"We need wisdom, we need power
And true Love for each other
We have had so many big 
 but empty words,
So we come before Your face
Asking for Your grace
Bring Your people to a state of fruitful life
Restore Your Church Again

Chorus
Touch Your people once again
With Your precious Holy hand, we pray,
Let your Kingdom shine upon this earth
Through a living glorious Church
Not for temporary needs,
But to restore authority and power,
Let your mighty rushing wind blow in,
Touch your people once again

Lord You see Your tired servants
And Your broken wounded soldiers
Oh, how much we need your precious
 healing hands,
We need the power of the cross
It's the only source for us
When we stand up facing final battle cry
Restore Your Church again"
1480;We'll Have Joy;;"There's a longing here below
Only God's people can know
To be changed in a moment
In the rapture caught away
We are longing for that city
As Abraham did in his day
I am longing for the bright 
 and cloudless day.

Chorus
We'll have joy over there
In that city bright and fair
When we gather around 
To sing ""Amazing Grace""
We will shout and dance around
And we'll sing of His Great Love
Yes we'll sing of His Great Love
 over there.

He will call my name up there
Before I climb those golden stairs
We have loved ones there awaiting
We'll meet at the Eastern Gate
Oh my brother let's press on
Till the battle has been won
I can hardly wait to see my
Saviour's face."
1481;Draw Me Deeper;D;"Draw me from fear 
 into faithfulness
Lead me along Your way,
Draw me from sin
 into Your holiness.
That I might be a living praise.

Draw me deeper, deeper
Into your Word of truth
Deeper and deeper
To prove my love for You
Deeper, deeper to the
 place where You are
Draw me deeper and deeper
That I may know Your heart

Draw me from hate into  Charity
From restlessness into Your Peace
Draw me from anger into gentleness
Till every storm in my life shall cease"
1482;Blessings In The City;;"And it shall be if you listen
To the Voice of the Lord
Faithful to obey all His commandments
That He will set you high
 above all other nations.
And all of his blessings shall overtake you.

Chorus
There will  be blessings in the city
Blessings in the country
Plenty of children
and plenty to feed them.

There will be plenty sheep and cattle
Plenty food and bread
Blessings when you are coming in
Blessings when you are going out

Bring all your tithes into the storehouse
Store up food, food in the temple
Put me to the test, saith the Lord
And I will open all the windows
The windows of Heaven,
And pour out my blessings to overflowing."
1483;Is Your Life Worthy?;;"I heard about a Christian man
Who beats his wife and child
Sweet at church but privately was wild
And someone spoke out bitter words against
 a man of God - split the church and 
 everyone chose sides.
There's a world that's watching you
And a God who's watching too
Stop and hear this question, think it through.

Chorus
Is your life worthy of the gospel?
Jesus wife who you claim to be
If you choose to bear His Name
Then I pray don't bring it shame
Please look and see, Is your life worthy?

A woman claims to speak in tongues
While dressing to appeal - Failed to see
and speak for something real
Sometimes it's hard to see in folks
If He's really there
Sayings things that angels never dare
It is best you never heard
Than to break My Saviour's Word
Hopefully by something you'll be stirred"
1484;His Covenant He'll Keep;;"Why have we been distressed?
Oh, we've been troubled sore
What is it that we've done?
Have we transgressed His law?
See where we have wronged,
Let's forsake our own ways
And He will make us strong.

Chorus
For He hath cast us down
But He will lift up
Though He hath broken
Yet He will bind,
He hath wounded,
But He will heal
And with His people
His covenant He'll keep.

Let us search and test our ways
And see where we have wronged,
Let us lift our hearts in praise
And worship Him who's our God."
1485;Hold On A Little Longer;;"Oh Christian, we are living in
The last and evil days 
And I know our way
And he held my God's people 
Is gonna sem hard -Oh yes
But remember, if God is with us
He's more, than the whole world 
Against us {So we've to hold on}

Hold ,on a little longer
Hold ,on a little longer
(One of these days)
Everything is going to be alright

There was a place called Egypt's land
It was under Pharaoh's comand 
And he held my God's People 
In bondage there
(Oh yes he did church)
When they were praying 
They had to steal away
These are words that 
God's people would say

It was in my GOD's plan
To sent Moses down in Egypt's land
He said,'Moses, go tell old pharaoh
You better let my people go
And when Moses was drawig nigh I know
He had sisters and brothers cry,
But he told them to hold on

Moses lead he children out of bondage
Down to the banks of the Red sea
Some of them was troubled in mind 
Cause pharaoh's army was close behind 
But Moses said Dont be afraid 
God is on our side
And he will do what he said,
All you can do is hold on

There was a rod in Moses 's hand
He stsretched it out 
And they walked across on the land
And when they reached the other side,
And Moeses had saw Everybody 
Was alright 









And he held my God's people"
1486;Tired Underprivillege;;"When I think about what God has done
Back there on calvary
Even seven angels  coming in  a cloud 
Bringing in redemption or me 
Opening up the lamp's book of life
And all the hidden mystries
And I know that we have eaten the book
What a poeple we should be,
And when I see another corn of wheat
Coming to a mature stage 
An this is a day of redemption 
And the pri e has been paid
Yet Isee the thigs You've Promised
Missing in my life
Oh How I want to lose my life
So your lif could be 
wrapped up in mine


For I'm tired living underprivileged
When I see what God has done
I'm tired living as a servant
When its time for manifested sons
Lord you gave revival 
And you promised the third pull too
For the great works we have to do

There  are souls under the alter
They are crying out how long?
The sleeping saints, they are anxiously
Awaiting on the resurrection 
In my heat there's a cry 
To go back to that place 
No more dark in a mirror
But seeing face to face
The whole creation is groaning
Waiting on that great release
The lion wants to lay down
With the lamp
For a thousand years of peace
And I want see the one
Who has been with us all the time
But still I want to loose my life 
So his life Could be 
Wrapped up in mine

A new day has dawned
And I just can't go on this way
Just saying that I'm a  christian
Walking with my bible everyday
The prophet said he true church 
Would write another book of Acts 
And If don't come back to that place
Then I have missed the mark
But between revival
The locks have grown, there's a possibility 
The meal has been placed 
Upon the sticks
To be backed into reality
The fith to use the power
Is growing greater al the time
So like Samson:
Just once more lord
Like Ester : If I perish Lord
Like Jonah: To do your bidding Lord
Like Joseph: To be a prisoner
For the greater works we have to do"
1487;One Love;;"There was a time in a history of  man
When he commanded the creation.
And he and his maker had one Love
And man lost the power of the name
For he had broken the bond of one love
It then took the blood of a spotless Lamb
To be an atonement for fallen man
It was God's substitute for his sin and shame 
It was a part of God's great mystery, 
To redeem you and me again
Back to one love

Then one day the Real Lamb came
He came in father's Name
To be a ransom for One Love
When on the cross my Saviour died 
The power of death He had defied
To give us the token for One Love
He then changed our destiny
He could now come and live in you and me
Making us creatures now bound for eternity.

Brothers and sisters can't you see
He died to set you and I free again again!
Back to one love
The Holy Ghost the Lord did send
He fell upon some redeemed man
They had the token and One Love

They baptise in Jesus Name and of his doctrine
They were'nt ashamed 
For they were believers In One Love,
But then as the ages rolled away 
From this doctrine evil men did stray
And the serpent began to ride this trail again 
Beware of the creeds of wicked men 
Designed to bring us back to bondage again
But we want one love

In the end time the son of man came
He came in His Father's Name
To give us the token of one love
Seven Thunders sounded in our souls
Our lord had gathered us from this wicked world 
To united in One Love

Then we will speak and command creation again
Sons and daughters In the Father's Name
Having power and wrapped up in His Love
The trumpet shall sound 
And we will take our flight to the skies 
To be in glory where we'll be with our Father again 
Back to one love"
1488;Be Identified;D / G;"What does it profit a man to follow?
The vain tradition of misguided men 
Who try to establish a righteousness?
of their own A profitation of their sins?


O tell me what do you think
Of the blood of Jesus that was shed for you
Is it sufficient to pardon from sin
(Is it sufficient to purge your conscience from sin
(Is it sufficient to give you dominion over sin)Set you free,
Putting peace within?

To be identified with your sacrifice
To be really justified, look to he place where 
Jesus died, Be identified really justified
look to the place where Jesus died

What can a man do to be justified?
What does it take for an angry God to be 
Pacified? If you trust in your power,
Or struggle with all your might.
Yet your righteousness is like filth rags 
In God's sight

What a work of grace that a man could clearly 
See-The lamp with seven horns and seven eyes
When darkness covers he earth and death begins 
to strike in the place where the blood has not been 
Applied What do you think of the opening of those Seals
God provided way for you? Is it sufficient? Then, don't add or take away
It's God's provided way To save you in this day
What a work of power the blood has done for you and me 
Lifting us from the life of sin,
Turning our bodies heavenly and when Satan ries to convict 
You in the courts of memory 
Hear th lamp return the verdict 'Not guilty,not guilty
(not guilty,you are free'"

Of man and of angels
And though I prophesy
And understand all
Although I have the faith
So mountains may be removed
And though I feed the poor
And give up my life

Chorus
If I have no Charity
If Love does not flow through me
I am nothing
Jesus reduced me to Love

Love is patient and kind
Love is not envious
Not harsh but gentle and meek
Seeks not its own way
Love sings when Jesus prevails
Believes and endures all things
Love hopes and bears every wrong
And Love never fails

One season I was a child
I spoke and thought as a child
But when I turned to a man
Such ways put aside
Though now we see Him
Through a glass
Yet then we shall see Him face to face
Although abide faith and hope
The greatest is Love"

Your loving touch
Drives all my fear away 
Close by your side I want to stay


Lord you know I need 
A brand new touch
 My strength from yesterday is gone
And if you give me Lord 
Another touch 
I'll have the strength to carry on


Lord you know how weak I really am
Even better than my self
But with your help I know realy can 
Make it through the darkest night 
Everything's gonna all right

I thought the son had come to stay 
But all too soon it ran away
And in its place the storm clouds came
And with the clouds there came the rain
It rained so hard and oh so long
But midst the storm I felt a calm
It was your touch 
That brought me through it all
Without your help I'd surely fall"

Do they really want to live

Chorus
The Spoken Word for our day
Is an anchor that is true
It holds when all sinks in life's sea
It guides me

When hope is failing swiftly,
And life seems its worst
I know something that's steadfast
A Message that's gone
It's Christ the Living Truth
I know throughout it all
He is my Absolute"
1494;I Will Praise You;;"You are worthy, to receive glory,
I'll magnify your Name,
Your precious Name.
You are Holy, Lord God Almighty
I will bless your Name till my change

Chorus
And I will praise you
Glory I'm yours Oh! Lord
And I will praise You
The One I adore
Oh I will praise You
For all your goodness to me
And I will praise You
For you are so worthy.

You are wonderful
God so plentiful
Never failed to supply
You're all I need"
1495;Fill Me Holy Spirit;;"I want to live each day
As if it is the last one
I want the truest values in my life
For one day it will truly be my last one
And I will have to leave
 this world behind.

Chorus
Fill me with the Holy Spirit
Fill me with Eternal Life
To live each day
 as if it'll be my last one,
Far above this world
With all its carnal strife.

I want to make the most
 of every moment,
Redeeming to the full 
 each passing time
By putting on His Love
 and bowls of mercy,
And by Grace put on 
His humbleness on mine.

The days I've wasted 
 are not few but many,
I'm praying for a difference
 in my life
Till all my friends and loved ones
 see me changing
Till they see no longer me
But only Christ"
1496;Until I Met Jesus;;"So many times, I dreamt about,
Falling in Love
Visions of rainbows
And sunshine above
But when the rainbows had faded
And the sunshine was gone
I was still searching for,
A love of my own.

Chorus
And since I met Jesus
I know what life really is,
Until I met Jesus
There was no feeling like this
On my face is His sunshine
On my heart His song
And now I can say
""I've a Love of my own"" 

But then one day a stranger came
And He called out my name
And ever since His gentle touch
I have not been the same
He replaced all my dreams
And chasing rainbows
With His joy in my heart
As a love of my own.

Just like castles in the sand
Your Word falls apart
You watch the tides of time erase
The dreams from your heart
But you turn around
To find Him there
He beckons you to come
Waiting to give you
A Love of your own.

And when you meet Jesus
You'll know what Life really is,
Until you meet Jesus
There'll be no feeling like this
On your face will be His sunshine
On your heart His song
And then you ca say
""I've a Love of my own""."
1497;Don't Let Me Remember;;"When a potter gathers up,
The broken pieces
Of a vessel he wishes to make
He doesn't put it back, back together
Like a puzzle
But on the wheel He moulds it again.

Chorus
Lord don't let me see
The way I used to be
Remove the scars
That followed all the pain
And wounds of my shame
Bind up in Your Name
Cast them all into
Your forgetting sea.

Take away all the stripes
That followed a life
That tried to  build upon the dust
Of a shattered dream
Just an empty space of time.
Somewhere in the corner of my mind
And if all the world should recall
Lord don't let me see.

If I should sit among the ashes
Of all the riches
That I have burnt on my way back home
Don't let me find a single thing
 among their ruins.
That could bring to my mind one memory.

Lord don't let me see.
The way I used to be
Remove the scars
That follow all the pain
And the wounds of my shame
Bind up in Your Name
Cast them all into
Your forgetting sea.

Take away all the stripes
That followed a life
That tried to build upon the dust
Of a foolish dream
And down the corridors of time
Don't ever let them come to my mind
And if all the world should recall
Don't let me remember them at all
Oh if all the world should recall
Don't let me see"
1498;Be My Guide;;"No-one ever stood
Where I'm standing today
Footprints on the sands of time,
Show me the way
Where I could go
Where I could hide
Come Lord Jesus
And be my guide.

Chorus
Be my guide Lord
In Thee let me hide Lord
in the shadow of your valley
Let me abide
Where nothing is reasoning
And the way is life
Come Lord Jesus
And be my guide.

The prophet a great hunter
Thought he was a guide
He realised he was lost
On the mountain side
On the death-walk in the wilderness
And there He cried,
""Come Lord Jesus I'm no guide""."
1499;Guilty;G;"Guilty, I'm guilty I was born in sin, I'm guilty
Unworthy, I'm unworthy
I should've been cast aside
'Cause I'm unworthy, Mercy, I plead mercy
I believe what He did for me on Calvary
I'm praying I need Amazing Grace
If I find grace in Your eyes
Lord pardon me!!!

Pardon me, I need someone to pardon me
Forgive me, I need someone to forgive me
I'm like the thief on the cross
""Lord remember me""
If I find grace in your eyes, Lord pardon me.

Thankful, Lord I'm thankful
I've been born again, I'm thankful
Worthy, He made me worthy
He cleansed me by His blood
And He made me worthy
Mercy, I found mercy
I believe what He did for me on Calvary
Praying, I found amazing grace
Yes I found grace, He pardoned me."
1500;I Received The Invitation;;"I received the invitation
To the banquet of the Lord
But I could never stand before Him
His beauty I could not afford
For I looked down at my garments
So soiled and sinned by sin
I knew that in His sacred presence
I could never enter in

Chorus
Jesus gave me a beautiful robe to wear
Love beyond all measure
His garment to share
Spotless and Holy,
Beauty far beyond compare
For Jesus gave me 
His very own robe to wear.

Then my kind and loving Saviour
Heard my cry of deep despair
Then He said, ""I'll give unto you
My own robe to wear, 
You can rest within this promise
That the Father will be pleased
When that day you stand before Him,
And My Own garment He'll see""."
1501;Close Union;;"I want to have my ear
Tuned so that I can hear
And know its You that speaks to me
In the stillness of my heart
So much confusion now
Take me Lord and show me how
To walk with You just alone
Laying everything aside

Chorus
Walking in close union
Like You did with Adam
Lord You know my desire
To walk in sweet communion.

And in the cool of the day
When I bow my head to pray
Not to be just saying words
Communing friend to friend

And one day I will be 
With You for Eternity
We'll walk together hand in hand
And fellowship in love"
1502;How Gloriously Grace;;"How glorious the joy,
That I could obtain,
Salvation and honour,
Through His precious Name.
Not by my power
But Love took me in.
How graciously Grace
 has covered my sin.

Chorus
Mercy has granted,
 what works could not do.
When He made intercession,
 for me and for you.
And when He could not settle
The guilty within
How graciously grace,
 has covered my sin.

Oh! blood like a fountain
Has covered my sin
And peace like a river,
 beyond my control.
I stand in amazement and can't
 comprehend.
How graciously grace,
 has covered my sin"
1503;Arise And Possess;;"Arise and possess your inheritance
For this is the year of jubilee
Arise, be not entangled with the
 yoke of bondage.
Understand the Liberty
 by which Christ set you free.

Entangled with heavy chains of captivity,
Bruised and battered by sin,
Condemned and sentenced  
 to a life of bondage.
O God, there was no peace within
Then a sound was heard
It was like the abundance of rain
Saying ""Rejoice
 you have received the atonement,
Accept the pardoning Word
Which was provided for you
Because you are not of the bond woman
You're of the free

So aren't you tired of living under privileged?
Saints, don't you hear that sound?
Saying freedom to the captives
 restoration to the blind
Setting free those who are bruised.
Saints empty your vessels
Let Him fill them with oil
You are free, you are free, you are free.

So when the creditor comes 
 to take away your land
Show him your account
Settled long ago 
 by Calvary's Lamb
And say ""I am free, I am free, I am free"".

Now you can tell the world I'm free
I have heard the trumpet sound Jubilee;
Freedom from all burdens and sin
the comforter has given me peace within
And whom the Son as set free
Is free indeed
And whom the Son as set free
Is free indeed.
And whom the Son as set free
Is free indeed"
1504;Only Jesus To Satisfy;;"The world would try to satisfy,
That longing in your soul
You may search this whole world over
But you'll be just as before
You'll never find true satisfaction
Not until you find the Lord
For only Jesus can satisfy your soul.

Chorus
And only Jesus can satisfy your soul
And only He can change your life
 and make you whole.
He'll give you peace, you never knew,
Sweet Love and Joy and Heaven too
For only Jesus, can satisfy your soul.

If you could have the fame and fortune.
All the wealth you could attain,
Yet you have no Christ within you.
Your living here will be in vain
For there'll come a time 
 when death shall call you
Riches can not help you then
So come to Jesus, for only Him can satisfy."
1505;Dear Jesus;;"Dear Jesus, abide with me
As I travel life's troubled sea
And make my life
What it ought to be
Dear Jesus, abide with me.

Sometimes my way 
Seems rough and long
But the way to heaven
Is the way to God
My trials deep within my are sore
I see Jesus on the other shore"
1506;Thanks;F;"Thank You Lord for the strength  
You give, to simply carry on
Through those scolds and tests
And the worst and best
I'm never left alone,
You're always right beside me
To hear me when I pray
Since I first began
You've been my dearest friend
I give you all the praise

Chorus
Thanks, Thanks 
 I give You thanks
For all You've done, 
 I am so blessed
My soul has found rest
Oh Lord, I give you
 thanks

I give you thanks this moment
And I will continually
For each day I live, Your Grace You give,
I'm blessed abundantly
And I won't forget that moment
When in my life You made such a change
Since the Spirit came,
I've not been the same
I want to give You praise."
1507;Signs Of The Times;;"Years of time have come and gone
Since I first heard it told
How my Jesus would come 
 to earth some day,
If back then it seemed so real
then I just can't help but feel
How much closer His coming is today.

Chorus
Signs of the times are everywhere
There's a brand new feeling in the air,
So keep your eyes upon the eastern skies
Lift up your heads
Redemption draweth nigh.

Wars and strife on every hand
And violence fills our land
Still some folks doubt 
That my Jesus will come to earth again
But the Word of my God is so true
He'll redeem His chosen few
So do you lose hope,
Christ Jesus surely will return"
1508;The Great Exodus;Fm;"The Lord has called a great Exodus
 in this evil day.
For He promised in His Word that a people,
Must be changed and taken away;
Once again the Token is required of every man
As the Death Angel moves swiftly
 throughout the land,
For the plagues of Egypt are throughout the land,
Gross darkness on the people they don't
 understand
We are living in a time of mercy and judgement
We are living in a time of mercy and judgement.

The Mystery Cloud has shown 
 the Supreme Judge in our day.
He'll judge and make war with the evil scientists,
Who have despised His way,
They are corrupting and destroying the 
 earth with Satan wisdom,
They've made it a time bomb activated for 
 sure destruction;
But rejoice you saints who sigh and cry,
The Cloud has brought our redemption nigh;
You shall leap over walls into a new dimension
You shall leap over walls into a new dimension.

Volcanic lava shall spew forth 
 from the centre of the earth
A regeneration to a new civilisation,
The earth shall give birth
But like Noah, we shall be lifted 
 above the judgements again
When fire and hailstones 
Fall from the skies like rain;
For on the ashes of the wicked
Shall the righteous stand
The meek of the earth shall inherit the land
Oh rejoice ye citizens of New Jerusalem
Oh rejoice ye citizens of New Jerusalem.

Your tormentors and oppressors
 you shall see them no more,
For the Holy Fire of God's wrath shall make
 your exodus sure.
No more demons to disrupt and pollute
 our atmosphere
God will judge the earth
The rivers of water shall be crystal clear
Edenic beauty shall cover the earth again
No more sickness, no more sorrow, no more pain
God and man, heaven and earth will be one again.
God and man, heaven and earth will be one again."
1509;Jesus Keeps Me;;"I lived a life of sin and sorrow
Till I found the Lord
Jesus is my Saviour
He died on Calvary
I'll follow Him with all my heart
I love Him - yes I do
I can see a new bright future
Cause from sin He set me free

Chorus
Jesus - keeps me from all wrong
Jesus - He was God's begotten Son
Jesus, Sweetest Name I know
Jesus, He guides me as I go.

One day we'll hear a calling
We'll meet Him in the air
We'll fly up to heaven,
For the marriage supper there
For there is Peace forever
Upon that golden shore
To reign with Christ in heaven
And praise Him evermore"
1510;Ancient Of Days;A;"I beheld  the courts of heaven
Where great treason was opposed
Michael fought the great red Dragon
Who wanted to take control
Kicked out of heaven with 
 two thirds of the stars,
Like lightning they fell on the earth,
They mingled the seed of man,
And by deceit, they gained control.

Chorus
Until The Ancient of days did come
With experience maturity and wisdom
The Ancient of days did come
Restoring full dominion 
The Ancient of days did come
The Ancient of days did come
And we must overcome

I beheld this beast was wounded
But his deadly wound was healed
He cast down the truth, exalted a lie,
Having the whole world to be deceived.
I beheld till a Might Angel came
With an open book in His hand
He gave me skill and wisdom to understand
God's great mystery plan."
1511;Lord You Gave Me A Life;;"Lord you gave a life without sorrow
And a home where my problems are few
Lord if You don't fail to see this tomorrow
I would like to know that I have you

Chorus
Holding my hand, 
 that You only can hold me
Whispering peace, like no other can do
I won't worry for fame and fortune
If I only know that I have You.

And at last when this life is all over
And Jordan's stilling waters I view
And no matter who's standing around me
Lord I just want to know that I have You"
1512;Adam Where Are You;;"Unashamed and naked in a garden
That has never seen the rain
Rulers of a Kingdom, full of joy,
Never marred by any pain
the morning all around them 
 seems to celebrate
The life they've just began.

And in the majesty of innocence
The king and queen come
 walking in the sun
But the master of deception
Now begins with his dissection
 of the Word
And with all his craft and subtle
The serpent twists the simple truth 
 they've heard.

While hanging in the balance
Is a world that has been placed
 in command.
And all their unborn children die
As both of them bow down
 to Satan's hand.

But just before the evening
In the cool of the day
They hear the voice of God,
 as He is walking.
And they can't abide in His presence
So they tried to hide away
But still they hear the sound as He's calling

Adam, Adam where are you?
Adam, Adam where are you?
Adam, Adam I love you.

In the sparkling heat of summer now
The gardener and his wife are in the field
And it seems that thorns and thistles
Are the only crop that struggles every year
But all down through the ages
Can hear maker calling out His Name
Though the curse has long been broken
Adam's sons are still the prisoner of their fears

Rushing now to scatter to destruction,
With fingers in their ears,
While the Father's Voice is calling
With an urgency I never heard before
Coming from the darkness now
Before its time to finally close the door"
1513;Sealed;;"I know I've been sealed
 to the day of redemption
Jesus will come and take me away
And forever I'll be
 in that beautiful mansion
I'm gonna live with the Saints
In glory some day.

My life was overweighed
With burdens and cares
I had no one to comfort
My poor soul within
And I drifted afar
On life's stormy sea
And my life was all dark
And gloomy for me.

One day I heard of a man
Who died on the cross
To save a sin-sick-soul
In the whirlwinds of wars
One day I called on Jesus
His precious blood covered me
And Jesus lifted my burdens
And He set me free"
1514;Love Is The Greatest Gift;;"If I could speak like an angel
Or know what tomorrow may bring
If I had faith to move mountains
That wouldn't mean a thing
If I had all the world's knowledge
But turn away from His call

Chorus
Without His Love I am nothing
For Love is the greatest gift of all
Love is the greatest gift of all
Love is the greatest gift of all
With God's Love in my heart
I can be a shinning light
For Love is the greatest gift of all.

God's Love is never demanding
But always gentle and kind
God's Love is always forgiving
Leaving our past behind
As I look at the reflection
It makes me feel so small"
1515;Live Right;;"Blessed is the man
 whom the Lord will find
Doing His perfect will all the time
Though the mortal strength faileth
He's not weary yet
His labours of love the Lord 
 will never forget.

Chorus
We will live right everyday
Jesus can come now - Any day
We will live right everyday
Jesus can come now any day.

Blessed are your eyes 
 for the things that they see.
Many prophets of old
 have enquired diligently.
For no more darkly do we see
 but face to face
Lift your hands and praise the Lord
For amazing grace.

Blessed are your ears 
For the things that they hear.
Many uncertain sounds are everywhere
For the gospel trumpet sounded sweet
 jubilee
Lift your hands and praise the Lord
Who has set you free.

Gird up your loins ye mighty man of war
Full obedience to God's Word 
 and victory is sure.
For perfect faith is strong 
 and knows no defeat
For the god of this world
 must wriggle under our feet.

Punish with vengeance all iniquity
By confessing your faults with sincerity
You must say;-
""Satan you have no peace in me""
Let the royal vesture be now put on me."
1516;God Can Do Anything For You;;"When your problems get so heavy
And you think there's no way through
God can do anything for you

Chorus
God can do anything, anything, anything
God can do anything for you.
He's the Alpha and Omega
The beginning and the end
God can do anything for you.

He's a friend, when you're friendless
When you're lonely, when you're blue.
God can do anything for you.

He's the Lion that prevaileth
He's the mighty conqueror
God can do anything for you

He's the sweet Rose of Sharon
He's the Lily of the valley
God can do anything for you
I know He can do anything."
1517;I Trust In God;E;"I trust in God wherever I may be
Upon the land or on the rolling sea
For come what may, from day to day
My heavenly Father, watches over me.

I trust in God, I know He cares for me
On mountain peak, or on the stormy sea
Though billows roll, He keeps my soul
My heavenly Father, watches over me.

He makes the rose an object of His care
He guides the eagle through the pathless air
And surely He remembers me.
My heavenly Father, watches over me.

I trust in God for in the lion's den
On battle fields or in the prison pen
Through praise or blame
Through flood or flame
My heavenly Father, watches over me.

The valleys may be dark, the shadows deep
But Oh, the Shepherd guards His lonely sheep
And through the gloom, He'll lead me home.
My heavenly Father, watches over me."
1518;Somewhere;;"Somewhere! somewhere! somewhere!
Just across the Jordan river
Is a place of everlasting joy and peace
Where the tree of life is blooming there
 forever,
And the crown of life is waiting
 there for me.

Chorus
And that sounds like home to me
That's where I want to be
There'll be no tears to fill our eyes again
The hills will echo with the story
As we sing of His Love and glory 
Where the Saints of God will be
That sounds like home to me

They say there is mansions there
 inside that City
A crystal river flowing by the tree of life
No pain nor disappointments there
 to hurt us
And Jesus Christ Himself will be the light

Singing victory
Victory and glory for all eternity
Its a promise of God to us
Victory and glory for all eternity
Hallelujah
Victory and glory for all eternity
We'll sing it forever
Victory and glory for all eternity
Victory and glory for all eternity"
1519;Whispering Hope;;"Soft as the voice of an angel
Breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers her comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over
Wait till the sunshine is done
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow
After the shower is gone

Chorus
Whispering hope
Oh! How welcome thy voice
Making my heart
In its sorrow rejoice.

Hope an anchor's steadfast
Rends the dark veil of the soul
Whiter the Master has entered
Robbing the grave of its soul
Come then O come, glad fruition
Come to my weary heart
Come O Thou lest hope glory
Never O never depart"
1520;Jerusalem - And I Am The One To Blame;;"The City was Jerusalem
The time was long ago
The people called Him Jesus
The crime was the Love
 that He showed.

Chorus
And I am the one to blame
I caused all the pain
He hurt Himself
the day He wore my crown

He brought me love that
No-one else could give
I brought Him cause to cry
Though He taught me how to live
I taught Him how to die

He could have called a legion of angels
And said, ""Take me away,
Please take me away"".
He could have said, ""I'm not guilty
So I'm not gonna stay,
I'm not gonna pay"".

But He walked right through the gate
Then on up a hill
And as He bowed beneath the weight
He cried, ""Father not my will""."
1521;Why Are The Roses So Red;;"In Eden there bloomed a flower so red
Until the time of Cain
But until the woman's promised seed
It was not seen again

Chorus
Why are roses so red
And why all leaves so green
Because it was God who gave
His own life
And His blood made
The crimson stain

Jesus the Rose of Sharon so fair
He is God's tree so green
The One that Moses found one day
That could make life's water clean

The bride tree blooms again my friend
Once more her leaves are green
The Bridegroom's life now lives in her
And with eyes to seek and be seen

When the earth as a rose
Shall bloom once more
And the child with lion is seen
The question in song as they walk along
Will be this lovely refrain"
1522;It's Not Good For A Man;;"From he dust of the earth 
God fomed a man
And he gave him breath
Of life for need to stand
The garden by the river
Was his home
God said it is not good that he's alone

So the Lord put birds and beasts 
Upon the land 
And called them all to pass to 
 before the man
And Adam gave names to ech and all
But in the end he stood among them 
 all alone

So the Lord put a sleep upon the man
And took a rib from Adam with his hands
Then he built a living woman from
 the bone because it was not good 
For a man to be alone

It's not good for a man to be alone
So much to share 
Too much to that's never known
She'll be closer than a friend
His flesh and bone 
It's not good for a man to be alone

When God brought her to the man
He took her hand
Adam said, ""Since you were taken out of man 
Woman is your name my flesh and my bone""
It's not good for a man to be alone

So man shall leave his mother and his  father 
All he is and all he has  
 becomes their own
For she's flesh made of his flesh
Bone of his bone
It's not good for a man to be alone"

1525;Come Unto Jesus;;"Oh I know there are 
 things in your life
You think He can't forgive
But I know He will forgive
And forget my friend
And show you how to live.

Chorus
Come unto Jesus
Give Him your life today
Come unto Jesus
Let Him have His way
(Be a brand new man)

Don't you put it off my friend
You can't afford to wait
Today is the day for you
Soon it will be took late

The prophet came 
and preached the seven seals
That's the Word for this final age
The  Bride is called 
 and sealed within
You better stay in line"
1526;I Am A Pilgrim;;"I am a pilgrim but not a rambler
There's a pathway meant just for me
I only fumble when I wont follow
I only stumble when I won't see

Chorus
Light of life
Shine on my pathway
Shepherd call me
Call me down the road
I am coming, I am coming
Though I bend beneath my load

I am a stranger but not an orphan
There is a mansion prepared for me
I'm going home now to meet my Father
I am a member of His family

I am a pilgrim but not a rambler
And I'm on my way home
I am a stranger but not an orphan
And I'm on my way home"
1527;It's Good To See;;"It's good to see
A young couple marry
For it reminds us of Christ
 and His Bride
How that He'll take her
 to the marriage supper
Over there to be ever 
 at His side.

Chorus
Oh what a day that's gonna be
When we see Jesus
And get married 
 to the precious Son of God
And we'll be so happy there,
That our lives were spent for Him
When He takes us to be ever
 at His side

As this couple joins together
 in holy union
Let us pray the God's love
Will be their guide
And that He will always stay beside her
And that she will ever be at His side"
1528;I Stand Amazed;;"I stand amazed about
His great salvation
The King of kings
Redeems a fallen man
How He restores a soul
 by sin disfigured
And this has been
Included in His plan.

Chorus
I stand amazed
When someone tells the story
Of Christ's great love
And how He took my place
He died upon the cross
Oh how I praise Him
I am redeemed 
behold I stand amazed

I stand amazed about 
His Holy Spirit
It comforts hearts 
When disappointments come
And strength renews
Each time we fight the battle
And grace to stand
Until He calls us home."
1529;Through My Tears;;"Years I lived for a long time
Saw no need to have a Saviour
Hopelessly I wondered on 
 in dread and fear
And then one day I saw a cross
And I cried to God for mercy
He forgave and rescued me
 through my tears.

Through' my tears, I met the Saviour
Through my tears, I saw the light
Through' my tears I see
 heaven's gates unfolding
To that land where there'll 
 be no more tears

All alone and on my knees
to the Word I pray and in earnest
Why the skies should seem 
 so dark and oh so dreary
Then comes the dawn
And I behold His loving face
 still watching over me
I see it all, as He planned
 through my tears."
1530;Restore To Me The Joy;;"I seem to loose the strength I've had before
I need the leadership of Your Spirit even more
Oh Lord You know I feel alone
I don't ever want to be on my own anymore
And yet I know that something lays ahead
And if I yield to the Spirit I'll be led
Within the perfect will of God
I His glory I will trust forevermore

Restore to me the joy of my salvation
Reveal to me the secrets of your heart
If I could learn to understand Thee
I'd see how great Thou art."
1531;Zeal Of My Father;;"Who shall tame those beasts
Who will guard the throne
It's the five fold ministry
The voice of many waters
Thunderbolts and lightning
Screaming from the pulpit
Stay in line, (stay in line)
To escape the bottomless pit

Chorus
For the zeal of my Father's house
Has eaten them up
For the zeal of my Father's house
Has eaten them up
Obedience just to do the will
The will of God, the will of God

Man anointed to see a church 
 come to perfection
Without spot or wrinkle
Where no sin can dwell among them
With power to bind the mamba
And loose God's people from its power
To raise the sleeping Saints
In this hour of the rapture.

Hence forth we shall be no more
Children tossed to and fro
Or carried about by every wind 
 of doctrine that blows,
Or having an understanding
 not good for being in the run
Under defy seeds of Satan
 that he set to destroy us.

And the voice which 
 I heard from heaven
Spake unto me saying
""Go and take the little book""
And I went unto Him and said
""Give me the book""
He said, ""Take it, eat it, it shall 
be in thine mouth sweet as honey
And bitter in thine belly""

And out of the throne proceedeth forth
Lightning, thundering and voices
And there were seven lamps of fire burning
 before the throne
Which are the Seven Spirits of God
Before the throne was a sea of glass
Like unto crystal and in the midst 
 of the throne

And round about it were four beasts
Full of eyes before and behind
And the first beast was like unto a lion
 and the second beast like a calf
And the third beast had a face as a man
And the forth like a flying eagle."
1532;2000 Years Ago;;"My friend if you will listen
I'd like to talk to you
I've got someone that I would
 like to introduce to you
Who left His home in glory,
 and came to earth below
He died on the cross for you 
 and for me 2000 years ago.

Chorus
2000 years ago
 and today He's still the same
I feel the joy inside of me
Each time I hear His name
If I had to pay for all my sins
Oh! what a debt I owed
But Jesus paid it all for me
2000 years ago.

It's a lovely life, since He came in 
 and took control of me.
I'll praise the name of Jesus
Through all eternity
The world may think I'm fooling
But oh! I live Him so
Because of what He did for me
2000 years ago"
1533;Changing Robes;G;"Have faith don't worry now,
Everything is gonna be alright,
This mortal shall put on immortality
We'll no longer be earth-bound
But we'll be heaven bound
We'll slip from time into eternity
That's why,

Chorus
I'm laying aside the old man
Putting on the new man
I'm changing robes 
 for another dimension.

I've heard the Bridegroom call,
And I've received my invitation
This robe is so snowy white,
It fits me just right
Because it was furnished 
 by the Bridegroom
Now there's set before me
An open door to the wedding supper.

I'm making all my wrongs right
Got to have my lamp trimmed
And my fire burning bright;
You see I don't want no trouble
Down by the river 
I want to be ready to cross over
The Shout was heard
We're in the Voice now
And very soon the trumpet shall sound!

Now I'm ascending into a higher order
Far above all principalities and powers
Far above corruption into incorruption
Far above mortal into immortality."
1534;What More Do You Want;;"There's a man, His name
His name is Jesus
He used to live in this world
 we are going through.
He died and He's gone
 to prepare a place for you
What more do you want Him to do?

Chorus
What more do you want Him to do?
To prove that He loves you so
He died on the cross to save,
 save your soul
What more do you want Him to do?

Sinner man can't you see
That Jesus loves you
Can't you see, 
Oh! He died for you
If you're sick He'll make you well
And save your soul from hell
What more do you want Him to do?

In this world we live in, we have trials
But if you only keep your faith
He will take you through
Keep trusting in His name
And don't you be ashamed
What more do you want Him to do?"
1535;Arise And Be Doing;Em;"Oh, prisoners of Love,
The Master has need of thee
Who shall build the Lord's house
A magnificent sanctuary?
But a people He has chosen
To bear His Name
Yesterday, today and forever
His awesome power remains the same.

Arise and be doing
And the Lord be with thee,
Who shall build the Lord's House
A magnificent sanctuary?
Arise, and be doing
And the Lord be with thee
We shall build the Lord's house
A magnificent sanctuary.

""Come forth My sons,
 with wisdom and skill
My anointing is on thee,
Who shall lay any hindrance
When I've ordained the victory?
Take your hammer and sword,
Be thou courageous and strong
Only believe My Word
And a paradox I will perform""

""Take My yoke, My love slave,
For it's easy and My burden's light""
Who shall serve the Lord Thy God,
With all his soul and strength and might?
But His people He has taken
From the depths of the miry clay,
Let every lively stone in His building
Find its perfect place."

1538;Consider Him;F;"I have to sing to you
About the One who died for me
Even though I have failed, 
Yet His Love's still being 
expressed to me
In my time of trail and when the 
enermy assails
I draw back just a little while
To consider Him

Consider Him who for the joy
endured the cross,
Consider Him who died
for all that was lost;
Consider Him who there on 
Calvary bore my pain
I want you just for a little while
To consider Him

I know that life is rough
Sometimes the trials hard to bear
And your daily life is encumbered
With a load of care;
Then there are those times when
You can't seem to bear the strain,
I want you just for a little while
To consider Him"
1539;Jesus Will Take Care;;"Have you ever been so distressed
When you see your circumstances
 look so gloomy
And the tears begin to cover your eyes,
Remember Jesus will take care of you.

He's the Rock of all the ages
He's the light in the darkest night
A comfort when there's no one left
 to take care
So you don't look at your circumstances
They will only bring you down

Remember Jesus will take care of you
When you feel so weak and can't go on
And the devil, he tempts you sore
But if you only call upon Jesus
He will answer."
1540;Special Mountain;;"I long to see Jesus,
Just a glimpse of Him
 cannot satisfy,
I just want to love Him

CHORUS
For there’s just something special
about that mountain,
Though many valleys to cross
He’s more than worth the pain,
There’s just something special 
 about that mountain,
I’m just ready to fight
One more time again.

I long for deeper fellowship
With the One who has chosen me to
bear His name.
I just want to be faithful,
Just to love and serve Him again and
again.

I long for the fullness of Eternal Life
To share a glory that will never fade
away;
And I long for my precious new body
Where no sickness or pain would ever
be again.

I long for full dominion,
It’s my inheritance, a son of God I am;
I long to go back to Eden,
It’s my future home where I’ll
always be.

For there’s just something special
about that mountain,
Though many valleys to cross
He’s more than worth the pain.
There’s just something special about
that mountain,

I’m just ready to fight.
One more time again,
...Give me courage Lord,
...More of Your strength Lord,
...I’m more than able Lord"
1541;Keep Me Close To The Foot Of Calvary;;"When the earth and its turmoil
 surrounds me
And the cares of this life are all I see
Remind me dear Lord
 of where I should be
Keep me close to the foot
 of Calvary

Chorus
Keep me close to the foot of the cross
I surrender my will whatever the cost
Draw me closer, let me see
 where you suffered and bled for me
Keep me close to the foot of the cross
Keep me close to the foot of the cross

All around me are those who have lost
Their love for the Saviour and its cost 
 help me dear Lord
To listen to Thee
Lead them back to the foot of Calvary

Your love led the way to 
 the rugged cross
On a hill you died for my sins
Your suffering days laid 
 the depth for all man
How great is your love for me

Before you one day I will stand
And I will answer for the 
 life that I have lived
So lead me dear Lord
And let me follow Thee
Keep me close to the foot of Calvary
Keep me close to the foot of Calvary"
1542;So Let Me Walk With You Jesus;;"You found me, 
 when I was so lonely,
You found me,
 when I was so blue
You found me
 when no one could help me
When no one 
 knew just what to do.

Chorus
So let me walk with You Jesus
Don't ever, ever leave me alone
For without You,
 I know I could never.
No never, make heaven my home.

I've been on the mountain
 with Jesus,
I've been in the valley so low.
But never, one time 
 has He failed me.
To Him, with my troubles I go."

But thank God your grace
Has indeed really found me
And you gave to me
Eye salve that I may see
How great you are
And what you’ve made me to be

Full redemption
I found grace in a time of judgment
The stone that the builders rejected
Has become the chief stone of my life
And He has gone to prepare a
place
That where He is I’ll be there
For all eternity.

I see a world held in darkness
O there is so much evil around me
But Lord with you I am standing
For I know that soon your Kingdom
Will be ushered in
Continue to break
Every kingdom in my heart
Till I only be your living word
manifested

Full redemption
I found grace in a time of judgment
The stone that the builders rejected
Has become the chief stone of my life
And He has gone to prepare a
place
That where he is I’ll be there
For all eternity.

I’m waiting with great expectation
For my Lord,
Who I’ll see
Soon I will slip from time
Into eternity.

Full redemption
Lord I thank you for your grace that
found me
Full restoration you promise
Lord I hold thy word close to my
heart

Soon I will be in that perfect place
Where there’s no more time
No sorrow
No more sickness and pain
No more sin and temptation
Only peace, joy and love
For all eternity
For all eternity"
1545;Trust In The Lord;A;"Trust in the Lord
With all thine heart;
And lean not to thine own
understanding;
But in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him and
He shall direct thy path.

Are you searching for solutions
Are the answers so hard to find
Are the pressures of life
 getting you down.
And you need some peace of mind
Why dont you cast your cares
 on Jesus
For you know He cares for you.
Is there anything too hard for Him
That He can not do.

I've had my share of troubles
I've had some ups and downs
I've gone through some trials 
 and tribulations
And God knows I've had to sigh
But in every situation
My God always pulled me through
And if you put your trust in Him
He'll do the same for you

Trust Him, trust Him,
And thou shall find good favour,
and good understanding;
Trust Him, trust Him,
And He shall direct thy path."
1546;It Is God;D;"It was at the place of the Holy cross
Were God took his servant
   and turned him around
He came back home to friends 
  and family
To share with them this message
  of jubilee
Well, one by one they came 
  till a church was born
It surely was the breaking 
  of a new dawn

Chorus
It has been God 
  who passed our way
And it is God 
  who is with us here today
It has been God 
  who passed our way
And it is God 
  who is with us here today

We gathered at a scouts hall in Belvedere
With planks on bricks for benches
  and a pulpit made of pan
Till we move up to the house in 
  Meyrick Park,
To give witness at the place
 where God took us from
Then amidst the voice 
  of those who lived near
A building was erected and
 we worship God there

Well, the work was truly growing
  and the time came 
We moved up to the place
   of the burning flame
To unite with saints 
  who were to be
A part of this great work 
  that God did start
Well, mighty revelations
   thundered from that place
And around the world it went 
  with shouting of grace

Our God is a Father
   he cares for old and young
And He has given this place 
  for our little ones
As prisoners we stand
  right on this spot
We know its a transformation
  from what it was
Though tillers of the soil
  are all around
There still an Abel in our midst with
a bloody Lamb

It seem we were set 
  and just ready to go
But more of God’s great plan
   began to unfold
The saints from deep in south
Has come to take their place
  amongst now
And as we wait, we wait right here
We are just waiting to be caught up,
  caught up in the air."
1547;Keep Your Minds Stayed On Me;C;"Restless heart, troubled mind
I try hard to find answers
To why its turned out this way
But while my heart's grieved with fear
I can feel Him draw near
Gently I hear my Lord say

Chorus
Keep your mind stayed on me
Stayed on me
Faithfully and I will give you
Perfect peace, sweet release
If you just keep your mind
Stayed on me

It's evening time the hour's late
There is a pressure so great
Everywhere hearts fail
 because of fear.
Oh but when I think of higher things
All the peace His Word brings
A still small Voice I can hear."
1548;I Just Came Say To Thank You;C;"Lord, I didn’t come here
To ask You for anything,
Lord, I just want to say, 
Thank You Lord.
You answered a million prayers, 
  oh God
That I forgot to thank You for,
Lord, I just want to say, 
Thank You Lord.

CHORUS
For maybe tomorrow
I’ll have troubles and sorrows,
And a thousand tears may fall,
But until I face tomorrow’s test
I’ll have no special favours to ask
Lord, I just want to say, 
Thank You Lord.

You’ve been so good,
And You’ve been so kind,
I’m so grateful Lord,
I’m so grateful Father,
You kept us in our right minds.
Many times we didn’t know 
 what to do,
But You always brought us through,
We come today Lord,
We come today Father,
Just to say, Thank You Lord.

You gave us eyes to see,
When we were bound, 
You set us free,
We can’t forget Lord,
All of the things that You have done.
Lord, we travelled by land
And we travelled by air,
I know You kept us Lord,
You kept us from harm, hurt and
danger."
1549;What Will You Present;C;"I want to present the life of Christ,
It’s my aim today,
For in His image I want to stand
So blameless on that day;
And though this world may criticize,
It will never understand,
That I can’t rest until I be
A perfect man.

CHORUS
What are you going to present 
 to the Lord
At the end of your journey?
He’s not going to be touched by
anything
Save His testimony.
What are you going to present to the
Lord?
I hope it makes you sigh and cry,
Don’t be found in that position
Where you would be wondering why.

Though the world may offer its
pleasure and peace,
And its luxurious life of ease,
But it simply cannot continue on
For man’s just like a breeze;
A moment here and a moment gone,
Like a flower he fades away,
But I just want to stay right on
To that perfect day.

Take rest my soul, in no other arms
Save Jesus own today
For He has opened my eyes to see
That judgement is on its way;
And though ten thousand fall at my
side
I will never be tossed aside;
For in the shadow of that mighty rock
is where I’ll abide.

Lord take Thy Word, Thy precious
Word,
And anoint it to my soul;
Perfect what is lacking in my faith
And make thy servant whole.
Drive all fears and all doubts away,
For I just want to hear You say,
Receive thy crown my beloved son
You have overcome, well done!”"
1550;I Will Restore;D;"Bride, Do you remember
Way back to your former rain
When you once, stood in position
Having dominion and all things
under your feet
But you fell, 
you fell from that fellowship
And you wondered, 
where you went wrong
So you cry out, you thirst for that
latter rain
And you’ll fight for that power again.
You see the palmerworm, came in
your life and ate
Then the cankerworm came in your
life and ate
Then the caterpillar and locust ate
But God promised, yes he promised

CHORUS
That I will restore saith the Lord (2x)
Jehovah promised the Holy Ghost
promised.
I will restore thus saith the Lord (2x)

Power shall come from on high
After the Holy Ghost comes upon
you
You shall be witness unto me
throughout the world
My glory all men shall behold
For I shall come, unto you as the
former rain
As the latter rain to you shall I come
And all men shall know.
That you have the evidence
That Jesus rose from the dead
And in your own atmosphere.
God will visit you there
For you were meant to be mighty
men of valour and he promised"

We’ve been made a spectacle
 to this world today,
The Life of Jesus being on display;
Our resurrected Christ.
Awaken Jesus to the scene again,
As He glorifies His Name once again
in His children.

Let’s press on daily with the King’s
Sword in our hand,
Defeating the enemy on every hand;
So ride on Thy Majesty to 
Thy rightful place
On the throne of our hearts;
Of this kingdom, 
He rose us up to be a part.

We know that today 
 the Word is in the Bride
It’s Jesus again on His second ride;
Let’s bring our King, 
Our rejected King,
A clean fresh drink,
By living worthy of this gospel
We worship Him"

And the true Bride of Christ
Will soon fall into line"

There is a great magnet
Drawing from above
And there's nothing
Can hold me here below

Him in the air
When the final call comes 
For me to go

As I gaze into 
The starlit sky above
How I marvel at 
The lovely works of God
Just to know that
He is living in my soul
Its the greatest gift 
Any man could have"

It'll be worth every mile
  of the trip

Well I stood at the bedside
Of a christian departing
And I heard these last words
  from his lips
I see a crimson stream flowing
Feel the gentle breeze blowing
And its worth every mile
  of the trip"
1555;Many Waters;G;"There are so many people
in the world today
Don’t really know what
true love is;
Many have searched the
whole wide world
And still can’t seem
to find it.

Love is patient, love is kind,
True love can never be broken;
Love beareth all things,
Love suffers long.
Love is God and God is love,
Who is our King;
But how can you know true love
Without knowing Him?

CHORUS
Many waters cannot }
quench love, }
Neither can the floods }
drown it, }3x
Whosoever God joins
together,
Let no man put asunder.

Therefore shall a man leave father
and mother
And cleave unto his wife,
Then they shall be no more twain
But they shall be one.
Then he’ll love his bride as Christ the
church,

Who giveth Himself for it;
For no man yet hateth his flesh,
But loveth and cherisheth it.
Love is God and God is love,
Who is our King;
So how can you know true love
Without knowing Him"
1556;Jesus I Want To Praise;D;"Jesus, I just want to Praise You,

And you made me whole
You made a way
Like you said you would
I love you for being so good."
1557;He Dropped The Charges;G;"I was guilty of all the charges,
doomed in disgrace,
But Jesus with His special love saved
me by His grace;
He pleaded and He pleaded, He
pleaded my case,
Jesus dropped the charges, Jesus
dropped the charges,
Now I’m saved through grace and
faith.

Chorus
He dropped the charges,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Although I was wrong,
He dropped the charges,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Showed me right from wrong,
He dropped the charges,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Cast them all away.

I was guilty for so long,
Lived in sin too long,
But Jesus with His special love,
Reached down with His arm so
strong;
He picked me up and turned me
around,
Gave me a brand new song,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Now to Him I belong.

We may remember and remember,
All of the things we’ve done,
But Jesus with His special love,
Forgave us of every one;
He put me on the right road,
Lifted my heavy load,
Jesus dropped the charges,
Now I’m free down in my soul.


At Calvary I heard Him say,
At Calvary I heard Him say,
At Calvary I heard Him say,
Case dismissed, case dismissed,
Saved by grace."
1558;Total Praise;B;"Lord I will lift my eyes to the hills

Amen!!!"
1559;Forever Grateful;G;"You didn't wait for me
To draw near to You
But You clothed Yourself

To cry out to You
But You let me hear Your Voice
 calling me

Chorus
I'm forever grateful
Lord to You
I'm forever grateful
For the cross
I'm forever grateful to You
That You came to seek 
 and save the lost

You did not have to open
The great book of Ruth
But Lord we found great favour
In Your eyes
You did not have to place
The wedding band on our hand
But You did it Lord 
 because You love us all"
1560;One Life;;"It matters so little how much you may own
The places you have been to 
Or the people you've known
For it all comes to nothing
When placed at His feet.
It's nothing to Jesus, just memories to keep
You may take all treasures from far away land
Take all riches you can hold in your hands
Take all the pleasures riches can buy
But what will you have when it's your time to die

Chorus
Only one life so soon it will pass
Only what's done for Christ will last
And only one chance to do His will
So give to Jesus all your days
Its the only life that pays
When you recall you have but one life.

The days pass so quickly
The months come and go
The years melt away like a new fall of snow
Spring turns to summer, summer to fall
Autumn brings winter,
Then death comes to pass"
1561;From A Distance;;"From a distance
The world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountain wide
From a distance,
 the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flying

From a distance there's harmony
And He echoes through the land
It's the Voice of hope
It's the Voice of peace
It's the Voice of every man

From a distance, we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there's no wars
No wrongs and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance, we are instruments
Marching in a harmony band
Playing songs of hope
Playing songs of peace

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us
From a distance

From a distance, you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance, I just can not comprehend
What's all this fighting's for.

From a distance we have harmony
And He echoes through the land
It's the Love of loves
It's the Hope of hopes
It's the song of every man"
1562;Lord Will Make A Way;;"Like a ship that's tossed and drifted
Battered by an angry sea
When the sea of life all raging
And the fear falls on me
I wonder what I have done 
 that makes the straight so hard to run
But I say to my soul be patient 
The Lord will make a way somehow

The Lord will make a way somehow
When beneath the cross I bow
He will take away each sorrow
Let Him have your burden now
When the load bows down so heavy
The weight is on upon the brow
There's a sweet relief in knowing
The Lord will make a way somehow

Try to do my best in serving
Try to do the best I can
When I choose to do the right thing
Evil is present on every hand
Oh! I look up and wonder why
That fortune seems to pass me by
But I say to my soul take courage
The Lord will make a way somehow

Often there's misunderstanding
How to see the good I do
Some to bring some consolation
I find him complaining too
So many nights I toss in pain
Wondering what the day will bring
But I say to my soul take courage
The Lord will make a way somehow"
1563;Lord Draw Me Nearer;;"At times I feel so low, living on my own
And peace of mind is very hard to find
But when I call on You,
A Friend who is always true
You comfort me 
And leave my cares behind.

Chorus
Lord draw me nearer, to Your side
In Your presence, may I humbly hide
And grant me strength
To face the coming day
And mercy, to know Your Grace
Just hew me with Your Word
And draw me close to Thee

At times I've been deceived
I could feel the spirit leave
And I'd fall down on my knees
 to God and pray
Lord lift me up from sin
Let Your Spirit reign within
But most of all
 just draw me close to Thee."
1564;The Water Of Life;;"Most of my life, 
I've been filled with despair
Everything seems to slip by me.
Sin ruled my heart
 and a great fear filled my soul
Then I drank at the well 
 of mercy

Chorus
The water of life, 
 gave me strength to go on
He opened my eyes 
 and the darkness did go
And now there is Sunshine
And Love in my heart
Something inside me is singing
The thirst in my soul 
 now is quenched everyday.
As I drank at the well of His Mercy.

Now if you are thirst
 you come drink at this well
You will never thirst again
Like the woman at the well
Jesus spoke to that day
Said, ""Come drink at the Well
 of Mercy."""
1565;Summit Of The Seventh Peak;D;"We have seen the Lord
In the fulfillment of His Word.
He promised through the prophet
 to return,
To ride this trail again,
 to reveal His New Name;
To teach His Bride to prophesy again.

Chorus
Coming from the east, coming from
the west,
Coming from the north and from the
south;
All the rainbow trouts are gathered by
the Shout;
For adoption on the summit of the
Seventh Peak.

We are on Mount Zion, in the secret
place,
By the Sovereign Grace of our Lord;
A City on a hill whose glory can’t be
hid,
We’ll manifest the great and final pull.

A Rainbow-covenanted One,
In the Joshua Commission
Testifies, ""She has turned at the west"",
With the authority for her ministry,
And she shall speak from the Summit
of the Seventh Peak.

We sing a brand new song,
We are the blood-washed throng,
We’ve seen our names beneath the
Seventh Seal.
He opened up to us all the mysteries,
And there’s light now on the Summit
of the Seventh Peak.

For things are ready now
Father let the fire fall
Father, glorify Thy Name
You did it once before
In the life of Malachi 4
So Father glorify Thy Name again

Coming from the east, coming from
the west,
Coming from the north and from the
south;
All the rainbow trouts are transformed by
the Shout;
To do the greater works on the 
Summit of the Seventh Peak"
1566;God En Morphe;G;"Jehovah of the Old is Jesus of the New,
That’s the mighty revelation,
That has come to me and you;
How Michael, The Archangel, is the
pillar of Fire too,
He was the Voice in the whirlwind
That spoke Alaska’s doom;
He is the Amber Light, the Pillar of Cloud,
Came down on the wings of a
 snowwhite Dove;
He’s Jesus, The Lord of Lords.

He came back in this day
In the ringed-cloud mystery,
It was seen up in the skies,
And baffled the worldwide;
But to His little Bride He said:
“It’s I, you need not fear,
Just go back to the east
And I will meet you over there;
He is The Angel of God with the
silver-sword,
The One that meant the most with the
swept-back wings;
He’s Jesus the King of kings.

He was seen in Revelation,
The Book of great symbols;
As The mighty Angel that came down,
Was clothed in a cloud;
But, do you know He has promised
All the mysteries would be revealed?
The dying Lamb of Calvary was the
One that broke those Seals;
He is the Lion that prevailed,
The Lamb that was slain to take the
book from the hand of God;
He’s Jesus called The Word of God.

Who is this Melchisedec who’s
always changing form,
This mysterious One of the Bible
is hid to us no more;
His name is called the Word of God,
His vesture’s dipped in blood;
He raised us as His standard
When the enemy comes like a flood;
He is the Supreme Judge, the Angel of God,
The Man that stepped out of the ball of fire,
The Amber Light, the Great I AM,
The God that came walking in the
days of Sodom;
He’s Jesus, He’s JVHU."

1569;That's Why I Call You;;"You gave me time
When no-one gave time of day
You looked deep inside,
While the rest of the world looked away
You smiled at me
When there were just frowns everywhere
You gave me Love
When nobody gave a prayer

Chorus
That's why I call You Saviour
That's why I call You Friend
You touched my heart
You touched my soul
And helped me start all over again
That's why I love You Jesus
That's why I'll always care
You gave me love
When nobody gave a prayer

You gave me laughter,
After I cried all my tears
You heard all my dreams,
While the rest of the world closed its ears
I looked in Your eyes
And I found the tenderness there
You gave me love
When nobody gave a prayer"

 crazy rainbows,
And are you tired of spinning
 round and round?

Give them all, Give them all
Give them all to Jesus
Shattered dreams, mourning heart
 and broken soul
Give them all, Give them all
Give them all to Jesus
And He will turn your sorrow
 into joy.

He never said there'll always 
 be sunshine

 there'll be no rain

 of thanking
About the very thing
 that was proclaimed."
1571;Pass It On;;"It only takes a spark
 to get the fire going.
And soon all those around
Can warm up in its glowing
That's how it is with God's Love,
Once you have experienced it
You spread His Love to everyone
You want to pass it on.

What a wondrous time is spring
When all trees are budding
The birds begin to sing
The flowers start their blooming
That's how it is with God's Love,
Once you have experienced it
You want to sing, its fresh like spring
You want to pass it on.

I wish for you my friend,
This happiness that I've found
You can depend on Him,
It matters not where you're bound

I want to pass it on."

 removed the clouds from my eyes
And I saw a face so kind

Chorus
And when You found me
 I found everything.
You found an empty heart
I found Your Love to prove it 
Lord, You found a soul
Needed to be loved
I found what I had been searching for,
In You all along

Sweet Jesus, guide my feet
 close to Thee.
Let me love my neighbour

That I have found out its glow
Reach all those around
So they could see and know."

in the by and by.
We'll talk it over
my Lord and I
I'll ask the reason,
He'll tell me why
When we talk it over
In the by and by

I'll trust His leading,
He'll never fail
Through darkness tunnels
or misty veil
Obey His bidding
and faithful be
Though only one step
ahead I see."
1574;That's His Way Of Telling Me;;"He lets me walk down
 roads of disappointments.
He watches and He knows
 what's best for me.
The more I cry, the better He can
 mould me
And change my life completely
 that it will do His perfect will

 all human understanding
And I won't question trials

 through my darkest trials
And my greatest joy is knowing
 that He can trust in me."

Seek till you’re filled with power;
Seek on saints
Till His Spirit in you is endowed,
It’s been revealed,
This is the final hour;
And soon His Bride, His Chosen One
Will go on home.

Unmerited the favour 
that He granted me
To bring me home today, 
His very Own;
’Twas love, ’twas Grace
That stooped so low to conquer me;
My Sovereign Lord gave 
Sovereign Grace
To redeem me.

And now I’m home, His robe’s
wrapped around me;
This land is mine, 
this Promise is for me.
Amazing grace, amazing love
Christ poured on me,
His Word went with a promise,
One day we shall meet."

But I'm living in the light

There are so many things 
I am thankful for
All the needs you meet

You are Lord of all"

 Almighty God
There's hunger deep inside my soul
Only in Your presence
Is my heart and flesh restored
How lovely

In Your courts and shelter
For the greatest and the small
The sparrow has a place
To build her nest

The pilgrims find refreshments
In the grapes of old
And each one has the strength
To meet more days

A single day is better
Which is spent in a humble place
Than a thousand years
 of weeping without You.

The Lord bestows His favour
On each one who obeys
And blessings on the man
Who's on His truth"
1579;My Desire;;"Lord when You placed your hand
 upon me
I knew that I could never be the same
For in that moment I became
 Your servant
And still today, I only have one aim.

My soul desire, is to be used.
An empty vessel longing
 to be filled by You.
My soul desire is to serve You Lord
To do Your perfect will
To work each day and build
 Your Kingdom
This is my desire

Lord I do not seek to claim the glory
I only wish to be under Thine control
For I know that Thou alone art worthy
And it's Thee who placed this longing 
 in my soul."

Hear me oh Saviour Divine
Open the fountain
And cleanse me, Lord
Give me a heart like Thine.

Only a greater veil of tears
Things of this world
Oh Lord I resign
Lord give me a heart like Thine."
1581;When It Rains It Pours;;"When it rains, it pours
Sometimes rough billows roll
Just speak to Jesus

I'm so glad, Jesus Knows

There are times,
 that I get discouraged
Trying to carry, each heavy load
But I decided, to keep on calling
I'm so glad, Jesus knows

There are times, 
 we're falsely accused
All because of what someone told
They wont believe in you
 no matter what you do.
I'm so glad, Jesus knows

When there are troubles
 in your home
When deep down in your heart
 you know yourself
You've done wrong
Give it to Jesus, He'll take control
Yes He will
In that big heaven, Jesus knows."
1582;No One Ever Cares;A;"I would love to tell you what
 I think of Jesus,
Since I’ve found in Him a friend 
 so kind and true.
I would tell you how 
He changed my life completely,
He did something that 
 no other friend can do.

Chorus
No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
There’s no other friend so kind as He,
No one else could take the sin and
darkness from me,
Oh how much He cares for me.

My life was full of sin
When Jesus found me
All my heart was full of 
 misery and woe
But the Master placed
His strong arms around me
And He led me in the way
 I ought to go.

Every day He comes to me
 with new assurance,
More and more I understand 
His words of Life.
I would never know just 
why He came to save me,
Till someday soon I’ll see 
His blessed face above."
1583;I Will Raise Him Up;;"I am the Bread of Life
He who comes to Me 
 shall not hunger
He who believes in me
 shall not thirst
No one can come to me
Unless My Father draws him.

Chorus
And I will raise him up
And I will raise him up
And I will raise him up
On the last day.

The bread that I give
Is my flesh for the life of the world
And he who eats of this bread
He shall live forever
He shall live forever

Unless you eat of the flesh
Of the Son of Man
And drink of His blood
And drink of His blood
You shall not have life within

I am the Resurrection,
I am the Life
He who believes in Me
Even if he dies
He shall live forever

Yes Lord we believe
That You are the Christ
The Son of God
Who has come 
 into the world."
1584;That's Why I Call Him Lord;;"I was taken from His side
When my Lord bled and died
The earth shook and 
 all of nature's pillars cried.
On that sad and mournful day.
The sun went down and hid away
When by His Blood 
Jehovah God purchased His Bride.

Chorus
That's why I call Him Lord
Lord Jesus Christ
Yes, I call Him Lord Jesus Christ
I'm a new creation, I'm His flesh,
I'm His Spirit and I'm His Bone
And I'll tell the world He's Lord
And we two are one.

Several times I have let Him down
But my slide made His Love more strong
From His side flowed reconciling Love
Such a Love the world don't know
And such a Love it could never show
It took the Dove to bring it down
 from up above.

For a sign just to show the world
 that my gene was celestial
From His side Royal Blood just flowed
Oh, the serpent's head was crushed
Well done, hallelujah to God's Holy One
Who by His Blood has brought me 
 back to God"
1585;Don't Worry;;"I want you to know, that a few years ago
I thought things were going well
But Satan he came in to interrupt my plan
That's when things began to fail
The Lord Jesus told me to keep on living right
Keep walking in the Light
Don't worry, it will be alright.

Chorus
Don't worry when things go wrong
God will keep you if you go on
Keep on living right
Keep walking in the Light
Don't worry, it will be alright.

My health seemed to fail
I wasn't feeling well
But I tried so hard to carry on
I lost my appetite, I couldn't sleep at night
Sometimes I was left all alone
But He told me to keep on living right
Keep walking in the Light
Don't worry, it will be alright.

I want you to know
That Jesus loved me so
No matter what others had in mind
He took me by my hand and said
""Son understand, I will be Yours
 and you'll be mine"",
He told me to keep on living right
Keep walking in the Light
Don't worry, it will be alright."
1586;Resurrection Morning;;"On the resurrection morning
When the dead in Christ shall
We'll have a new body
praise the Lord we'll have a new life
When the saints of God shall gather,
Over on the other side
We'll have a new body
Praise the Lord we'll have a new life.

By and by when the morning comes
When all the saints of God are gathered Home
We will tell the story how we overcome
And we'll understand it better by and by

I wondered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in
But then Jesus came like a stranger in the
 night.
Praise the Lord I saw the Light, 
I saw the Light, I saw the Light.
No more in darkness no more in night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow inside
Praise the Lord, I saw the Light

Some glad morning
When this life is over, I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
 I'll fly away. 
Oh I'll fly away oh glory, I'll fly away
Raptured in the twinkling of an eye,
I'll fly away

In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way, to Canaan's land
I'm on my way, we'll have a new body
Praise the Lord we'll have a new life
Have a new life."
1587;I Have A Friend;;"He's the Joy of my salvation
When I need Him, He's always there
I'm gonna save Him

I'm gonna hold Him anywhere

Chorus
I have a friend so dear to me
His love for me is so kind and free
His name is Jesus Son of God
King of kings and Lord of lords

What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
Oh what a privilege just to carry
Everything to God in prayer

He's my doctor in my sick room
He comforts me 
 when my friends are gone
He helps me bear my every burden
He never leaves me no not alone"
1588;All The Words;;"All the flowers,
are all about tomorrow
Are in the seed today
In the seeds we're sowing

Chorus
All the words you speak
 are little seeds,
When they're planted 
 they will grow.
And you reap
 every seed that you sow.

Our words can justify us,
 or condemn us on that day
So why not say what God 
 says
And sow the seeds
  the right way.

Words of hate can kill, 
Words of love can heal,
Words can make one laugh
And words can make one cry"
1589;I'm Judging Him Faithful;;"You said in your Father's house
Are many mansions
If was not so, 
You would have told me;
So You've gone to prepare a place for me
That where You are,
There I'm also going to be.

Chorus
So I'm judging You faithful
So I'm judging You faithful
Faithful who promised.

When You left these shores
 two thousand years ago.
(taken up in a cloud)
There stood two angels saying
""Man and brethren why stand ye here gazing?
For this same Jesus which is taken up from you
Shall so return in like manner"",
And I know that's true.

You said whatsoever I stand praying
Go away believing
For what-so-ever you ask the Father in My Name
He will give it to you, for my God is forever the same.
You said no gates will ever stand before me
For in Your Name sin will have no dominion over me.
And I believe, yes I believe
That's the way, yes
That's the way it's going to be."
1590;God's Eagles - On The Wings Of A Snow White Dove;F;"I lived in a world of sin and shame
That only caused me grief and pain,
And I tried so hard to be free,
Searching for my true identity,
Didn’t know I came from eternity,
Until God came and revealed it to me.

Chorus
On the wings of a snow-white Dove, 
God sent His pure sweet love, 
On the wings of a snow-white Dove 
To take His eagle home.
On the wings of a snow-white Dove, 
God sent His pure sweet love, 
On the wings of a snow-white Dove 
To take His eagle home.

I knew somehow I was born to fly
Way up in the sky,
But somehow I couldn’t set 
 my wings free;
But since that day I heard His voice
And made Him my heavenly choice,
By His grace I can say
 I’ve been set free.

Now behold what manner of love
The Father hath bestowed upon us,
That we might be called 
 the Sons of God!
Wherever He bids us we will go,
Wherever He leads we will follow,
’Cause who the Son has set free
 is free indeed."
1591;I Am Going To A City;;"I am going to a City
Where the streets of gold are laid
Where the Tree of Life is blooming
And the roses never fade
Here they bloom but for a season
Soon their beauty is decayed
I am longing for a City
Where the roses never fade

Loved ones have gone to be
 with Jesus
Saved by His blood on the cross
Now they're waiting for our coming
And the roses never fade
Life here is but for a season
Soon death takes our joy away
There'll be no more death in heaven
Where the roses never fade"
1592;Let's Be Ready;;"Our prophet brought this end time message
To turn our hearts back to the fathers' faith,
And to loose our lives, from the binging chains
 of sin
So the life of Christ, could dwell within
We were called out to be loyal servants
To be dedicated and sincere
So let us press, towards the mark of Christ,
 of the high calling
And be able proven to get there.

Chorus
And let's be ready for the glorious translation
It will happen in the twinkling of an eye
Let's be ready for the day.
When we will be called away
Then eternity will take the place of time.

Keep on holding to the mighty hand of Jesus
Keep abiding in His presence night and day
Let's keep our eyes on things above
Behold His vision of Love
And be thankful for His mercy and grace

Let's keep striving to achieve our purpose
Keep our faith anchored down in our souls
Have the token on display
In subjection we must stay
That the Holy Spirit take control
Let us wait upon the Lord with patience.
Keep Your Fire burning in our hearts
Let us be courageous and strong
He will guide us all along
For He promised, we will never die.

Let's keep looking for His great appearing
And keep listening for His final call
For the Spirit of The Lord, is preparing to depart
As gross darkness falls upon this world.
As the countdown enters the zero hour
As this journey is about to end
Let us be sure that our lives line up with the Word
For the rapture's just around the bend.

Let's be thankful for His kindness
Let's be thankful for His Love
Let's be thankful for His mercy and grace
His mercy and grace
His mercy and grace."

Now the glory of His gospel
Shines through us wherever we may go
Changing ugly caterpillars
Into beautiful heavenly creatures

As we sweep through those pearly gates

Soon we'll see the light of morning
And the new day it will begin
Soon we'll hear our Father calling
""Come my children enter in""
Then we'll hear the choir of angels
Singing out the victory song
All our troubles then will be ended
And we'll live in heaven above

Soon we'll meet again our loved ones
And we'll take them by the hand
Soon we'll press them to our bosom

And the prettiest songs with the angels we'll be singing

Your sins are under the blood;
It’s good to know you cannot be lost
Under no circumstance,
But when the perils of this life
Befall you everyday;
There’s peace with God,
But most of all you need
The peace of God.

The Father comes and shows you
your standing,
And that all you have ever done
wrong
He doesn’t remember;
But to face your everyday trials you
need something
That will give you settled peace
And cause worrying to cease.

The Father comes and shows you
your standing
And that your sins were placed in the
sea of forgetfulness;
But sight and time being your worst
enemies,
Breed fear and sometimes insecurity."

Then let Jesus come into your heart.
If you desire a new life to begin

Just don't reject Him no more.
Just cast your doubting aside.
And let Jesus come into your heart."

I'm coming up, I'm coming up
Although my burdens
Sometimes press me down
But if I can only keep up pace
I must strive just to run this race
Oh! I'm looking, I'm looking
For my starry crown

This old world, will soon be over

For me to run
But I have to stand before God' throne
All my heartaches will be gone

1612;Who Is Worthy - Rev 5;;"The cry went out, 
""Who is worthy, to open the Book?""
The answer comes back
""No-one 's worthy,""
From the heavens and earth we looked
No apostle, priest, nor king,
Even holy sages couldn't look
But don't weep John,
 we've found one worthy
The Lamb will open the Book.

Chorus
Four and twenty elders, 
 four living creatures
Ten thousand and thousands of angels
Sing blessing and honor, power and glory
They sang, 
""Worthy is the Lamb that was slain""
For the Lion of the tribe of Judah
 has prevailed.
Praise His Name.

John knew all was lost if no-one's worthy
When Adam fell, they lost the Book
It would take the Kinsman Redeemer
To loose the seals and open the mysteries
 that were hidden
Wounded and bleeding came forth the Lamb
 that had been to Calvary
He took the Book from the hand of His Father
And said, ""I've come to set them free""."
1613;We Are So Blessed;C;"We are so blessed

When we're empty You fill us
Till we overflow
When we're hungry You feed us
And cause us to know

We are so blessed
By the things you have done

1614;Eagle's Song;;"I heard a story about an eagle
As I played the tape today
I listened closely, to hear what
Brother Branham had to say
As he began my heart moved in me
I was that eagle in the story
Now you listen too
It could be you also he was talking about.

Chorus
Fly high little eagle
High up in the sky
Way high in the regions
Where only eagles can fly.

One day a man put an eagle's egg
 in the nest of a hen
When he hatched, he tried to be
 like all the rest of them.
He tried to do all the things that they did
But all his trying didn't make him fit
Ooh! he tried to fake it
He couldn't fake it
He was meant to fly.

When his mamma flew right over him,
And she began to scream
There was just that something about it
He began to lift his wings
The cry was what he needed to hear
To give him faith to rise up in the air
No longer in bondage
He had been in
He was free atlast.

I was just like this eagle
Till I heard my father cry
""Come on up my little eaglet,
You were always meant to fly""
So I spread my wings and flew
 right to Him.
His cry brought me out of the differences
The deep is calling
The deep is responding
And it was Love"
1615;All Praise To Him;;"A living sacrifice He came
Into a world of sin
Knowing of a time
That He was born to die

And now we give
 all praise to Him.

Chorus
All praise to Him, The Son of God
He's worthy all praise
All praise to Him, The Son of God
He paid the price for our sins
That was the reason He died
 on the tree.
All praise to Him, the Son of God.
All praise to Him.

Truly he has bestowed
Blessings on us all
But yet we fail to give Him praise.
And then God comes again
And shows His love to men
And once more we realise
It's all praise to Him"

On the wings of a Snow-white dove.

Chorus
Lo! in His mouth
Is an olive leaf
That speaks about redemption
That speaks about His grace
Lo! in His mouth
Is an olive leaf
It speaks about Eternal Life
And fellowship with God

Economic and social 
 pressures are everywhere.
Many have been caught unawares
The hour of temptation, 
Has come upon everyone
But unto us His little Bride
His Voice is saying, ""Shalom""

He said, ""Fear not my child,
All your troubles are over,
Your enermy has been destroyed
Your great enermy has been conquered
Fear none of these things
That shall tear this world apart""

Who are shut up in the Ark."

Trusting in His Holy Word
For now we have a perfect faith
Oh! oh! oh, we can't turn back
We've come this far by faith

Just remember the good things
 He has done
Things that seemed so impossible
We praise Him for the victories
We have won"
1618;Living In The Presence;;"Like a tiny seed in the ground
I lay in darkness
Unaware of the Son behind
 the clouds
But when the Light of God
Shone in my soul I was born again
Free from my sin, free to serve Him

Chorus
The Son shined down in me
His Word is changing me
And making all my darkness flee
He lives in me
Since the day I heard His Voice
And made Him my choice
I'm living in the presence of 
 the Son.

In the secret of this end time hour
the evening light is shinning
Leading us to a resurrection day
But when the shadow of His light
Will fade away
Changed we will be to immortality
 eternally."
1619;His Name Is Jesus;C;"There's One above all other 
 friends to me.
There's One who always 
 understands and cares
There's One who sympathises 
 tenderly.
There's One who always hears
 and answers prayer

Chorus
His Name is Jesus
Wonderful Jesus
His Name is Jesus
And I love Him so
How I adore Him
Bow down before Him
His Name is Jesus
And I love Him so.

In sickness and in health
He's my best friend
In poverty and wealth
He's by my side.
He promised to be with me
 to the end.
In Him I am completely satisfied.

His Name is Jesus - Wonderful Jesus
His Name is Jesus - And I love Him so.
Take my reputation 
Take my dear self relation 
Just give me Jesus
For I love Him so."
1620;Blessed Are You;Bb;"Like a hart, pursued by his evil foe
He knows well to stay near the brook,
Where the waters flow
So panteth my soul
After You, the Living Word
I know well to stay near that river
Where living waters flow

Chorus
Blessed are you, who hunger 
 and thirst after righteousness.
Blessed are you, for you shall
 be filled.
Blessed are you, when man 
 persecute you for my Name's sake.
Blessed are you, Blessed are you
Blessed are you.

Where there is a deep
There is a deep to respond
For unto this end were you born
To be a child of God, a child of I Am
Know that the Great I Am, 
 now dweleth in you.
And soon through you He'll display
He's just as great today
As He was yesterday.

In  the midst of the night,
We saw an amber-coloured Light
The Light of yellowish green
Is Jesus of the scene
Come to lead His elected genes
Beyond the riven veil
On peaceful waters the ship now sails
No more tossed to and fro
By stormy winds that blow
He has anchored our soul."
1621;The Heavens Do Rule;E;"Oh the depth of the knowledge
And the wisdom of the Lord!
His judgements are unsearchable,
And His ways past finding out;
Who hath directed His Spirit?
And whose counsel did He take?
For by Him and through Him
Are all things on earth made.

Chorus
And we know that all things work
together for our good,
The footsteps of the righteous are
ordered by the Lord;
Even though things don’t work out
The way we think they should,
Yet we know in all things,
That the heavens surely rule.

Which of us by taking thought could
add to ourselves?
Why do we yet so many times resist
His will?
We’ve got to realize salvation is
wholly of the Lord;
Just stand still and consider
All the wondrous works of God.

There is nothing that happens without
 a real intent,
Our experiences were ordained,
Our trials have been sent
That we might manifest the purpose
Unto which we have been called,
So in perfect confidence
We can submit to Him our all."
1622;More Than Conquerors;D;"The hour of shaking is now at hand
When many builders would realize
They have built on sinking sand.
For the stone that the builders refused
They have rejected, the Revelation of
the Son of Man.
But unto you He's been a treasure,
And an anchor to your soul,
All the evils of this world
We’ll overcome.

Chorus
For more than conquerors we are, 
Through the power of Jesus’ Name. 
Priests and Kings He has made us 
And forever we shall reign. 
For more than conquerors we are, 
Through the power of Jesus’ Name. 
Priests and Kings He has made us 
And forever we shall reign.

Many pressures came from outside
and within,
And temptations did rise to take a look
Unto the other side;
But by the grace of God we resisted sin
And the devils were surprised,
We knew by the Word of the Lord
We were tested and tried;
But unto you who look above
Through the window of perfect love,
God has sent to us His sign
On the wings of a Dove.

As the new ministry becomes reality,
Now men will see with the eye
The works of God expressed through
His little Bride,
Every knee must bow, every tongue confess,
Men’s folly be made manifest,
The foolish man won’t be able to stand;
But unto the wise who understands
Great exploits are now at hand,
For Michael’s feet are on the sea and
on the land."
1623;Come What May;;"He didn’t say that it was going to be easy;
Every promise my Lord has made
We’ve got to fight to claim.
For as many as He called,
He gave the power to overcome;
And every devil that stands before us
Must be on the run!
So why should I ever think it strange
When fiery trials should come my way?
For He said that if I do suffer for His Name,
With Him I shall reign.

Chorus
Come what may, 
with Your Word I will stay,
Come what may,
I’ll press through anyway;
Come what may, 
Lord have Your way.

I’ll consider Him
Who for the joy that was set before Him,
The cross He endured;
And that same life now dwelleth within me
Victory I’m assured.
For He did say, He’ll never leave me
nor forsake me,
And as a seed of Abraham
I’ll possess the gates of my enemies!
Why should I ever think it strange
When fiery trials should come my way?
For He said that if I do suffer for His Name
With Him I shall reign.

As I journey along,
May Lord I ever be, courageous and strong;
For inch by inch I’ll possess the land
For I’m a journeyman,
By striving lawfully,
Knowing Thou savourest reverence
and humility;
Let the fullness of that meal offering
Be displayed in me!
I should never ever think it strange
When fiery trials should come my way,
For You said that if I do suffer for Your Name,
With You I shall reign.

When I am down on the ground,
May I press through like a lily
In spite of the muck all around;
Rejoicing in the glory wherein You
have clothed me.
When I am up in the air
And the strong winds blow,
May I ever know that You are there;
But if I be like a wounded dove,
May I press through with Your
message of Love.
For I no longer ever think it strange
When fiery trials should come my way;
For I know that if I do suffer for Your Name
Lord, with You I shall reign."
1624;I Want To Rise Up;D;"As I strive daily Lord to see Your
Word perfected,
Help me be so deeply sincere from
within;
For I know this is my time for
consecration,
And I must lay aside my every weight
and sin.

Chorus
So I can rise up on the wings of faith
And soar the Heavens wide.
So I can live in heavenly places,
Far beyond the clouds and skies.
So I can see like the eagles,
The things God sees from up above,
Just to follow in the way of the Dove.

Seeing Lord, You’ve given me a path
to follow,
And You showed me just what I was
called unto,
Lord, prepare me to be always in Your
service,
A true service unto You I want to do."
1625;Come Let Us Stand;;"Who are we children,
And what were we born to be?
Not just mortal creatures of time
But reflectors of eternity.
Why were we placed here
Amidst temptation sore?
It’s to develop our character,
And prove we’re worthy of the Cross.

Chorus
Come let us stand together
on God’s Word.
Come let us stand together
on God’s Word.

We belong to a body, to a unit
so unique,
Every member is important,
From the head down to the feet.
Everyone is affected
When one goes out of place,
So let’s take our places faithfully,
Let’s strive to keep the faith.

We’ve got to recognize
The deposit of the Word,
That God has placed within us
To face this evil world;
The skills that we’ve been blessed with,
And the natural ability,
Are like seeds and when planted
Will bring forth abundantly.

Bridge
For we were made overcomers
Through Jesus Christ;
And this is the victory,
That overcomes the world - even our
faith."
1626;Let The Rain Come Down;C;"We are living in these last days,
In a harassing and a thirsty age.
God sent Elijah His prophet again
That He might come and bring the
rain.

Chorus
Let the rain come down,
Let the thunder roll,
Filling me up, let me overflow
Till I can take no more;
Filling me up, let me overflow
Till I can take no more.

When you are a seed of God,
You’ve got to be planted in the Word
to die;
Your body might decay here in the
earth,
But it will spring to life with eternal
growth.

In these last days we are living in,
We know that the life which is in us
will spring again,
As small as a mustard seed, saints,
it will grow;
As big and wide with branches flowing
on the other side!

I want the former and the latter rain to
reign in you;
I want the former and the latter rain to
reign in me;
I want the former and the latter rain to
reign in you;
I want the former and the latter rain to
reign in me.

I want the rain to come and give me
Faith,
I want the rain to come and give me
Virtue,
Let the rain come and give me
Knowledge,
I want the rain to give me
Temperance,
Let the rain come and give me
Patience,

I want the rain to give me
Godliness,
Let the rain come and give me
Brotherly Kindness,
And Charity that the Super-anointing
power could be seen in me."
1627;I Saw Satan Fall;Eb;"You were the one who weakened the nations,
Brought this world in so much sin;
Praise God your power has been broken,
When our Lord, our mighty conqueror
 entered in,
Freed us from sin;
Now I look unto redemption,
The abstract title deed has come;
Showing me that way unto perfection,
For this wicked world of sin I’ll overcome.
I’ll sit with my Father in His throne,
I’ll reign with Him one thousand years,
Where there’s no sickness, or sadness;
Only joy, no more fears, no more tears.

Chorus
I saw Satan fall like lightning,
Coming down from the sky;
How art thou fallen son of the morning,
Who thought you could exalt yourself
so high?

You were the one upon those horses;
White and red, black and pale,
Praise God your power has been broken,
Since those Seven Seals have been unveiled,
You have failed;
Now I look unto redemption,
The abstract title deed has come
Showing me that way unto perfection,
For this wicked world of sin I’ll overcome;
I’ll sit with my Father in His throne,
I’ll reign with Him one thousand years,
Where there’s no sickness, or sadness;
Only joy, no more fears, no more tears."
1628;The Seven Names;F;"Lord I want to take the time,
Just to praise Your Holy Name,
’Cause You’ve been, been so good
to me;
So from the rising of the sun,
To the going down of the same,
Lord Your Name alone is worthy to be
praised.

Chorus
Jehovah Nissi, the Lord our banner;
Jehovah Rapha, the Lord our healer;
Jehovah Shalom, the Lord our peace;
Jehovah Shammah, the Lord is present;
Jehovah Raah, the Lord our shepherd;
Jehovah Tsidkenu, the Lord our righteousness;
Jehovah Shalom, the Lord our peace;
Jehovah Jireh, He provideth all our needs.

You are the great I AM that I AM,
The God that was, is, and is to come,
Prophet, Priest and King,
Eagle, Lamb and Lion,
Son of Man, Son of God and Son of
David.

You are the Rose of Sharon,
You’re the Lily of the valley,
You’re the Bright and Morning Star,
That’s who You are;
The Mighty Conqueror that’s been
unconquered by traditions,
The Lord God Jehovah is His name."
1629;He's Been Faithful;F;"In my moments of fears
Through many pains, many tears
There's a God who was faithful to me
When my strength was all gone
When my heart had no song
Even then, God was faithful to me.
Every word He has promised is true
What I thought was impossible
I've seen God do.

Chorus
He's been faithful, faithful to me.
His love and mercy I see
Though in my heart,
 I have questioned
Even failed to believe
Yet He's been faithful,
Faithful to me.

When my heart looked away
The many times I could not pray
Still my God, He was faithful to me
The days I have spent so selfishly
Reaching out for what pleased me
Even then, God was faithful to me
Every time I come back to Him
He's waiting with open arms
And I see once again."
1630;Never Forsaken;A;"Oh, I know you may be weary,
And at times it can get rough,
You may not have all you want
But you always have enough;
And when it seems you’re at the end,
Just remember what I say,
I’ve never seen the righteous
forsaken
Nor his seed begging for bread.

Chorus
I’ve never seen God’s people
With a need that He could not meet,
I know that He cares for His own
And His promises He’ll keep.

And you don’t know what to pray,
You’ve done all you know you could
And it seems there’s just no way;
And when your darkest hour would
come,
Just remember what I say,
I’ve never seen the righteous
forsaken
Nor his seed begging for bread.

So just hold on a little longer,
The answer’s soon to come,
The endless waiting almost over,
The victory’s almost won,
And when again you feel this joy
Just remember what I say;
I’ve never seen the righteous
forsaken
Nor his seed begging for bread."
1631;Empty Me;F;"Oh Lord, I’ve heard Your Word that
has called me,
And now I can’t turn away;
I’m compelled by the truth that I
hear,
Just to walk with You my Lord,
This is my prayer.

Chorus
Empty me, dear Lord,
Of all my self and pride;
Empty me, dear Lord,
Remove secret sins inside;
Empty me, Oh, my loving Lord,
Until I’m just like a little child,
So Your will could be done in my
life.

And I know that in myself I am not
worthy Lord,
Of the place that You’ve prepared for
me;
But I love You, and I really want to
serve You,
So each day of my life
I will live for You.

Sometimes from within,
Lord, how I groan and cry,
How I hunger and I thirst for Thee;
But I would not be satisfied,
Until I be filled with You,
Empty me, so that I can be filled with
You.

Empty me, dear Lord of unbelief
inside,
Lord let me never pretend,
Remove fears and doubts within;
Empty me, oh my loving God,
Until I’m just like a little child,
So Your will could be done in my
life."
1632;Outlaw;;"Some said He was an outlaw
He'd roam across the land
With an unschooled band of 
 ruffians.
And a few old fisherman

No one knew just where
 He came from.
Or exactly what He had done
But they thought it must
 be something bad
That kept Him on the run.

Some say He was a poet
Who'd stand upon the hill
And His voice could calm 
 an angry crowd.
And made the waves stand still.

That He spoke in many parables
That few could understand
And people came from 
 miles around.
Just to listen to this Man

Some say a politician
Who spoke of being free
He was followed by the masses.
On the shores of Galilee.

He spoke out against corruption
And He bowed to no decree
They feared His strength
 and power
So they nailed Him to the tree."
1633;He'll Never Let Go;F;"Oh there's a hand that covers
 the mountains
And that furnished all the galaxies
And that same hand that holds
 the world in space
Is the same hand that's holding me.

Chorus
And He'll never let go of my hand
Till I stand in heaven's fair land
Till I'm safe forever more
on that happy golden shore
No, He'll never let go of my hand

He's been faithful when cold wind
 were blowing.
And He's been true when storms 
 have assailed
But His Holy Love that amazes me
Is that He loves me, even when 
 I fail."
1634;Let There Be Fellowship;D;"Let there be fellowship, true
fellowship,
In the homes of the people,
In the house of the Lord,
Family and church alike,
May we all be knitted so tight;
That we’ll serve one another,
As Ye first served us.

Grant us relationship,
True spiritual relationship,
That we might walk together
In the love of the Lord.
Not just ""How do you do?""
But ""I really love you so"".
That all men will know we are
The disciples of Christ.

Bridge
We confess our need of healing,
Lord, so often we’ve been dealing
With our strife and many problems
In our own way;
So we’re in a broken up state,
Got to find a way to prostrate,
Help us oh Lord.

Bridge
For we love each other, don’t we?
And we need each other, don’t we?
And we are a family, Aren’t we
Under our Lord?
So Father, You would want to free us,
And would want to really see us,
In one accord."
1635;I've Recognised The Voice;;"I will turn my back to sin
Let Your Love pull me in
Knowing wisdom begins with fear
Turn my trembling to fervor
As I learn daily to serve
For I have recognised The Voice
That draws me near

I have recognised the Voice
I have understood the call
I have seen the beauty of the
 One I fear.
It's He who calls my name.
And His mercy I will claim
I have recognised the voice
 that draws me near.

I draw near only through grace
I can now look on His face
Holy, Holy is the One who meets 
 me here
I know only that I must now by
 faith, begin to trust.
For I've recognised the Voice
That draws me near."
1636;I'm Undeserving;C;"I don't deserve to come to You Lord
With my troubles and selfish pleas
I know I have failed You in so many ways
But never have You failed
To meet all my needs
I'm the least in Your Kingdom, I know
But Lord, don't forsake me now
All of Your mercies I could never afford
I'm undeserving of Your Love,
But Love me Lord

For nobody here really knows me
And no one here understands my fears
When I'm in trouble and I'm all alone
Lord only You can dry my tears
O, if You should leave me
Then where could I go
To find rest for my weary soul?
And because I'm so unworthy
I love You even though
I'm undeserving of Your Love
But Love me Lord

I don't deserve the blood that You shed
When You died on the cross in my stead
And to think that each drop of blood 
 that fell from Your brow
Would reach down a drop a time to 
 cleanse  my soul now.
I don't deserve the place that You 
 prepared for my life, when this life is over
But take my love forever
I'm undeserving of Your Love
But Love me Lord"

The Capstone came shouting ‘Grace,
Grace, Grace!’
To cap off the Pyramid of our lives.
Here we stand in God’s image and
likeness,
We are flesh of His flesh and bone of
His bone,
There’s never been a people like this.

The Dove of Agape love flew into our
hearts
Bringing comfort, peace, joy and love;
This mortal shall put on immortality,
This corruptible shall be incorruptible
for all eternity."
1638;Right Where I Belong;C;"Who am I anyway?
I’m just a little lump of clay,
And if my strength is to no avail,
Yet it doesn’t mean that I have failed,
For when I’m weak Lord, You’re made
strong,
So there is nothing going wrong,
You’ve brought me to that place,
Right where I belong.

Chorus
Right where I belong,
Your grace and Your love through the
years
Have brought me along,
Who am I, who am I?
That You’ve taken me from the pit,
To heavenly places with You I sit,
You’ve brought me to that place,
Right where I belong.

Who am I? Lord consider me,
I’m just a little lump of vanity,
Like a flower that blooms and fades
away,
Its mortal life withers every day.
But Lord, You’ve given me eternal life:
You’ve even called me Your virtuous
wife;
You’ve brought me to a place,
Right where I belong.

Who am I? Lord let me die,
Just let Your Name be glorified,
At Your service Lord, here I stand,
Your wish, oh Lord is my command;
For You died to set me free,
And You did it so willingly,
To bring me to this place,
Right where I belong."
1639;Travailing In Birth;F;"Oh God, You’re my God, early will I
seek Thee,
My soul thirsteth for Thee;
My flesh longeth for Thee in a dry
and thirsty land
Where no water is, but I know I’ll
find Thee;
For all of my life
There’s been this deep and inward hunger
To see my Saviour,
And if I don’t see You, Lord,
I just don’t know what I will do,
For You’re the only one to see me through.

Chorus
Oh, I’m travailing in birth
And pain to be delivered,
Travailing in birth and pain to be
delivered;
Oh, I’m travailing in birth
And pain to be delivered,
To manifest the living Christ,
Oh, I’m travailing in birth
And pain to be delivered.

To see Thy power and Thy glory,
So as I have seen Thee in the sanctuary;
Thy loving-kindness is better than life,
My lips shall praise Thee all of my life;
You’ve put this deep within me
So that I will thirst for Thee,
You’ve placed this desire within my soul;
My soul followeth hard after Thee,
Thy right hand upholdeth me.

There appeared a great wonder in Heaven,
A woman clothed with the sun
Standing on the moon,
And upon her head a crown of twelve stars,
And before her stood a dragon;
But when the enemy comes in like a flood
My God will always lift a standard,
For no weapon formed against me
shall ever prosper,
And every tongue that rises
I will condemn forever."
1640;I've Come A Long Way;D;"I've come a long way
I've had fears and doubts
But in Your mind Lord
You knew I could live with them
So You chose at this time to wave before me
The thing You knew would make me
Give up myself and my thoughts
I could never have worked by my own works
But of Faith that it might be by Grace
To the end that the promise might
 be sure to all the seed
Unto us, of the Faith of Abraham

Chorus
And I'm looking for the promise
Of my new body, as my earth quakes
All my sin is shaken off
The Holy fire from above
Puts sin out of existence
For holiness can not dwell
In sinful earth.

But while I'm here living in this world
I live by faith of the Son of God
 revealed in me
To believe His Word and claim what's my own
By promise it was freely given to me
 and when it seems that there is no hope
Believe in hope, and consider not the things
 which my eyes see
But look into the Word of God
That shall not pass away
And it's righteousness, which is by faith.

I'm living in the day,
When my desert is blooming like a rose
I'm living in the day
When my thorns are unfolding to leaves again
True fellowship is being restored
It's the promise of the Lord.
I'm looking now for the promise of my change
I'm looking now for the promise of my body
I'm looking now for the promise of my change."
1641;Look For Me;D;"When you finally make 
your entrance to that city,
Oh, jasper walls and that

and its splendour,
Remember there’s just one request
I beg of you.

Look for me,
For I will be there too.
I realize when you arrive,
There’ll be so much to view;
After you’ve been there
Ten thousand years,
A million, maybe two,
Look for me;
For I will be there too.

As you go down your list of firsts,
There’s no question,
You’ll want to see your loved ones
waiting there for you;
And when you feel you’ve shared your
story with the last one
That wants to hear you tell just how
you’ve made it through.

Look for me,
I'll like to hear it too.
I realize when you arrive,
There’ll be so much to view;
After you’ve been there
Ten thousand years,
A million, maybe two,
Look for me;
For I will be there too.

going on,
So it might seem to the natural mind;
But don’t you know my friend,
Great things happen in silence;
Have you ever heard the sun rise?
Have you ever seen the flower grow?
And in this half an hour silence,
There are people becoming the Word.

Chorus
Many are changing from glory unto glory,  
Hearts are being raptured up into glory; 
People walking holy unto the Lord, 
It won’t be long and we’ll  be gone.
Many are changing from glory unto glory,  
Hearts are being raptured up into glory; 
People walking holy unto the Lord, 
It won’t be long and we’ll  be gone.

God’s great mystery’s been unfolding
In such a silent way,
He hid it from the wise and prudent,
Revealed it to babes;
Why don’t you look in and see
God in simplicity?
Christ is unveiled before our eyes,
Can’t you see?

Let’s search our lives my brothers,
This is a treacherous hour;
Search your lives my sisters,
It’s not easy to be left back in this
hour."
1644;God's Angels Are Around;;"In a world full of troubles,
We travel along, God is our Father
We are on our way Home
If forces of evil, ever close in on you
Jesus has promised
This is what He will do

Chorus
God's angels are around you
To keep you from harm
To guide and direct you
Till you are safe from all harm
God's angels are around you
You are never alone
And you'll be protected
By the father above.

God's prophet Elijah,
In the Bible we are told,
Approached by an army,
Just stood there so bold
For he heard God whisper,
Fear not my son, Just look up
 to heaven,
see what I have done."
1645;Angels Step Aside;G;"What a celebration on that day,
It can’t be very far away;
Heaven’s Bridegroom has descended,
The ransomed bride of God ascends;
Heaven’s bell will sweetly ring,
Choir of angels start to sing,
Pick up your trumpet Michael and
blow.

Chorus
Here comes the bride to be ever at
His side,
Oh, what a spotless bride!
Oh, what a glorious sight!
Here come the chosen ones,
Here come the ransomed ones,
Angels step aside,
For here comes the bride;
Angels step aside,
For here comes the bride.

Some from every nation will be there,
Wearing spotless robes
So bright and fair.
All of Heaven will behold,
The bride is marching down the
streets of gold,
Getting ready now to go,
The very hour no one seems to know,
Pick up your trumpet Michael and
blow."
1646;Shephered Of My Soul;;"Be it in a quiet pasture
Or upon a gentle stream
The Shepherd of my soul
 is by my side
Should I face a mighty mountain
Or a valley dark and dim
The Shepherd of my life will
 be my guide.

Chorus
Shepherd of my soul
I give You full control
Wherever You may lead
I will follow
I have made a choice
To listen to Your Voice
Wherever You may lead
I will go."
1647;Maranatha;F;"Men’s heart are failing for fear,
Divers earthquakes everywhere,
It’s a sign my friend, we are living in
the end time.
The generation that sees the budding
of the fig tree
Shall be the last one in the end time.

Chorus
Maranatha, even now, come Lord
Jesus
And take your waiting bride away, for
we living in the end time;
Take your waiting bride away for we
are living in the end time.

The scientists call the signs UFOs,
But they simply do not know
They are investigation angels coming
down in the end time;
Modern events that you and I see
Are made clear by vindicated
prophecy,
It’s a sign, my friend, that we are living
in the end time.

A true prophet this generation has
denied,
But His message was received by
God’s little bride,
Hear His voice my friend,
We are living in the end time;
One like unto to the Son of Man in a
cloud showed His final sign,
Hear His voice, my friend, we are
living in the end time.

The Spirit and the bride say come,
For the day of mercy is almost done,
Hear His voice, my friend, we are
living in the end time;
He that is filthy will be filthy still,
So, my friend, be surrendered unto
God’s will,
Hear His voice, my friend,
We are living in the end time."
1648;Jesus Is All I Have;D;"From a world, a world of sin and
shame,
Jesus brought me out
And into the light I came;
Showed me truth so I’ll not be
deceived,
His word I believe,
Now I live to lift His name.

Chorus
For Jesus is all,
He’s all that I have to live for,
And even though His way seem hard
sometimes
The end’s eternal life,
So I live for Jesus Christ,
So I live for Jesus Christ.

I hold close the opportunity
That’s been given me
To serve the Lord in my day;
Tell me what could be a greater
privilege than to serve God in this
age,
To walk in His provided way.

We can’t live in a world of fantasy,
Of worldly thoughts and dreams,
They will fade away so fast;
But this truth, this word that sets us
free, is the only reality,
It is the only thing that always shall
last."
1649;Blessed Be The Lord - Father In Heaven;C;"Father in heaven how we love You,
We lift Your name above the earth,
May Your kingdom be established in
our praises
And Your people declare
Your mighty Word.

Chorus
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
Who was and is and is to come.
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
Who reigns forever more."
1650;Can't You Hear;C;"A new day has dawned
And I know not what it brings,
But somehow I feel I’m almost home;
Not turning back to yesterday
But pressing towards my calling in
Christ,
I can hear, yes I can hear my
theophany calling me.

Chorus
And can’t you hear your theophany
calling you?
It’s a sign, it’s almost home time,
And I’m just waiting for my promised
body change,
For soon I know, we’ll be with Him on
high.

The whole earth is groaning and
travailing in pain,
But we as the bride have been
glorified in Him;
And saints, even though we may
suffer,
Stand and gird your loins,
For your perfection it draweth near.

Bridge
My God knows overtime is drawing
near,
And very soon the dead in Christ shall
rise again;
There’ll be no more sickness,
No more crying over there,
But for now, Christian Soldier,
Just keep on pressing."
1651;Look Away To Jesus;G;"Born to be a supersign in this great
and final age,
When the whole world is falling apart
again,
The prudent minds search for
solutions,
Which we know they cannot find,
We know the answers lie
Beyond this dimension of time.

Chorus
I’m looking away to Jesus,
He’s the only way, sweet Jesus,
I’m looking away,
I’m looking away to Him.

Born to live in a super sense,
Far beyond what man can perceive.
The Word of God is what our hearts
would only believe;
Looking to the unseen,
We see a brighter and better world,
So on the promises of God,
Is what we’d anchor our souls.

Born to overcome this wicked world
That Satan has deceived,
The promises of God is what we’d
only believe;
His Word has power to transform
By the renewing of your mind;
To see the judgements of God,
We’re at the end of time.

Born to be a super race,
Abraham’s royal seed.
Upon the bread of life is what we’d
always feed;
Looking for a city whose maker and
builder is God,
We know that soon we’ll reign
With Jesus Christ our Lord."
1652;Stature Of A Perfect Man;;"As the time is drawing near
That our lord will soon appear
May we check our lives
Keep them pure and spotless white,
Daily striving to be more and more
 just like Thee
Getting rid of the small things we find
Those little foxes that spoil the vine
Lord we're asking, we're praying
Help us become that stature of 
 a perfect man.

We need faith dear Lord
It comes by hearing Thy Word
Next is virtue, strength and power
To give to others in this evil hour
Knowledge to judge the right from wrong
Temperance to handle our temper 
 and tongue.
Patience to wait, till God's own time,
Godliness like You, we wanna be found
Brotherly kindness Lord help us apply it all
Then comes Your perfect Love

Love suffereth long,
Love protects when our brother is wrong
Love is not easily provoked
When evil is abound in this world
Love is patient and kind to all,
Love reaches out when someone falls.
Love covers a multitude of sin
And Love will make us this battle win
Lord we're asking we're praying
Help us become the stature
 of a perfect man."
1653;Before He Came;;"Before He came,
My life was hopeless
So full of grief and it seems that,
No peace I could find
Till I met the Master
Turned my life over to Him
And He saved me, forgave me
My sorrow He bore

If you had known me
 before I knew Him
You'd understand why I love Him
If you had known me
Before I knew Him,
You'd understand my love.

I hadn't much to offer
Just heartaches and fears
Just a life that was filled with despair,
For my rags, He gave me riches
For my fears, He gave me peace
For my old life, He gave me
 a blessed relief."
1655;I Cannot Fail The Lord;;"The Lord of my life, 
He has never failed
On my own I could 
 never succeed.
This one I can't know
There's so much that I owe
And I cannot, cannot fail the Lord.

Chorus
I cannot fail the Lord
I cannot fail the Lord
He has never failed me yet
Every promise my Jesus has kept
And I cannot fail the Lord.

And things, when they are down
And His Name I'll call
In my past I did not trust God
I trusted in myself
But now I know, I have His help
And I cannot fail the Lord."
1656;In The Presence;;"In and out of situation
A tug of war I feel
Holding on I struggle
For the answers that I need
And then I come in His presence
All my questions become clear
And for that sacred moment
No doubt can interfere

Chorus
In the presence, of Jehovah
God Almighty, Prince of Peace
Troubles vanish, hearts are mended
In the presence, of the King.

Through His Love the Lord provide
A place for us to rest
A place to find the answers
In the hour of distress.
Now there's never really reason
For you to give up in despair
Just let away and breath His Name
He will surely meet you there."
1657;Hold Fast To The Right;;"Kneel down by the side
 of your mother my boy,
I have only a moment alone
But wait till I give you this parting
 device
It is all that I have to bestow

Chorus
Hold fast to the right
Hold fast to the right
Wherever your footsteps may go
And forsake not the way of salvation
 my boy
there you learn from your mother
 at home

I gave you to God in your cradle
 my boy
And it's only the best that I know
And as long as His mercies permit
 me to live.
I will never cease praying for you.

You will find in your treasure a Bible
 my boy,
Its the book of all others, the best
It will teach you to live and prepare 
 you to die
And will lead to the gates of the 
 blessed."
1658;He Didn't Come To Stay;;"Sickness must be present
For healing to take place
Lives must be broken
So they can be restored
We must stop looking at our
 hard times.
Like they were dead end roads
But avenues to prove that He is Lord.

Chorus
He didn't come to stay
He came to pass
The Lord will move the mountain
 if you'll ask.
The trials that we see today
Won't last long
He didn't come to stay
He came to pass

If I should live by sight
I would be beaten down
Because I can't see past
These walls of circumstances
But faith will be my substance
And my hope is the Lord
He will turn my sorrow into dance
He will turn my sorrow into dance"
1659;You Are The Calm;;"The battle rages on
It seems my strength is almost gone
The trials overwhelming
Till I feel I can't go on
The deep within this heart of mine
Is a peace that gives me rest
Knowing You are in control
I can overcome the test

Chorus
And I know, You're 
 the calm within the storm.
You're the only peace we have
 when it seems our life is gone
Though all hope may be lost
Lay we the hearts beneath the cross
Dear Lord its good to know
Deep within this soul
You're the calm within the storm.

Discouragements hits hard
The devil tries to drop my gun
Constantly worrying with
 the battles of the mind
With it softly whisper a prayer
I claim the victory
Knowing in Your tender arms
The devil has no claim on me."
1660;Treat Him Like A King;F;"When we give the Lord our hearts
He deserves every part
But very often we hold back 
 some things
We should have given from the start.
But I just wanna be His Bride
There is nothing to hide
Every corner of my life l give
To let Him rule and let Him live

Chorus
I'm gonna treat Him like a King
Make Him Lord of everything
All the honour I can bring
I'm gonna treat Him like a King

Now I pray the world will see
That He means everything to me
I'll spend the rest of my life I live
Treating Him like Royalty
He is free to rule and reign
And my heart is His domain
While the world is praising other things
I'm gonna crown Him King of kings.

All the honour I can bring
He's the only song I'm singing
O let the anthems ring
I'm gonna treat Him like a King"
1661;Quiet Time;;"Quiet time, quiet 
Quiet time, quiet time
It's so precious to me
Oh Lord, so precious to me
That's where You tell me Lord,
My God, secret things
Secret things to tell me, oh yes
Oh Lord as You want me to be

Oh quiet time, quiet time
Quiet, quiet time
I feel closer to My God
I feel closer to Thee
In His closeness, in His closeness
There's no doubt, there's no doubt
No fear, no pain
No fear, no pain - Yes My Lord.

Oh quiet time, quiet time
Quiet, quiet time.
It's Jesus who touched my soul
That's all it is, that's right
Neither day nor night - Day nor night
It's just the same - Just the same
Just the same
That's where He tells me His mind
He tells me, He tells me"
1662;There He Is;;"I take a look down through the ages
Through the corridors of time
And as I look I see my God
Standing by His bride
Through torture, death, good times (amen)
He was there right in the midst
And with every trial you are going through
You can conquer, He's right beside you.
There He Is.

Chorus
There He Is, standing right besides
His little Bride
Meeting all her needs she has inside
And when this world and all her friends
 reject her, He will still be there.
Faithful to His Word She has to bear
And whatever she may do,
Through all Her trials
He will see Her through.

And I, always love to see
How a husband treats His wife
How He cares for her
And treats her well
No matter what the price
Oh! but going far beyond that love
God cares for His own
So if you think you are all by yourself
Just remember you are not standing
 all alone."
1663;Charity O Charity;;"Holy Spirit has been seen
In the churches all around
Sweet Holy Spirit heavenly dove
I know He never will fail you.

Chorus
Charity O Charity
Throw Your robe around me
Take me in the inner veil
Where the glories never fail

Though the battle has
 been raging on
And the storms are dashing high
We shall have the 
 tremendous victory
Only in the Love Divine"
1664;Jesus We Enthrone;;"Jesus we enthrone You
We proclaim You are King
Standing here in the midst of us
We raise You up with our praise
And as we worship build a throne x3
Come Lord Jesus and take Your place

Chorus
Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing
Power and Majesty praise to Your King
Mountains bow down and the seas will
 roar, at the sound of Your Name
I sing for joy at the works of Your hand
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise
I have in You.

My Jesus, my Saviour
Lord there is none like You
All of my breath, I want to praise
The wonders of Your Mighty Love
My comfort, my Shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every race, all that I have
Never cease to worship You"
1665;The Anchor Holds;;"I have journeyed
Through the long dark night
Out in the open sea
By faith alone sight unknown
And yet His eyes 
Were watching over me.

Chorus
The anchor holds
Though the ship's been battered
The anchor holds
Though the sails are torn
I have fallen on my knees
As I face life's raging seas
But the anchor holds
In spite of the storm

I've had visions
And I've had dreams
I've even held them in my hand
But I never knew
They could slip right through
Like they were only grains
 of sand.

Now I have been young
But I am older now
And there has been beauty
These eyes have seen
But it was in the night
I faced the storm of my life
Oh, that's where God proved
His love to me.

I have fallen on my knees
As I face life's raging seas
But the anchor holds
In spite of the storm."

divine revelation
Above justification (higher)
Above sanctification (higher)

soul for rapturing condition)
Great is the Lord
Who has restored the cloud on
Sunset mountain brought me
perfect faith(2x)"
1676;Where The Eagles Dare;A;"We have been born in an eagle age
By an eagle prophet’s message
To manifest the living word for our
day we have been given wings to fly
way up in the sky
Where no other bird can fly
To live in a heavenly atmosphere
To fly where only eagles dare

Chorus
Let’s fly so high
Where the world of God is a living
reality
To soar so high, true eagles in the
sky
Set your wings let’s fly
Where eagles dare

We have been gathered by the
shout
A message that called us out
From this world of fear and doubt
And have been given eyes to see
All the mysteries are being revealed
Our lives are fulfilling prophecy
To see our position in God’s word
To fly where only eagles could

We are not called to be earthbound
Amidst the chipmunks on the
ground
Neither be living up and down
But quickened, changed, lifted up
upon the mountain top
Setting in the cleft of the rock
Gathered where the carcass is
The place where eagles live"
1677;The Centre Of My Life;;"It seems I have a million things to do
Everything its placed in front of You
But Lord it's not my desire
To see it go that way
So I rearrange priorities
Seeking for Your will
Down on my knees
Giving You the first place
Knowing its Your strength
I can't replace

Chorus
You are the centre
The centre of my life
You're the reason why
I can live more abundantly
Let there be nothing
Nothing placed before You
So I can see You in plain view
I want to do everything
 through Christ
The centre, centre of my life.

Whenever I begin my day with prayer
You have never failed to meet me there
And though the other things of life
Just seem to work out right
My eyes are fixed on You and You alone
Lord please and come rule 
 upon this throne.
So that in this life of mine
I can feel your presence all the time."
1678;Almost Home - And We'll Be Home;;"I love Jesus yes I do
And He loves me I know it's true
And one day, I'll look upon His face
 I know.
But I'll wait until the day
When My Lord calls me away
For just a little while
 and we'll be home

Chorus
Almost home, we're almost home
For the time is drawing near
My heavenly light
It shall come down, change my body
And I'll not be found
For it's just a little while
And we'll be home

Sometimes it seems so hard to wait
But His promise won't be late
For He always keeps His Word
 this I know
So I'll keep pressing on
I believe it wont be long
For it's just a little while
And we'll be home"
1679;Rejoice All The While;;"I came down in the valley
as low as you could be
And I know how to settle that
With someone just like me
It's hard to understand
the things that we go through
But God has told us in His Word
Exactly what to do.

Chorus
Rejoice in the trouble
Rejoice in the trials,
No matter what you're going through
Be praising all the while
God will make you happy
So you can wear a smile
For it will be worth it all
When you come through the trial

How shall I prove my love
To One who loves me so
Who came from the glory world
To Calvary He did go
The proof of my love will be
Believing in His Word
And with joy amidst the trials
Obeying what I've heard"
1680;I've Learned To Trust Him;;"He gave me joy
When I didn't have no joy at all
he gave me peace
When I had no peace at all
And in each disappointment
He was there to see me through
And said if you will trust me
That's all you have to do

Chorus
I've learned to trust Him
I've learned to trust Him
In every step I take
He walks with me
On mountains high above
In valleys so deep and low
Wherever that I may go
I've learned to trust Him

He gave me love
That I had never known before
When no one wanted me
And they kicked me from their doors
It made me sad, but soon I was glad
To know that One loved me
And that Same One loved me
Even eternally"
1681;I Long To Go Home;;"I'd ride in the range
I see God who don't change
In the cactus, the flowers, the sky,
And I'm telling you why
I'm riding so high
I've a home in that sweet by and by.

Chorus
Home I long to go home
As I ride this great gospel train
It'll be worth it all
To hear that great call
Come home now
Your journey is over.

While riding this range
Sometimes things seem strange
When the storm clouds 
Are gathering around
Satan tries to tell me
There's no home you will see
But I know it's waiting for me."
1682;We Are Gathered Here;;"We're gathered here

Angels hovering all around

I will sing to the Lord
Lifting my hands

We come to You in one accord
Holy, holy Lamb of glory
Hallelujah to the Lamb."
1683;Amen - Lord I Lift Mine Eyes;;"Lord I will lift mine eyes to the hills
Knowing my help is coming from You

In times of the storm.

You are the source of my strength
You are the strength of my life
I lift my hands in total praise to You

Amen, amen, amen, amen"
1684;The Lord Is My Shepherd;;"The Lord is my Shepherd 
I'll not want
He makes down to lie 
In pastures green
He leadeth me the quite
waters by

My soul He doth restore again
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness
Even for His own Name's sake 

Yea, though I walk in death's 
dark vale
Yet will I fear no evil for thou
art with me
And thy rod and staff comfort me still

My table thou hast furnished
In the presence of my foes
My head thou dost with oil annoint
And my cup overflows  

Goodness and mercy all my life 
Shall surely follow me
And in God's house forevermore
My dwelling place shall be"

1710;Just Once More Lord;;"Spiritually strained, morally broken
with his eyes plucked out 
Here stands a man with all of his statue
but with no power in his life.
Raised up by God and given power
to put to flight, the armies of the enemy
But gave away all of his secrets
was now bound up in captivity.
In the book of his rememberance
were all the great victories he had won
realising his present condition 
From deep down inside his cry began

Chorus
Just once more Lord}x2
so we can feel your spirit moving once again
Just once more Lord  
Just once more Lord}x2
so we can see your power moving once again
Just once more Lord 

Repented of all mistakes and failures
praying in his heart, Lord, let me die'
Not considering what it would cost 
Should God hear and would answer his sincere cry.
For he could see his locks had grown up
and he was thinking, is there a possibility
of the power of God coming back.
He began to cry more earnestly.

Inagurated at pentecost 
Signs and wonders manifestations of the name
But then at the council of Nacea
The early church had its locks shaved
With the promise of restoration 
we have seen God's church rise in power
through its stage 
until God sent to us a prophet
And we seen the fulness of God's life on display.
But its been so long since the eyes have gone out
And there is a new crop that is coming forth.
For greater works and dynamic power to be displayed
may we as Samson of old cry, 
Just once more"

How could you look
In His tear stained eyes
Knowing it's you He's thinking of
Could you tell Him you're not ready.
To give Him your life
Could you tell Him you 
 don't really want His Love

If Jesus Himself were standing here
face full of glory and eyes full of tears
And He held out His arms
Nail prints in His hands
Is there any way you could say
 no to this Man

Jesus is here
With His arms open wide
You can see Him with your heart
If you quit looking with your eyes
He's left it out to you
He's done all that He can
Is there any way you could say

In valleys of shadows

Guided to yonder bright land
Never neglected I'm surely,
 protected, I'm led by the Master's hand

Led by the hand that was nailed
 to the old rugged cross

For I'm led by the Master's hand

Darkness may gather
And storms may be raging but Jesus
will care for me
He will be near me to comfort and

Where saints of all ages shall stand,
Gone is my sorrow no fear of tomorrow

And bring them to the Lord
Pick up your broken pieces 
Trust in his holy word

And make your life complete

I cannot dare not walk alone

A thousand snares beset my feet 
A thousand foes are lurking nigh 
Still thou the raging of the sea
Oh master let me walk with thee

To make the mountain disappear

Chorus
Speak to the mountain 
You'll not triumph over me
Be thou removed from here to yonder
Disappear into the sea
Speak to the mountain 
Speak with authority
And the mountain must move
And you will claim victory

In the midst of the battle
When the foe is gaining ground
Just look up and see
The mighty hand of God reaching down
Speak God's Name and Satan trembles
Speak God's Word and watch him flee
Once again our God delivers
The mountain crumbles at our feet"

Changed in the twinkling of an eye

1765;Guilty Of Love;Bb;"Chorus
Guilty of love in the first degree
So he had to go to Calvary
Where he shed his last drop
Of blood  for me
And the Jury found him guilty 
Of love in the first degree

""Order in the court,
Would you bring the prisoner forward please?"" 
And what sir is your name?, and he said Jesus Of Nazareth
You are accused of healing on the sabbath day
And many other things,the elders did say
They say your disciples plucked corn on the 
sabbath day and did eat
And that you yourself,sat with sinners at meat
And what have you to say,but he kept silent that day
But wait,let's see what the witnesses have to say 

My name is Bathemeus and I was blind, could not
see the light of day, oh but I see today because of him
And another came, and another and there was another 
and he said, I was a leper I was  one of the ten 
and I've come back this final time just to glorify him
And on and on they came that day, each fo him had
 kind of words to say.
But then the crowd began to cry, crucify him! crucify him!
give us Barabas! this man here he must die!
And so they took him away to a place that's called Calvary
and  nailed him to the cross between two thieves
For the jury had surely found him guilty, guilty of love in 
the first degree....."

And when I think of what He has done
And where, that He has brought me from
I've got so much to thank Him for

Well sometimes, along life's way I knell 
 and I stop.
And say thank you Lord for all you have 
 done for me
Oh but some day when I reach the 
 heaven's shore
Lord please just let me kneel once more
I've got so much to thank Him for.

I wanna thank Him, for letting me see
 this last day
End Time Mystery, and I know that

For the Seals they have been revealed
And now that body change we could feel
I've got so much to thank Him for

That He drew me in

You can live a life that the people
 may say there's a man that's nice

For without this love in you
It willl be all in vain"

No road blocks along the way
I'm using my Bible for road map

They crossed the Red sea of destruction
For Jesus was there to see them through"

To dawn the robe of an earthly man &
Feel the pain of flesh and bone

That leads to Calvary
But those blood red stains

of a wide raging river 
Trusting that i'd get across
I've mde my way the valleys and deserts
Belive me, i'd never get lost

Knowing i'd have the strength for the climb
It's through every trial
Each test and temptation
There's one thing is sure every time

Chorus 
Over and over, again and again

To stand and survive
To come through alive
When it sure looked like I couldn't win
Jesus is with me 
So i'll claim the victory
Over and over again

If you ask me why?
I have no hesitation
If God does what He said He will do
I'd simply say every battle has taught me
There is nothing He wont help me through 
So why should I dwell on the hardships
and struggles
When I look just beyond them I see
The way this will end is in great celebration
and deep in my heart I believe"

 live in a dream
You are and eagle, you are born to fly.

Chorus
I am flying where no ther birds can fly
In the supernatural atmosphere 
 high in the sky.
Seeing things I have never seen
She has taken me places I.ve never been
and the higher I go is the more I see.
I'm living in the reality
I'm an eagle, I was born free.

Higher and higher I rise each day
I'm rising to a perfect faith
Rising on a mighty rushing wind
Rising above the rhythm of the music
Rising above the clapping of hands
Rising above the joy of the saints

The devil tried his best to catch and 
 deceive me.
But then God sent His Word to me
He delivered me.
And He's given me a law inside
To fly until I soar through heaven's 
 doors."

How he left His home above
To die on Calvary
To save someone like me

As He stood in Pilate's hall
He never said a word at all
Wasn't that Love,
Wasn't that Love
He heard the mob hail crucify
Oh but he knew that He came to die
Wasn't that Love,
Wasn't that Love

As He laid there in the tomb
He did what He came to do.

 felt the Saviour's leading
I was drawn to what I could not understand
But for the cause of Christ I have spent 
 my days believing that what He'd have me be
Is what I am
As I've come to see the weaker side of me
I realised His grace is what I'll need
When sin demanded justice for my soul

Mercy said no.  I'm not gonna let you go
I'm not gonna let you slip away
You don't have to be afraid
Mercy said no.  Sin will never take control
Life and death stood face to face
As darkness tried to steal my heart  away
Thank you Jesus.  Mercy said no

For God so loved the world
That He sent His Son to save us
From the cross He built a bridge,
To set us free
Oh but deep  within our hearts
There is still a war that rages
And makes His sacrifice so hard see
As midnight fell on crucifixion day
The light of hope seemed so far away
As evil tried to stop redemption flow

And now when heaven looks at me
It's through the blood of Jesus
Reminding me of one day long ago"

 successors
Like diamonds in my hands
But those trophies could not
 equal
To the grace by which I stand

In Christ alone, I place my trust
And find my glory in the power 
 of the cross
In every victory, let it be said of
 me
My source of strength, my
 source of hope is Christ alone

In Christ alone do I glory
For only by His grace
 I am redeemed 
For only his tender mercy
Could reach beyond my
 weakness to my need

And now I seek no greater
 honour
Than just to know Him more
And to count my gains but
 losses
To the glory of my Lord

In Christ alone, I place my trust

In every victory, let it be said of

Chorus
Your grace and mercy 
 brought me through, 
I'm living this moment 
 because of You, 
I want to thank You and
 praise You too, 
Your grace and mercy

Justice demanded
 that I should die, 
But grace and mercy said
 oh no oh no oh no, 
We've already paid
 the price 
I once was blind but thank
 God I can see 
It was because grace and
 mercy came along 
And rescued me"

Tears will never stain

No wreaths of death
on my mansion's door
Tear drops aren't welcome
beyond the gates of glory
Because our hearts
will never break anymore

I questioned the lose
of our loved ones,
Their graves seemed
so final and so cold,
Oh, but will meet again
were death has no victory!
In a land were we'II never grow old

I've never met one man

Never looked into eyes

But I know a land,
were grief is a total stranger,
And songs of joy 
on the other shore
We are to sing."

As we struggle,
 through this world and its strife

Believing He'll see me to the end
I see Jesus,praise His name
i see Jesus

So now I'll stand strong ,cause He's there
I won't be afraid ,for He'll always be there
I'll pray for strength to carry on
Even though with this mortal hand
I can't touch Him
I'll keep holding on by faith
For if I look to Him
Then everything will be alright

BRIDGE

Made a little lower than the angels
That by the grace of God
Should taste death for every man

Believing He'll see me to the end
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Isee Jesus"
1839;Galatians 6 vs 7;;"Do not be deceived,
God is not mocked.
What you sow is what you reap.
Everything that you do has repurcussions,
It will come back to you,
 one way or the other.
You cannot escape
 the concequences of your action.
What you do will come back to you .
Watch the way you live your life,
Because you'll reap what you sow."
1840;I'm Free;;"When I think of Jesus 
This man who died for me
took my sins away
What made Him give his life 
It was the meaning of amazing grace
I just couldn't see, the bloody lamb
that was slain for me 
I could not believe 
The suffering he bore 
took my place on the tree 

Despised and rejected 
It pleased the Father
to give His Son for my life
Smitten and afflicted
I am now a prisoner of Christ
I've never known such love
To save me from the wrath 
He covered me with his blood
Amazing grace I see justified I stand

Chorus
Free from the bondage chains of sin
Christ now dwells within 
I'm free He was the perfect sacrifice 
The Lamb gave me His life.

1843;Ressurection morning;;"They placed him in a dark tomb
At the ending of the day
They watched the soldiers roll the stone
And they sadly walked away
but suddenly within their broken hearts 
It was the words they heard him say,
'Don't weep for me i'll live again,
on the ressurection morning.'

Chorus
Ressurection morning  arose 
to set the captives free
ressurection morning
Jesus won the victory
At breaking of the dawn
They went running to the tomb
For he was gone 
Mary cried and said 
'My saviour lives' on ressurection morning

He walked along besides them 
still they did not believe
then he sat with them
and broke the bread
And their eyes where made to see
as they watched him taken from their side
Behold two men robed in white
said like you've seen,He'll come again
on ressurection morning"
1844;The Value of a day;;"We wake up in the morning
and start out our day
Before you know the time has gone
It has slipped the away 
Because we got too busy 
And did not read and pray
We forgot the value of the day

Chorus
The value of a day 
Is worth so much to think
And if you take your time for God 
You'll live eternally
Just keep on pressing on
Toward the upward way
And realise the value of the day

24 hours are found within a day
So there is really no excuse
If you don't read and pray
But you'll pay for your neglection
If you fail to go God's way
So don't forget the value of a day"
1845;Will Soon Be Done;;"Some of these days I'm going home
Where no sorrows ever come,

(Troubles and trials)
Safe from Heartaches, pain and care,
We shall all that glory share,
(And I'm gonna)
Sit down beside my Jesus,
(Lord, I'm gonna)
Sit down and rest a little while.

Chorus:
(We'll soon be done)
We'll soon be done with troubles and trials,
(Troubles and trials. In that home)
Yes, in that home on the other side,
(On the other side, and I'm gonna)
Shake glad hands with the elders,
(Lord, and)
Tell my kindred good morning,
(Then I'm gonna)
Sit down beside my Jesus,
(Lord, I'm)
Gonna sit down and rest a little while.

I shall behold his blessed face,
I shall feel his matchless grace,
(We'll soon be done)
We'll soon be done with troubles and trials;
(Troubles and trials)
O what peace and joy sublime
In that home of love divine,
(And I'm gonna)
Sit down beside my Jesus,
(Lord, I'm gonna)
Sit down and rest a little while."
1846;Champion Of Love;;"Ladies and gentlemen 
May I have your attention 
I would like to introduce to you
In this corner of the good and the right
Stands a champion robed in white
His height exceeds the heaven 
His weight outweights the world
His rich reaches everywhere
His age is evermore

CHORUS
He's higher than the highest
Greater than the greatest
No one could ever take his crown away
He's more mighty than the mightiest
He reigns from above
He's the all time undisputed
Undefeated champion of love

He left his hometown 
To enter this arena
To raise his hands in victory 
For you and me 
But you see it was the
angry crowd they cried ''crucify him''
He who wore that crown and they
watched my champion going down
But I will never count him out because 
I'm a witness of that day he rose
to proclaim''chamopion of love''"
1848;Preach The Word;Bb;"Paul was weary on his joourney
His body frail and weak.
The apostle knew the end was near,
As he dipped his pen in ink.
He wrote, Timothy, my son

Carry on what I've begun
But most of all i pray.

Chorus
Preach the word, preach the cross
Preach redemption to a lost and dying world
Lift your voice ,Unashamed , of this Gospel
of his Name..
Until of have heard
Preach the word.

Paul and Timothy are gone,
But the letter still remains,
And the mission that was written down,
Calls out to us to day.
Lift the name of jesus higher,
Until the whole world knows,
The story of amazing grace,
We are messangers of hope!

Preach the word, preach the cross
Preach redemption to a lost and dying world
Lift your voice ,Unashamed , of this Gospel
of his Name..
Until of have heard
preach the word.
(preach the word ,preach the word, preach the word.)"
1849;His Voice Makes A Diffrence;;"When I need Him, 
I know where to find him,
In my place of prayer
His Spirit hovers near,
Oh His voice gently gives me my direction,
And I'll follow that voice that i hear.

Chorus
His voice makes the difference,
When He speaks,
 He relieves my troubled mind,
It's the only voice I hear,
 that makes the difference,
And I'll follow one day at a time.

Oh His voice is a strong and mighty tower,
Tearing down,every strong hold in my life,
He is the master of the wind,
 and the sea that rages,
When He speaks all my darkness turns to light.

I have heard other voices speaking to me,
To decieve and to lead me astray,
Oh but my shephered's voice,
 is diffrent from all others,
I'm his sheep,
 and i know my shephered's way"
1850;Gone;;"Mary came unto the tomb of Jesus
The stone was moved,
He had gone away
The angel said, fear not,
I know whom seek yee
For He has risen and this she had Him say

Chorus
Gone, the stone is rolled back
Gone, the tomb is empty
Gone, to sit at the father's side   
Gone, over death triumphant,
Gone, sin is defeated,
Gone and He lives 
forever more

Oh! come with me and see this risen saviour
Who can still turn the dark of death today
He can calm the storms of doubt and part
the oceans,
And He can still roll your heavy stone away!"
1851;I Lift My Hands;;"I lift my hands (I lift my hands)
To the coming King (To the coming King)

To you I sing 
For You're the One 
Who reigns within my heart

Chorus
And I will serve no foreign God
Or any other treasure 
You are my heart's desire
Spirit without measure
Unto your name
I will bring my sacrifice"
1852;This Is The Promise;B;"I never said that I would 
give you silver or gold
Or that you would never
 feel the fire or shiver in the cold
But I did say you'd never
 walk through this world alone
And I did say don't make
 this world your home

I never said that fear wouldn't
 find you in the night
Or that loneliness was something 
you'd never have to fight
But I did say I'll be right there by your side
And I did say I'll always help you fight

'Cause you know I made a promise
 that I intend to keep
My Grace will be sufficient in 
every time of need
My Love will be the anchor 
that you can hold on to
This is the promise, 
This is the promise I've made to you

I never said that friends would
 never turn their backs on you
Or that the world around you, 
wouldn't see you as a fool
But I did say like me you'll surely be despised
And I did say my ways confound the wise

I didn't say that you'll never taste
 the bitter kiss of death
Or have to walk through chilly Jordan
 to enter into rest
But I did say; I'd be waiting 
right on the other side
And I did say I'll dry every tear you cried

'Cause you know I made a a promise 
That I've prepared a place
And someday sooner than you think,
 you'll see me face to face
And you will sing with the Angels
 and a countless mutitude
This is the promise, 
This is the promise, I've made to you

So just keep on walking, 
Don't turn to the left or right
And in the midst of darkness, 
Let this be your light
That hell can't separate us,
And you're gonna make it through
This is the promise. This is the promise
I've made to you"
1853;Just A Closer Walk - I Need More Of You;C;"I am weak but Thou

Just a closer walk with 
    Thee,

That's the way it's got to be
More of you
Till there's no room left in me
All those wasted hours
and minutes
They're yours now, from the
start to the finish
I need more of you, In me

I need more of you
Fill me with nothing less
I need more of you
Give me your love than

I could never get enough
Of your grace, your peace
your warmth and your love 
I need more of you
I need more of you
I've got to have more of you, In me"

 You may think you’ve gone too far,

That can wash away your deepest sin
There is hope for you my friend
Jesus died and rose again
So that you could know the Joy of sins forgiven.

The Blood that cleanses from all sin,
Will never lose its power

True happiness was like a dream,
But he made my dream come true.

As we stand here willing.
To eat from the table of Life
Drink from the fountain

In a land filled with honey
Where trhe rivers all running
Very soon now will I

We've got no treasures here below
There is a place where they are stored

In this world we are pilgrims and strangers
But there's a place where we belong
Soon we leave satan's Eden

But we seek the one to come
We desire that heavenly country

The thorns were on his head

And while he was on the Cross,
You and I were on his mind."

Walking in heavenly peace,
And I know if they could,
Talk to me now,
Here's what they'd say to me.

Wish you where here,
Its such a beutiful place,
Wish you where here,
Nothing but clear sunny days,
It never raiins and noone complains,
We haven't seen a tear,

Wish you where here.

Strolling through the fields of heaven,

That you miss me too,
And till then,
You'll be thinking of me."

That I found in you,

The weaknesses I see in me,
Will be stripped away,
By the power of Your love

Chorus
Hold me close,
Let your love surround me
Bring me near,
Draw me to Your side
And as I wait,
I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You,

In the power of Your love

1877;You're All I Want;;"Have you really thought
How wonderful is our Lord
Jesus Christ
He redeemed us by his
precious blood
We are his purchase price
For I know what I was
And you know where he took
you from
We were sinners bound in
chains
Lord we didn’t know we had
Your name
We thank You Lord Jesus
We thank You Lord

We hide it in our hearts
We will not let the enemy
steal it away
You’re all I want Heavenly
Father(2x)

And now the Word speaks of
Boaz
And the redemption of Ruth
We’re the reality of that mystery
That is revealed in you and me
Now we know who we are
And what we were raised up for
Oh Lord, you cover me
Lord Jesus you cover me

You are the great Kinsman
Redeemer

In whose sight we have
found grace
We know You will not rest
Until You finish the work that
You began in us
We are Your bride, Jesus"
1878;Travel Like A Thought;;"This world is getting old 
My desire to stay here has grown old 
And the signs I see are telling me 
That I'm not welcome anymore

Chorus
I'm gonna reach out to the unseen
And let the deep waters cover me 
I'm living this world 
With the token that was bought 
For I was born to travel like a thought 

I live in a secret place 
Where I will always behold his face 
And the God I see 
Is telling me 
""Welcome to eternity""

Heaven's arms are reaching out to me 
 drawing me 
I've embraced my destiny 
I was born to travel like a thought"
1879;The Rapture;;"In the wilderness of Judea
Came John The Baptist preaching
Repentance to the people
With a message so strong yet
Others scoffed at him 
Called him a fanatic
But the Lord had spoke
For sure Christ came among them
When Peter and them saw Jesus
Shine on Mount Transfiguration
They asked Him, ""Musn't Elias first come?""
Jesus answered, ""He's already come
and you knew it not."" 

CHORUS
Help me Lord not to miss the rapture
In this end time
I believe I'm one of those ordained
To receive it
Help me to believe your word 
Through and though and all the way
The way the desciples missed 
John The Baptist as Elijah
I know the rapture will be the same way
So help me Lord not to miss
The rature, In this end time

Everything will move
Just as common as it can be
For the message of the rapture is just
But a myth to the world
People wil start missing 
And no one will notice
Yet the Lord spoke for sure
""Like a thief in the night""
The rapture is acoming
But I know I believe
The truth in Your word,
The revealing of the Seals 
Is a revelation of my redemption"
1880;Wish You Where Here;;"I can just see them 
Strolling through the fields of heaven

Chorus
Wish you where here
It's such a beautiful place
Wish you where here
Nothing but clear sunny days
It never rains no one complains
We haven't seen a tear 
Oh Oh we having a great time
Wish you where here

You'd let me know
You doing fine, it doesn't hurt anymore
Things couldn't be better
Heaven is worth waiting for
That you miss me too and till then
You'll be thinking of me
And I know if you could talk to me now

Strolling through the fields of heaven

1883;Widow With Nothing;;"There was nothing left
Just a little bit of oil
  that was all she had
The situation seemed hopeless
Life seemed empty the fire
  that she had was gone
and she could nolonger
  sustain her family
She was widow wth nothing
 a widow with nothing
That was her story

With creditors approaching
  in her most desperate time of need
She stood all alone
 no friends, no family
They had their charges
 you can not pay your debt
your children become a ransom
They shall be taken
She cried Oh Lord I have nothing
I'm a widow with nothing
That was her story

Go thus saith the Lord 
God had already told me
Your troubles will be gone 
The story of your life will be
 different from now on
Bring every jar you can find
God will transform your life
The little oil that you have
will be multiplied

Now the house that was empty
now has everything
The widow who was weeping can
rejoice and sing
Where there was nothing today
you can have it all 
Step up by faith and see God
Multiply your oil

Now your fire is burning 
shine your light each day
You've touched the herm of his garment
as he passed your way
Those who saw  you suffer
in the hands of debt
Now see the blessings of the Lord

Even now 
Right Now

Your children will never be slaves
and you will never be in debt anymore"

I long so much to
feel the warmth,
That others seem to know
Should I never feel a thing

Help me now to receive

1886;Still Tied To My Absolute;;"Oh mighty man of valour,
You faced your enemy,
And with the sword you've
 slaughtered,
You had sweet victory
 but it gets bitter, 
When you're tried in the fire,
And it gets hard sometimes,
But pleasing to the soul,

Yet if you choose to leave your 
 place,
Who will stand instead,
For this cause were you chosen,
To see that devil dead 
 so keep fighting, 
Fighting with all the faith,
Keep looking towards the vision,
For the hour now is late.

Chorus 
So I'll put on the armour of God,
I'll put on the shield of faith,
Trusting in the sword of the spirit,
Praying with sincerity and truth,
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
But principalities and powers,
And rulers of darkness,
Yet here I stand in truth, 
Still tied to my absolute,
Oh-h I am, still tied to my
 absolute.

I've read it in the scriptures,
 Joshua 5:14,
God came down as Lord of Hosts,
Israel was defended and positioned, 
David slew the lion,
He looked at his experiences,
 and David smote Goliath,

Oh and I am of that pedigree,
Why should I cry and fear,
I'll speak God's word with Revelation,
I'll not surrender till I walk upon,
The ashes of that wicked one,
Till I stand face to face,
With the one who kept me
 by His grace."

I don't know how
I don't know why
I cannot explain
The love of God for my soul
But down inside of me 
When I hear the Word
My heart says Amen
I say Amen

He has said I will be perfect
With the virtues of Jesus Christ
 Himself, But I look around I see
So much imperfection
Shown to me by the devil
My enemy, Trying to get me sad
 and depressed,
But I stand right up on my two feet
Look at Him straight in the eyes
And I say...

He Has said I will be raptured
To fly away in the sky
And discover the seventh dimension
But I can still feel the force of gravity
Trying to pull me down to this earth
And get me stuck in this realm
But I stand right upon my two feet
Raise my hand challenging gravity
And I say..."

1893;Message Of The Wounded Dove;;"From the outer regions of the lost
God has brought us back
Her gates are the gates of hell
And many enter therein
Then at last we heard a great
blast
The Thunders uttering
This time they spoke clearly
The mystery of the Seventh Seal
And here we are in the secondfold
of a three-fold mystery
Part being spoken by the
Son of man
But the other in you and me

Chorus
The message of a wounded
dove went home
Now it’s come back again
In the power of the Word
Speaking resurrection
Speaking rapturing faith
Full redemption
From a fallen state

With the power that will
judge the earth
We are lifted higher
Higher and higher until we all
come into that Seventh peak
And from there we’ll change
dimensions
Cross into that other land
Where we’ll meet friends and
loved ones
And those who’ve already gone

A window now is opened
And the light is shining through
Celestial light from a celestial
world
Shining into our souls
The dove and the raven are
loosed
Two powers in the earth
One feeding on the flesh of
disobedient men
But the dove in you and me
And for this purpose He's
descended
A full cycle of time's about ended
And here we are in this reality
While Noah was a coded mystery"
1894;This Is My Prayer;;"History is repeating
But it’s much greater now
For a greater than Ruth is uniting

 harvest appear
But to come into full union with
Him, This is my prayer

CHORUS
This is my prayer
This is my cry
I want more of You
No matter the price
Total separation, Lord
Not my will but Thine
Take me up those seven steps
Till in Your image I stand
Take me up those seven steps
Till in Your image I stand

Thresh the chaff around my life
So I’ll be a pure grain
With no hidden sin deep within
To hinder You from coming in
All I want is You my Lord
So please empty me I pray
Because I know the more I
empty out
Is the more that You can fill

CHORUS

1895;Freedom;;"MONOLOGUE
I didn’t see Him walk up
that lonely hill.
Neither His bloody footprints,
that marked the path to His
suffering.
As the nails pierced His
hands and feet,
The veil was rent in two.
He saw the vision,
This blood-bought church
He saw me, he saw you.
Now we are loosed from all
our bondage.
Our shackles are gone.
Death, you still have no sting.
I can still hear His blood cry,
Freedom! Freedom!
Freedom! Freedom!

CHORUS
The blood still cries freedom
From bondage and sin
You don’t have to worry at
the foot of the cross
He wrote our names
Sealed with the blood of the
spotless Lamb
Hold on to God’s unchanging
hand
The blood still cries freedom
Look and live

I have heard but now I see
What the blood can do for
you and me
It has quickened our souls,
Made us whole
We have sweet victory
The Seven Seals are opened
(The Son is risen)
That’s good news from the tomb
A Seven Thunders
message, for rapturing faith
By blood we’ll make it through

Some have fallen in battle
Some led astray
But there are some wounded
soldiers
That need healing today
Nothing is impossible
These dry bones can live
The blood will restore
That’s thus saith the Lord
Oh glory to God.

Hallelujah, let freedom reign,
Emancipation is here
Shout the sword of the Lord
The battle is won

1896;I Feel Like Praising Him;;"When I wake up in the morning
And think of the great things
God has done for me,
In my heart there’s such rejoicing
To think that a new day has
dawned on me;
For the glorious mysteries in
God’s Word,
That He has allowed me to share:
It’s only an indication of His
great love, and how much He
cares.

CHORUS
I feel like p-r-a-I-s-I-n-g Him
P-r-a-I-s-e Him
I feel like p-r-a-I-s-I-n-g Him
P-r-a-I-s-e Him

Like to Abraham, He came down
In this day unto me.
Showing me things that were
and things that are, and
things, things that are to be.
What has been hidden from
the eyes of the wise and the
prudent,
He has revealed unto His own;
A message of preparation, to
take us to our eternal home.

When I think that I’m one in a
million
Chosen by God to stand in
this evil day,
It fills my heart with love for
the Heavenly Dove who has
led me
In God’s provided way.
I, who was dead in sins and
trespasses, so wretched, so
wretched and so vile,
It took His Amazing Grace, to
lift me to a place that He now
calls me,
Calls me His Bride.

When I see all hell extending
her borders to swallow up
humanity, I thank the One with
the keys of death and hell,
Who has opened the prison
door for me.
He has changed my course
from the regions of the lost,
that realm of insanity,
By anointing my eyes with a
Heavenly vision
To behold and live eternally"
1897;Pay The Price;;"Talk about heaven, we sing
about theophanies

Lord how we long for our
new bodies
And there’s a price I must pay
The cost is neither riches
nor gold
All I have is my life that I
want you to mold

CHORUS
I give my life, I’ll pay the price
Just to be close to you, Lord
let me die
Full surrender, laying it all on
the altar
Just to be more like you
I’ll pay that price

Sweet Holy Spirit come now
and fill me
And take away anything
That you know would hinder me
Though many times I’m
weak in my body
And I suffer so much pain
All I want is to be completely
sold out to Him

from my inheritance
And the blessing the Lord
has promised
I looked at my lying vanities
and said
I’m going to walk into my victory

CHORUS
The dove flew into my heart
I know that He did
He has led me through the
storms
I firmly believe
The Lord has raised me up
so high
To believe what He has done
for me
I’m an eagle to soar above
the troubled waters
He has fluttered His wings in
my heart
The dove flew into my heart I
firmly believe
The dove flew into my heart I
know that He did

I may be troubled, confused
and shattered
I may be scarred but I’ll
never give up
He has promised deliverance
from all my bondage
He wouldn’t deny what He
has promised
Jesus has provided all my
needs
Whenever I call on His name"
1900;Strengthen My Hands;;"CHORUS
Strengthen my hands for war
I want to be an overcomer
Strengthen my hands for war
I want to fulfill this word with
power

For though two hundred million
is gathered against me
In this I’ll be confident
If God before me tell me who
could be against me
For they are more with us
than they with them

For there remaineth much
land yet to be possess
Many promises to be fulfill
Can’t let circumstances or
conditions get us down
For we must fulfill his will

CHORUS
For the mark of this age is
perfection
And to miss that mark saints is sin
For Alpha must become Omega
The word made flesh again

For we know that walls will
be built in troublous times
In a time of scoffers and mockers
But we are determined that the
House of God will live again

1901;Speckled Dove;;"I’ve considered the leper in
the day of his cleansing
All his hope was in two turtle
doves
The thing that held him
captive
For most of his life
Will finally be utterly
destroyed
And while she’s fluttering her
wings in the evening time
Crying Holy, Holy unto the
Lord
It will surely bring full
deliverance
And set him free

CHORUS
Sprinkle me speckled dove
Flying Holy, Holy, Holy
Sprinkle me speckled dove
With your precious holy
blood
And while you’re flying on
the eighth day
With the blood of your mate
It’s the only hope for a leper
For his cleansing in that day

Jesus Christ when he came
to earth
Was led to Calvary
He was crucified and his
blood put on the Bride
He was the perfect sacrifice
that was slain for our sins
So we could be free from the
power of in-dwelling sin
And when he hung in the
midst of heaven and earth
Spoiling principalities and
powers
He conquered worlds both
seen and unseen
When he cried “It is finished.”"
1902;My Faith Is Zeroed;;"CHORUS
My faith is zeroed to the change
I'm not just talking about
being born again
But I'm looking to the unseen
That's where I have seen my
Lord’s appearing,
The sleeping saints they are
just waiting,
They are waiting on us to
catch the Lord's thoughts to
draw them out of the earth

God, He made Abraham a promise
Out of thee I'll make a great nation
He had no seed to bring the
promise
But by faith he did believe
And by covenant God sealed
that promise
Abraham knew the time will
come When his body will be
changed
He'll be young again
So he waited at the tent door.

The apostles they just waited
They waited for that blessed
hope They seen the grace
that's been given
Unto us in this age
For in their time they seen
His appearing
And He gave them the Holy
Ghost Now at His second coming
His power He's giving to
raise them out of the earth.

And to His bride He's now
unveiled Now she sees Him
face to face,
He has descended in the clouds
Just as He said He would
return And now you see Him
He's in the pulpit
He is revealing all the secret
things He's giving rapturing
grace to quicken your faith
So your theophany would
pick you up."
1903;Now Is The Time;;"From a world of unbelief
You separated me
To walk in a world of perfect faith
I’m washed in your blood
Now clothed in your
righteousness
Standing as your witness in

And though all hell is against me
You promise they’ll be under
my feet
And wherever I may go
I must let the whole world know
You’re not dead
But alive in me

Chorus
For now’s the time to rise up
Now is the time to stand and
declare
His name to a dying world
And now’s time to shine forth
In the glory of the Lord
revealed in you.

You will shine forth like stars
in this end time
You’ll fulfill all that my prophet
said
But your self will must die
That in you I’ll be glorify
That all men will know
Its not you
But its Christ

1905;Live In Your Inheritance;;"Going home, going home,
We’re going home
Going back to God
From a life of sin and bondage
Taskmasters held me bound
I’ve been living underprivileged
Constructing Satan’s Eden
Then an angel from God
came to me with the word
The mystery of who I really am
Saying you came from God
You go back to God
Come and live in your inheritance

CHORUS
Every place that your feet
tread upon
That I give to thee

be moved
Thus thine eyes shall see

have heard

Any man who strives for the
mastery
Great hardness he must endure
We must press with all that is in us
We must cry out Lord just
once more

We were chosen to endure
To receive the crown of
righteousness god’s promise

To despise the shame endure,

1908;Unworthy;;"I was a sinner, a lost soul
I longed to be free
I didn’t know that God had already
Done a work for me
Then He found me, cleansed
and filled me
I am so amazed, that He just
simply loved me

CHORUS
Unworthy, I’m so unworthy
Of such love and mercy
The price You paid on Calvary
Who am I that He should die for
me
This wretched man, that I am
He sacrificed Himself to set me
free

I didn’t see His nail scarred hands
As He was stripped and in pain
But on the Cross, not once did
He think about His shame
As His Blood flowed from that
Tree
All He thought about was
you and me
Isn’t that love, tell me, isn’t that
love

He went up, but soon, He’ll
come again
Back for you and me
This was Calvary’s mystery
Praise the Lamb that was slain
He went up but soon He’ll
come again
Back for you and me
To take the trip to our theophanies

Unworthy, unworthy
Of such love and mercy
The price He paid on Calvary
You showed me who I am
That You should die for me

1909;Though We Are Tested;;"We walk by faith and not by sight
Our. eyes look to the unseen

For He has promised
That we will reign with him
But the pathway to glory is
through suffering
So count it all joy when you
fall in divers temptations
For it’s only to bring you to
that perfect place

CHORUS
Though we are tested and
we are tried
Yet in the midst of it all
We can have peace of mind
For the trying of our faith
worketh patience
For in my lowest valley He
restoreth my soul
He gives me strength to
keep pressing on

Sometimes we pray oh Lord
please take our lives
We just can’t go on we don’t
know what to do
But in that hour we found a
juniper tree
Where the Angel comes to
strengthen for the journey ahead
For in our weakness His
strength is made perfect
And His Grace is sufficient for us"
1910;I'm Looking Ahead;;"CHORUS

glorious city
Where I'll shake the hands of
those who've gone before me
I can still feel the same tender
hand that's carrying me
Will lead me home so Lord
I'm looking ahead

Living in a world of insanity
We're surrounded by the
dead they are all asleep
But under the Easter seal
thank God we're quickened
and awakened
Now the master is here the
son has risen
He's no longer the hidden
Messiah but he has appeared
Now to the promise of a second
coming I'm looking ahead

So many among us are
hurting
They're wounded in the
battle Lord they are dying
Brothers take each others
hand Sisters do the same
thing too
Lift each other in prayer we
will make it through
And though skin worms may
destroy this body
I've got another one waiting
for me
So Lord fill my soul with your
Holy Ghost
Cleanse me and make me
whole.

1912;My Prayer;Bb;"Monologue
If my people who are called
by my name
Would humble themselves
and pray and seek my face
and turn from their wicked
ways, then will I hear from
heaven and I will heal their
land.

In prayer and supplication I
pour my heart out to you
Sometimes the tears they fall
both day and night
Our hands are worn from
service, our dusty feet climb
rocky pathways
And all we long for is a touch
from the master’s hand
But I see the finish line, it’s
just a few steps away
So I’ll bear my cross with
thanksgiving and praise
For I’m feeling that strange
call from God, saying come
home my child
Heal your people, heal the
land

CHORUS
Heal your people, heal the
land
There’s still balm here in
Jerusalem
My soul is longing for sweet
rest
Heal your people, heal the
land.

Our Father, our Saviour, our
good Shepherd {Bishop of
my soul}
You’ve brought me this far
how could I be lost
Your glory fills the heavens,
it testifies of my redemption
Our sins and shame you
nailed them to the cross
But I see the wounded
soldiers and many who’ve
fallen away
Lord we won’t let them die
but for deliverance we’ll pray
For your arms are open wide
you’re saying come home
my child
Heal your people, heal the
land

Monologue
So like Hannah Lord we cry
to you, open the barren
wombs
Everything we have need of I
know you are more than able
and willing to do
Like Sampson Lord we cry
just once more, just once
more Lord
I must see life signs in this
body
Healing is here, deliverance
is here, I know the Holy
Ghost is here
To restore all that was eaten
House of hell give way,
Jerusalem will rise in all her
glory
And her vats shall overflow
with corn, oil and wine."
1913;Boaz And Ruth;C;"Boaz has left His palace

Ruth the Moabite

Chorus
A story of love started in the
fields
At harvest time between
Ruth and Boaz
A story of hearts that are
bound forever
At adoption time

Instructions were given to
the harvest chief
For her to be looked after
This Gentile daughter
For right there in the field at
harvest time
For so much love in His heart
He felt for her
At any cost to redeem her

This beautiful lady
That’s what He thought
about
since love at first sight
Right there in the fields at
adoption time
Forevermore she would be
His bride
Eternally she would bear a
New Name

A great story of love
Between me and my Saviour
A story of hearts
Bound for eternity"

Right now it seems that there’s
 no way out and you’re going
 under,
But, God’s proven time and time
 again, He’ll take care of you.

CHORUS
And He’ll do it again,
He’ll do it again,
If you just take a look,
At where you are now,
And where you have been.
For hasn’t He always come
 through for you,
He’s the same now as then.
You may not know how,
You may not know when,
But He’ll do it again.

My God knows the pain,
You’re going through and He
 knows how you’re hurting,
You see, He knows just how
 your heart has been broken in
 two.
But He’s the God of the stars
 and of the sun and of the sea,
And He is your Father.
He can calm the storm and find a
 way, To take care of you.

He’s still God
And He will not fail you;
He’s still God
And He cannot change.
Know that He’s God
And He’s fighting for you,
Just like Moses,
Just like Daniel,
Just like Shadrack, Meshack,
Abednego."
1939;Worship The Lord;;"God will not reject your prayer,
Praying makes you stronger,
I have never seen the righteous forsaken,
Begging for bread or left to suffer,
Have patience, just wait and see,
What God will do,
When you lift up your hands and
 surrender,
God will pull you through.

Chorus
Oh worship, Simply worship,
If you are crying worship,
In your trials worship,
If you are hurting worship,
Nothing matters worship,
He will hear your praise.

God goes before you say ""Let there be"",
He's healing your wounds and setting 
 you free,
Sending his angels fighting from all sides,
He's leading the way, Yes! He is the guide,
Trust in Him, He will never fail,
He'll walk with you along life's rugged
 trail,
Just lift up your hands this is your victory
 day, Give him praise.

Worship the Lord X8

It is important, to understand,
When God is speaking,
Sometimes He may seem to be silent,
But that is when He is working,
Have patience wait and see,
What God will do,
You lift up your hands and surrender,
God will pull you through.

1944;The Widow Woman;;"There was nothing left, Just a
 little bit of oil that was all she had,
The situation looked hopeless,
Life seemed empty, the fire that
 she had was gone and she could
 no longer sustain her family
A widow with nothing, She was a
 widow with nothing, That was her story.

With the creditors approaching
In her most desperate time of need
 she stood all alone, No friends no family
They had their charges, You cannot
 pay your debt your children will
 become a ransom, They shall be taken
She cried oh Lord I have nothing left
I'm a widow with nothing,
That was her testimony

But when God heard her desperate cry
He came down for his own
He quickly came to her as he heard
 the cry of his own and He led her to
 find Elijah the prophet for that hour

Go Thus saith the Lord
God had already told me
Your troubles will be gone
The story of your life will be
 different from now on,
Bring every jar can find God will
 transform your life
The little oil that you have will be multiplied

Even now right now
Your children will never be slaves and 
 you will never be in debt anymore
God has chosen you and in your home
 He will work a paradox

And the house that was empty 
 now has everything
The widow who was weeping can rejoice
 and sing, Where there nothing
Today you can have it all
Step up by faith and see God 
 multiply your oil.

Now your fire is burning shine your light
 each day, You've touched the hem 
 of his garment as he passed your way
Those who saw you suffer in the hands debt
Now see the blessings of the Lord

Even now 
Right now

could bear,
And I was on the verge of just
giving over:
The strength within myself just

CHORUS
Something keeps holding me,
Everyday I see,
He’s helping me faithfully
To overcome my trials;
He’s guiding me constantly,
Giving me victory,
He’s a reality;
Something keeps holding me.

Satan laid before me his temptation
Of his desire to steal away my faith,
But I have found in time the
revelation,
The strength I need to keep me
by His grace."
1951;I Could Never Praise Him Enough;;"For many years I've served the Lord

But if I were to spend

Praising Him for everything
He's ever done for me

Chorus
I could never Praise Him enough
For the cross of calvary
I could never Thank Him enough
For salvation full and free
I could never do anything
To deserve such perfect love
Or for everything He's done
I could never praise Him enough


A thousand tongues could never tell
Just what our Lord has done
As if He hadn't done enough
He sent his Only Son
To hang upon a rugged cross
 And bear the load of sin
That's explains why I can't express
The love I have for Him

So I'll sing 
Thank you Lord for saving my soul
Thank you Lord for making me whole
I could never do anything
To deserve such perfect love
Or (Lord) for everything HE's(You've) done *3
I could never praise Him enough"

The more that I love Him
More love He bestows 
Each day is like heaven

Every need He is supplying
Plentious grace He bestows
Everyday my way gets brighter
The longer I serve Him

He's waiting to guide you

Are you troubled o'er things to come?
Is your future unclear?
 and are you dreading the coming dawn?

Look at what you have done
Look at your mistakes

But praise be to God, for the
 precious blood He shed
On Calvary, for a sinner like you
 and me
So when your enemy comes
 to take away your faith
Point him back to Calvary
 where the price was paid

Chorus
If we weren’t meant to be Bride
We wouldn’t hear these secret
 things, We wouldn’t be still standing
 here, Serving God with our everything
Didn’t He promise us, A new body
 change, Can you feel it now? 
It is your theophany
There’s a voice inside of me
saying we’ll be leaving soon
So press on by the grace of God
And we will make it through

There is a place prepared for
  you and me,
It’s called our future home
 where we’ll live eternally
And though the battle here is
 raging
With eyes of faith I see
The bride of Christ, New

Hark! The voice of God is calling,
To the harvest calling you.

Chorus
Little is much when God is in it!
Labor not for wealth of fame;
There's a crown, and you can win it,
If you go in Jesus' name.

In the mad rush of the broad way,
In the hurry and the strife,
Tell of Jesus' love and mercy,
Give to them the Word of Life.

Does the place that you're called to labor
Seem so small and little known?
It is great if God is in it,
And He'll not forget his own.

Are you laid aside from service,
Body worn from toil and care?
You can still be in the battle,
In sacred place of prayer.

When the conflict here is ended
And our race on earth is run,
He will say, if we are faithful,
""Welcome home, my child-well done!"""

 He is Lord.

Let nothing stand in your way, 
Issues of blood, troubles and confusion

Only believe, just confess it 
And you will receive

 that seventh dove 
And Lord how we long for you 
 to come and fill us now
Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly
 Dove brood over us
Find your resting place in our hearts

The Lord, my Rock, my Light and Salvation,
In you I believe and by your blood
We rebuke all lying vanities
Though an host encamp against me
To release fear and insecurity 
I stand confident Lord
You will keep and deliver me

Lord I believe 
Nothing shall stand in my way 
Issues of blood, troubles and

Restore unto us the joy of
our salvation that when
you return to Zion you
shall find a bride risen out
of the ashes, spotless,
victorious, marching
onward Christian soldiers.

A risen Jerusalem,
claiming our healing,
claiming our deliverance,
claiming your peace, no
more captivity, no more
mind battles, no more
shackles.
This is your revival, this is
our revival.

At the end of the age;
God has made known to us,
The mystery of His will.

We were chosen and
predestinated,
For such a Time as this;
We are coming out of,
And going in

To the other side,
I will be there
Once a stranger without
fellowship,
Now in Christ I have citizenship.
To the other side,
Will you be there?

Who was dead in sins and
trespasses,
There’s a body prepared
(waiting) for you,
On the other side

We are living in the promise
For this day
Back to our origin
God has made a way

The bride is the final voice,
And she has turned at the west,
Our victory is sure
We have an open door

To the other side,
I will be there
Once a stranger without
fellowship,
Now in Christ I have citizenship.
To the other side,
Will you be there?

Who was dead in sins and
trespasses,
There’s a body prepared
(waiting) for you,
On the other side

When thou passeth through
rough waters.
I will be with thee.
And thou walkest through the fire,
It will not hurt thee.

For I am the Lord thy God,
And thou art precious in my sight
You shall have no other God but me,
Because I have no other wife but
thee

To the other side,
I will be there
Once a stranger without
fellowship,
Now in Christ I have citizenship.
To the other side,
Will you be there?

Who was dead in sins and
trespasses,
There’s a body prepared
(waiting) for you,
On the other side

This is the Stars’ Wars
We stand with Plaides and Orion
Look to the unseen
For our battle is not carnal

Mt. Zion, mix the Word with Faith
The Lion roars, and nations shake
The Bride is dwelling under the
Palm Tree.

To the other side,
I will be there
Once a stranger without
fellowship,
Now in Christ I have citizenship.
To the other side,
Will you be there?

Who was dead in sins and
trespasses,
There’s a body prepared
(waiting) for you,
On the other side

In this Ephesians all things are
under her feet
Seeds of Abraham under
preparation,
For the rapture between six and
nine.

To the other side,
I will be there
Once a stranger without
fellowship,
Now in Christ I have citizenship.

He died for me

I never saw the
many burdens,
That my Saviour bore
I never saw the crown
of thorns,
That my Jesus wore,
I never saw that lonely hill,
Where he was crucified
No I never saw it, 
But I believe for me He died

I never saw the rusty nails
That they drove through his
hands and feet
I wasn't there to hear Him say
Father why have thou forsaken me
I never saw the roman soldier
When they pierced Him in His side
But when He hung His head
In the locks of His shoulders
I believe for me He died."

Knock and the door shall be opened 
Seek and ye shall find

When that last trumpet sound
And all that have died in Christ 
They begin to rise up from the ground 
Then we that remain 
We that are still alive 
Will then find out that

I'll never leave you
Nor will I forsake you
But I'll be with you 
Even to the end of the world

The Lord is my Shepherd
And I shall not want
I'm able to walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
Fearing no evil
For Thou art with me
Thy rod and Thy staff
 
They comfort me
Surely goodness and mercy
Is gonna follow me
All the days of my life
And I'm gonna dwell in the house 
Of the Lord
Forevermore

The Lord is my light 
And my salvation
Whom shall I fear?
For I know that He is 
The strength of my life
I have no reason to be afraid

They that wait upon the Lord
Shall renew their strength
I'm able to mount with wings
I can run and not be weary
I can walk and not faint
Wait and see upon the Lord"
