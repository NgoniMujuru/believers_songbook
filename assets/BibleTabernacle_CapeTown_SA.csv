Thou thinkest Lord of me
What need I fear when Thou art near
And thinkest Lord of me";
472;When The Redeemed Gather (PBW);F;"I am thinking of the rapture 
In our blessed home on high.
When the redeemed are gathering in;
How we'll raise the heavenly anthem 
In that city in the sky,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

CHORUS
When the redeemed 
Are gathering in,
Washed like snow, 
And free from all sin;
How we'll shout, 
And how we'll sing,
When the redeemed 
Are gathering in.

There will be a great procession 
Over on the streets of gold,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Oh what music, Oh what singing, 
O'er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption's story 
With their voices clear and strong,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Then the angels all will listen, 
For they cannot join that song,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Then the Saviour will give orders 
To prepare the banquet board,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
And we'll hear His invitation, 
""Come, ye blessed of the Lord,""
When the redeemed are gathering in.";
473;I'm Looking For A City (PBW);;"I'm looking for a city,
The one not made by hands,
I'm looking over Jordan,
I see the promised land,
The waters will be parted
And I'll be on my way,
As we're crossing over Jordan 
I can say:

CHORUS
Now I have that everlasting joy within,
Since He came and took away my sin,
The moment that He blessed me,
He made me fully whole,
With that everlasting joy 
Within my soul.

I'm drinking from the fountain
That floweth from on high,
A well of blessed waters
That never shall run dry,
I'm feasting on God's manna,
I'm praying day by day,
And that everlasting joy 
Is here to stay.

I've heard the prophet's message, 
I've placed it in my heart,
I've got the revelation 
That never shall depart,
The Rapture is upon us,
The stage is set to go.
We have this precious promise 
We all know."
474;The Original Life (PBW);G;"God's attributes were manifested
To His Bride in this last age.
We have caught the revelation
By the last prophet's message.
And we know who we are
And what we are raised up for,
Praise the Lord, for the Original Life.

CHORUS
The Original Life, the Original Seed
The Original Word is what I believe.
The Son of Man is revealed
The seventh seal is unveiled
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say.
And our names are seen within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin.
Yes, we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who's the Original Life.

Our eyes of understanding
He has opened up at last.
And sweet victory is ours
Who were chained down in the past.
True Jubilee has sounded
And we have responded
To our God, Who's the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power.
Sleeping saints will wake and join us
For translation in this hour.
Gentiles' days will soon be over
Glory, hallelujah!
To our God, Who's the Original Life."
475;Land Of Milk And Honey (PBW);G;"There is a land of milk and honey
There is a land
Where we won't need money.
There is a land 
Shining with jasper.
There we shall see 
Our blessed Saviour.

CHORUS
And that's the reason
We shout ""Hallelujah""
Praising our King across the river.
That shining river
Where the saints will gather
There we shall see 
Our blessed Messiah.

Elijah has come, 
He has done his work already
As John has said, 
The Bride has made ready.
And now we are waiting 
For the coming of Jesus.
For that blessed day
When the Lamb shall take us.

Our hopes are bright, 
Our lamps are burning.
And day by day 
Our hearts are yearning.
This is the evening
He will come in the morning.
Then we shall wait 
Until the dawning."
476;The End Time (PBW);F;"I look and see earth's sorrowing picture,
The hoarding mobs for selfish gain;
Their toil of hand for ease and comfort,
Can they not see, their doom is sealed, it's all in vain.

CHORUS
The end is here, it's now at hand,
The Bride is gathering; the world is failing;
Israel's awak'ning; nations are breaking;
Our prophet taught us, we believe the end is here.

Sirs, this is the time! our prophet spoke of,
The Angel came with a Shout,
The mountain shook as His Voice cried out,
""Time is no more,"" loud and clear the Shout went forth.

Have you considered the end-time Message?
Have you considered Malachi 4?
Revelation 10:7 and St. Luke 17
Proclaims this Message now, and then forevermore."
477;Jehovah Jireh (PBW);C;"Jehovah Jireh, my provider,
You are more than enough for me.
Jehovah Rapha, You are my healer,
By your stripes I am set free.
Jehovah Shammah, You are with me
You supply all my needs
You are more than enough, more than enough
You are more than enough for me!

Jehovah Nissi, You are my Victory,
You are more than enough for me,
Jehovah Tsidkenu, my Righteousness, 
All you are, I now can be.
Jehovah Ra-ah, You're my Shepherd,
Shalom, You are my Peace.
You are more than enough, more than enough;
You are more than enough for me!"
478;He's Here, Elijah's God Is With Us Today (PBW);;"He's here, Elijah's God is with us today,
He's here, to do and will whatever we say,
Behold the bride of Christ in full array,
He's here, Elijah's God is here.

She walks in step 
   with the revealed Word of the hour,
She talks and demons flee 
   before His mighty power,
Behold the Bridegroom, 
   united with His mate
He's here, Elijah's God is here."
479;The Token (PBW);E;"The Lord talked to Moses,
Told him what to say
To the children of Israel 
In Goshen that day.
Slay the Lamb,
Take the blood,
Strike the posts and the door,
For I'll pass through Egypt this night
And smite all the first born.

CHORUS
Let the death angel pass
God's bride safe at last.
In the Token He gave
That we could be saved.
Oh! Hallelujah and glory to God.
The Blood's been applied,
His Spirit abides.
Let the death angel pass.

The sweet Holy Spirit
Is the Token today,
And all that is under it,
God said would be safe.
Outside of this Token
The lost will be found.
If you want your loved ones saved,
Better get them in now."
480;I Feel The Pull (PBW);G;"At night I lay in bed
And I begin to cry,
And my mind just fails to know
Exactly why.
I can't explain with tongue or pen
The spirit's groanings deep within;
It must be God, here in my soul,
Because I feel the pull.

CHORUS
I feel the pull, I hear the call,
And I know His Spirit's moving me
To give my all.
He speaks to me, and I agree,
Lord, please come and take control;
I feel the pull.

I went to hear the Word
And with each line and phrase;
He was drawing me
To give a higher praise.
There's a deep call to the deep
Like a great magnet pulling me;
I know for sure
That I'll reach the goal,
Because I feel the pull."
481;Where There's A Deep Calling (PBW);C;"We see the tree in the winter
The green leaves are turned 
   brown and red
The life that was there has gone 
   back to the ground
It looks like the tree is dead
There is a promise of springtime
That life will be made anew
It speaks of the resurrection morning
It shows that God's Word is true

Chorus
Where there's a deep, deep calling
There's a deep, deep to respond
Where there's a hope for a city
There's a land beyond the sun
Where there's a yearning, burning
to leave this world that we have known
There is a King returning, coming 
   to take us home.

Each one must come to his winter
And God all His children has saved
That though they may lay us beneath 
   the cold ground
The life that is there is not dead
We have a promise of springtime
That life would be made anew
We'll meet at the resurrection morning
We'll sail beyond the blue

God's seed had to die and be buried
In Luther it started to sprout
The work had begun, drawn forth 
   by the sun
The message of faith brought it out
Then came the stalk by John Wesley
The Holy Ghost made the wheat grow
Then the chaff and the wheat separated
God's seventh angel's word made it so"
482;The Pillar of Fire (PBW);;"What we have is the pillar of fire
Leading the church of God again
Leading us back to the Bible
Leading us away from sin
Showing the resurrected savior
Showing Himself alive again
And what we have is the pillar of fire
Leading the church of God again.

The pillar of fire led the children of Israel
Led them out of Egypt's land
Led them to the rock of the water
Led them to the manna in God's hand
Led them to God's holy mountain
He wanted just to speak unto them
But He wasn't finished with them yet
He led them to the promised land.

The early church had the pillar of fire
Leading each and every day
Showing to all the sinners
That Jesus is the only way
Without the Blood there is no salvation
Without the Spirit there is no love
And what we have is the pillar of fire
Burning in the hearts of men.

What we need is the Pillar of Fire
Leading the church of God again
Leading us back to the Bible
Leading us away from sin
Knowing the resurrected Saviour 
Showing Himself alive again
What we need is the Pillar of Fire 
Leading the church of God again"
483;In The Presence Of Jehovah (PBW);C;"In and out of situations
That tug of war at me
All day long I struggle
For answers that I need
But then I come into His presence
And all my questions become clear
And for that sacred moment
No doubts can interfere.

CHORUS
In the presence of Jehovah,
God Almighty, Prince of Peace;
Troubles vanish,
Hearts are mended
In the presence of the King.

Through His love the Lord provided
A place for us to rest
A place to find the answers
In the hour of distress
Now there's never any reason
For you to give up in despair
Just slip away and breathe His name
He will surely meet you there."
484;I'LL See You In The Rapture (PBW);Eb;"If we never meet again on this earth, my precious friend,
If, to God, we have been true and we've lived above all sin;
Then, for us, there'll be a greeting,
For there's gonna be a meeting,
I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day.

CHORUS
I'll see you in the rapture, see you in the rapture,
See you at that meeting in the air;
There, with our blessed Savior, we'll live and reign forever,
I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day.

To my loved ones let me say that there'll surely come a day,
When the Lord will come again and He'll take His bride away;
So, get ready now to meet Him, and with hallelujahs greet Him,
I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day."
485;These Are The Days Of Elijah (PBW);G;"These are the days of Elijah,
Declaring the Word of the Lord;
And these are the days of your servant, Moses,
Righteousness being restored.
And though these are the days of great trials,
Of famine and darkness and sword
Still we are the voice in the desert crying,
""Prepare ye the way of the Lord!""

CHORUS
Behold He comes, riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call.
Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes.

These are the days of Ezekiel,
The dry bones becoming as flesh
And these are the days of your servant, David
Rebuilding a temple of praise
And these are the days of the harvest
The fields are as white in the world
And we are the laborers in your vineyard
Declaring the Word of the Lord.

There's no God like Jehovah (x7)"
486;Come And Dine (PBW);;"Jesus has a table spread
Where the saints of God are fed,
He invites His chosen people,  ""Come and dine,""
With His manna He doth feed 
And supplies our ev'ry need;
O 'tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the time!

CHORUS
""Come and dine,"" the Master calleth,
""Come and dine;""
You may feast at Jesus' table
  all the time; 
He who fed the multitude,
Turned the water into wine,
To the hungry calleth now,
""Come and dine.""

The disciples came to land, 
Thus obeying Christ's command,
For the Master called to them,
""O come and dine;""
There they found their hearts' desire,
Bread and fish upon the fire;
Thus He satisfies the hungry ev'ry time.

Soon the Lamb will take His bride
To be ever at His side,
All the host of heaven will
  assembled be;
O 'twill be a glorious sight,
All the saints in spotless white;
And with Jesus they will feast eternally."
487;Justified (PBW);Eb;"I was sitting alone and wondering
About what I'm suppose to do:
I can't deny that times I make mistakes
I can't hide from Him: He knew.
But, I know that deep within my soul
I felt sorry: Honest I do.
So I just cry, and say ""Forgive me, Lord.
Forgive me again, will You""

Chorus
Justified, Justified,
You have not done it in the first place,
You're justified.
Justified, Justified,
You have not done it in the first place,
You're justified.

So often I've been discouraged
When I count the times I fall
""Cause He promised I'll be victorious,
When I know I'm not at all.
Then I heard an Eagle scream:
His voice quickened my soul.
He said, ""You have not done it in the first place:
You're justified.""

He looked at your perfect picture
Without blame, spot, or wrinkle.
He didn't look at you where you are now;
He looked from eternity.
He said, ""You're just trapped in that body;
You bypassed your theophany;
You have not done it in the first place,
You're justified."""

The Word of God will guide us home.

Chorus

So I long to be translated
Just to tell You face to face

Face to face
So I can truly sing Your praise

The time I long for all these days
Face to face
Beholding the beauty of Your face

Yes I long to meet You Lord
So I can really praise You Lord
Face to face

When I think about that great day
When I'll meet You in the air
And then to the marriage supper
Like Isaac with Rebecca
Then You'll come and lift the veil
Off Your dear Bride's face
Lord I'm dressed and I am waiting
Just to see You
Face to face

Face to face
So I can truly sing Your praise
Face to face
The time I long for all these days
Face to face
Beholding the beauty of Your face
How I long to tell You Lord

So I can really praise You Lord
Face to face

When I think about our future home 
Of the Bride and Christ alone
 How we'll dwell in the New Jerusalem
Upon Your royal throne
For Your prophet came and told us 
About this perfect place
And I want to say how I love You
Just to tell You
Face to face

Face to face
So I can truly sing Your praise
Face to face
The time I long for all these days
Face to face
Beholding the beauty of Your face
How I long to tell You Lord
Yes I long to meet You Lord
So I can really praise You Lord
Face to face

Yes I long to tell You Lord
And I want to meet You Lord
So I can really praise my Lord
Face to face"
490;From The Earthly (PBW);C;"Chorus
From the earthly to the 
   heavenly
From this body to our 
   theophany
From this old pest house 
   to our Father's house
There's a mansion He's 
   built for you and me

If our earthly house of this 
   tabernacle be dissolved
We have another one waiting
Eternal in the heavens
He said I go to prepare a 
   place for you
That where I am there you 
   may be also

In this body we groan desiring 
   to be clothed upon
With our new bodies celestial 
   in the heavens
So when this corruption shall 
   now put on incorruption
Then mortality shall be 
   swallowed up of life

Soon we'll lay aside this old 
   rugged robe of flesh
In exchange for a glorious one 
   prepared in the heavens
And at the resurrection at 
   the sounding of the trump
Our bodies will be glorified 
   just like Jesus"
491;God's Eagles (PBW);F;"I lived in a world of sin and shame
That only caused me grief 
   and pain
And I tried so hard to be free
Searching for my true identity
Didn't know I came from eternity
Until God came and revealed 
   it to me

Chorus
On the wings of a snow-white    
   dove
God sends His pure sweet love
On the wings of a snow-white
   dove
To take His eagles home
(Repeat)

I knew somehow I was born to fly
Way up in the sky
But somehow I couldn't set my 
   wings free
But since that day I heard His Voice
And made Him my heavenly choice
By His grace I can say I've been 
   set free

Now behold what manner of love
The Father hath bestowed upon us
That we might be called the Sons 
   of God!
Wherever He bids us we will go
Wherever He leads we will follow
'Cause who the Son has set free is 
   free indeed"
492;His Voice Makes The Difference (PBW);;"Chorus
His Voice makes the difference
When He speaks He relieves 
   my troubled mind
It's the only Voice I hear that 
   makes the difference
And I'll follow that Voice all 
   the time

When I needed Him
I know where to find Him
In my place of prayer
   His Spirit covers me
Oh His voice gently gives me 
   My direction
And I'll follow one day at a time

Rev. 10 verse 7
Is the voice in this last day and age
Is the only voice I know 
   That makes the difference
And I'll follow this voice all the time

Oh His voice, 
Its a strong and Mighty tower
Tearing down every stronghold in my life
He's the master of the wind 
   and sea that rages
When He speaks 
   all my darkness turns to light

I have heard other
   voices speaking to me
To deceive and to lead me astray
But my Shepherd's voice
   is different from all others
I'm His sheep and 
   I know my Shepherd's voice"
493;I Was On His Mind (He knew me) (PBW);;"There's no one great among us
We're nothing on our own
We make mistakes and often slip
Just common flesh and bones
But someday I'll prove just what 
   He says, I'm of a special kind
When He was on the cross
I was on His mind

CHORUS
He knew me, yet He loved me
He whose glory makes the 
   heavens shine
So unworthy of such mercy
Yet when He was on the cross
I was on His mind

A look of love was on His face
The thorns upon His head
The blood drops on that 
   spotless robe
Stained it a crimson red
Though His eyes were on the 
   crowd that day
He looked ahead in time
For when He was on the cross
You and I were on His mind"

Through the skies on eagles wings
To meet our Father there
And we will sit down at His Glorious

It will be worth it all when we go home

We got the faith
We fought the fight
And we have the victory
The battle is won
We have fulfilled God's Word
And we are waiting to go home"

My theophany, I hear it calling me

Don't you worry little children
Should death knock at your door
Don't you know there's a doorway
That leads to the heavenly shore
Where there's no heartache
No dying in that Land
Peace and joy
Perfect love beyond compare

Over the next hill I look, I see 
   the victory
Around the next turn in the road
Well the devil's got to flee
God's army is marching, marching 
   onward, to slay the enemy
Over the next hill, I see Jesus 
   calling me

And He's calling come up 
A little higher into the perfect Word
Come Up, a little higher
Into Agapo Love
And He's calling come up 
A little higher

In the Holy place made clean
But in the Holy of Holies
It's the Holy Ghost Himself
The mighty Presence of Jehovah

In Jesus dwells the fullness of 
   the Godhead, don't you see
Jesus is the great I AM and the

""He rejoiced to see My day""
When Jesus spoke these precious 
   words they stoned Him right away
""Why do you stone Me?"" Jesus 
   said in a holy, sweet command
""Because you say you're the great 
   I AM we believe you're just a man""

It was on the Day of Pentecost oh

There is a King returning, coming 
   to take us home.

Each one must come to his winter
And God all His children has saved
That though they may lay us beneath 
   the cold ground
The life that is there is not dead
We have a promise of springtime
That life would be made anew
We'll meet at the resurrection morning
We'll sail beyond the blue

God's seed had to die and be buried
In Luther it started to sprout
The work had begun, drawn forth 
   by the sun
The message of faith brought it out
Then came the stalk by John Wesley
The Holy Ghost made the wheat grow
Then the chaff and the wheat separated
God's seventh angel's word made"
502;A Living Reality (PBW);F;"God gave a promise 
To His bride in this last days
Priests and Kings He's made us
And forever we shall reign
We're following an eternal order
Way beyond the humanistic realm
God lifting us to a higher place only 
By His grace

CHORUS
We're a living reality
We are His Holy Word
The substance of the shadow
The fulfillment of His Word
We're a living reality
We're the mystery revealed
Christ manifested in us
He in us and we in Him

Our natural birth brought five senses
To relate to natural things
But by our new birth
We received the sixth sense faith
Faith the Holy Spirit
Came in us to dwell again
A circumcised people
Greater works we'll do again

Faith relates to Melchizedec
And we are the faith
Faith is the substance 
God in flesh again
We are not on Mt. Sinai
But now raised up to Mt. Zion
Like our father Abraham
From the dust to the stars 
We were made"
503;Are You She (W);;"I slipped through the gates of pearl as 
   Peter greeted me
And one by one I met the saints I'd 
   longed so much to see
I saw my hero Stephen, Paul and Timothy
But before my breath could find the words
I heard them speak to me

Are you she, the bride of the last days
Who stood the worst of times
When so many slipped away?
Here's your crown, take your place 
   beside the Throne 
Christ is now your very own
Is this the special chosen one we see?
Are you she?

It was the worst of all the ages, they 
   continued to say
How did you live a Christian life
In such a Godless day?
Question after question my hereos 
   lifted me
Then I heard a voice behind me, 
   whisper tenderly

This is she, the bride of the last days
Who stood the worst of times
When so many slipped away
Here's your crown, take your place 
   beside the Throne. 
I am now your very own
This is the special chosen one you see
This is she!

These trials that you're facing, may 
   seem so big and tall
But when we hear the Master speak
It will make it worth it all

You are she, the bride of the last days
Who stood the worst of times,
When so many slipped away
Here's your crown, take your place 
   beside the Throne. 
Christ is now your very own
This is the special chosen one you see
You are she!"
504;By His Word (PBW);A;"It is written that man should 
   not live by bread alone
But by every Word that comes 
   from the mouth of God
And by His Word He gave His 
   Son for us on Calvary
To pay the price of sin for you 
   and me

By His Word
He raised the sick man 
   from the bed
By His Word
He gave life unto the dead
By His Word
He brings hope to the 
   hopeless souls

By His Word
You can have the victory
By His Word
He has set the captive free
By His Word
He gave life to you and me

Just one Word was broken in Eden 
   and thats what caused the fall
So it will take all of the Word to 
   bring us back to God
And through this last day Message 
all the Word has been made known
And by His power we have 
   overcome

By His Word
He spoke and squirrels did appear
By His Word
Storm go back from where you came
By His Word
Little fishy I give you back your life

By His Word
He spoke a tumour out of existance
By His Word
He gave two boys salvation
By His Word
He gave life to you and me

By His Word
We'll be changed like Abraham and Sarah
By His Word
We'll be caught away like Elijah
By His Word
We will wake the sleeping saints
By His Word
Then go to the wedding supper
By His Word
And we'll see our blessed Savior
By His Word
We will live eternally"
505;Dying To Be Reunited (PBW);G;"Chorus
I’m dying to be reunited 
   and in my soul I’m excited
I’m dying to be reunited with the
One Who’s always known me

Always inside of me there was 
   a deep that was calling
But there never was a deep to respond
Then my heart began searching
I didn’t know what for 
   until the day He came
Until He called my name
Now I can never never ever 
   be the same 

Indeed He came to me
But that wasn’t all
The words He spoke to me 
   controlled my heart 
And daily I die a death 
   unseen to human eyes
Until they see in me God manifest in flesh
Now I can never, never ever be the same

Bridge
I’m looking for a change in the inside
That will manifest on the outside
I’m looking for a change in the inside
That will manifest on the outside
A body change in the twinkle of an eye 

Ending
I’m dying to be reunited
With the One Who’s always known me"
506;Eagle Scream (PBW);G;"All my life I searched for the truth
I struggled deep inside
I knew this life just would not do
There was no comfort in,
   some man's philosophy
I felt so out of place, 
In this wondrous place
I had to know

Chorus
And then an eagle screamed
Child come out of her
I'll take you in my arms
And lead you to The Word
Come on lets spread your wings
I'll teach you how to fly
I've been so happy since,
I heard God's eagle cry.

There I was In the nest of unbelief 
Another empty heart 
Was really all I could see 
I needed something fresh 
To feed my hungry soul 
I felt so out of place, for this wondrous grace 
I had to know."

And the same gentle hands

They conquered death to 
   bring me victory

Was the precious life He gave

By the hearing of the word

A need to know as we were always known
For it won't be long again 
You can see we are at the end
Slack not your riding 
Continue to sigh and cry
You must have that token 
To take that heavenly flight

Though we've grieved by various trials 
That the genuiness of our faith may be tried
For at the end of our faith 
We'll receive salvation for our soul
A glorious body a son in the image of the word
United with theophany
We'll be one with the living God

Even in death she testified 
  that all is well.

Chorus
All is well, all is well,
We have heard the message, Shalom, 
All is well.
There is a place of perfect rest
Behind the inner veil.
So rest little Bride, rest for all is well.

Now things have not worked out,
Like God's people thought.
For we're still here fighting 
The greatest battle ever fought.
We must have the faith of Abraham,
Knowing God's Word never fails.
If we'll trust in Him, we'll find

510;I Will Restore Saith The Lord (BW);;"Bride, do you remember
Way back to your former rain
Where you once stood in position
Having dominion and all things under your feet
But you fell, you fell from that fellowship
And you wondered, where you went wrong
So you cry out, you thirst for that latter rain
And you'll fight for that power again

You see the palmerworm came 
   in your life and ate
Then the cankerworm came in your life and ate
Then the caterpillar and locust ate
But God promised, yes He promised

That I will restore saith the Lord x 2
Jehovah promised a Holy Ghost promise
I will restore thus saith the Lord x 2

Power shall come from on high
After the Holy Ghost comes upon you
And you shall be witnesses 
   unto Me throughout the world
All My glory shall all men behold

For I shall come, unto you as the former rain
As the latter rain to you shall I come
And all men shall testify
That you have the evidence
That Jesus rose from the dead
And in your own atmosphere
God will visit you there
For you were meant to be mighty men 
   of valor and He promised

That I will restore saith the Lord x 2

I'm redeemed and I'll proclaim
I'm not my own I'm not the same
I am forgiven of every sin and 
There's no more stain
And the faith to run this race
I know its by His amazing grace
What a thrill just to know I am 
   redeemed

Before the foundation was ever laid
In His mind I was saved
He predestinated me to be His 
   glorious Bride
Then I heard that great eagle scream
The attribute of God inside of me
Leaped for joy knowing that 
I have been redeemed

Now I stand in Him complete
Waiting for my change for the sweep
Resting in His election, Its all what

And the grave is not my goal death
Is abolished it has no control

The way to come in your presence
You've clothed us in your Word

Lord we only want your desire
For in you, we've found favour
For whatsoever we ask of you
You will grant it to us

Lord you've shown us Haman's evil schemes
But you've made a way of escape
You've kept Mordecai's words alive to us
Through your faithful servant Hatach
For such a time as this
We came into your kingdom
Now we are the ones through whom
You deliver your people in bondage."

When on the cross He laid

516;Thank You Lord (W);;"I saw the S-u-n go down yesterday
And in its place, darkness appeared
I saw the grains of wheat 
   awaiting the Sun's return
Without the promise of the Sun light
They know they'll surely die

And after time and time had pass
I saw a little sunlight at last
A little more then a little more
Then a little more sunlight 
   than before

But at the breaking of a 
   brand new dawn
I saw the fullness, the risen sun
I remember what God had 
   done for me 
When He took my sins to Calvary
(Thank you Lord)

Thank you for a faithful resurrection
(Thank you Lord)
Oh what a blessed consolation
(Thank you Lord)
When I found nothing of worth in me
You broke the seals of Calvary

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
(Thank you Lord)
I was lost but now am found
(Thank you Lord)
An there is nothing going wrong
I'm a witness, to the rising of the Son

I saw the S-o-n go down at Nicea Rome
Before Paul left at Ephesus
He said there'll appear grevious wolves
The serpent found a way to break 
   The Sons influence
He preached his doctrines of lies
So down and down the gospel went
He showed a little light in Smyrna

And many saw Him at Pergamos
But less light in Thyatira age
And Luther saw Him in Sardis Age
It was 1750 a man by the name John Wesly
He saw a little Son light in Philadelphia
And many saw Him in Laodicea

But at the Breaking of a Brand new dawn
The Son came clothed in a Cloud
With one foot on the sea 
   and one foot on the land
The fullness of the Son 
   was in the Son of Man
(Thank you Lord)
Thanks for Revelation 10:7

He took the mystery of this risen Son
To every kindred and every nation

And they were thankful
for the rising of the Son___

Revelation 10:8 to 11

Fly across the lonely years;
And old home scenes of my childhood,
In fond memory appear.

In the stillness of the midnight,
Echoes from the past I hear;
Old-time singing, gladness bringing,
From that lovely land somewhere.

Know not what the years may hold;
As I ponder, hope grows fonder,
Precious memories flood my soul.

Flood my soul from day to day,
I remember scenes so precious
That can never pass away.

That day's end is near at hand,
But I remember that he promised
He'd return for those who'd stand.

Precious memories, glorious meetings
Across this land from sea to sea
Where I heard the prophet's Message
That brought Life and hope to me.

Where the Food was laid away,
We've returned to where he stored It,

Arise, possess your inheritance,
For this is the year of jubilee,
Arise, be not entangled with the yoke of bondage.
Understand the liberty by which Christ set you free.

Entangled with heavy chains of captivity,
Bruised and battered by sin,
Condemned and sentenced to a life of bondage,
O God, there was no peace within.
Then a sound was heard,
It was like the abundance of rain,
Saying ""Rejoice, you have received the atonement,
Accept the pardoning word which was provided for you,
Because you're not of the bondwoman,
You're of the free.""

Aren't you tired of living underprivileged?
Saints, don't you, don't you hear that sound?
Saying freedom to the captives,
Restoration to the blind,
Setting free those who are bruised.
Saints, empty your vessels,
Let Him fill them with oil,
You are free, you are free, you are free.
So when the creditor comes to take away your land,
Show him your account
Settled long ago by Calvary's Lamb,
And say, ""I am free, I am free, I am free."" 

Now I can tell the world that I'm free,
I have heard the trumpet sound
Jubilee; Freedom from all burdens and sin,
The Comforter has given me peace within.
And whom the Son has set free, is free indeed."

CHORUS
He is the bridge from Earth to Heaven
We now live in God's presence forever.

I'll always look to Calvary where 
Redemption price was paid for me,
There on the cross, crucified with Him.
There on the cross I was in Him,
There on the cross I paid for my sin,
And His glory, I now boldly enter in.

Lift your eyes to Calvary,
See where He has set you free,
Loosed from the grips of sin and shame.
Sin has no more dominion over you,
You're ordained to do just what you do,
He's that bridge to Heaven for me and you.

To the splendour of His throne,
His Bride now leaves the Earth,
Quickening power now breaks the hold of time;
Travelling faster than the speed of light,
We'll be changed in the twinkling of an eye,
And that bridge to Heaven will be no more."
534;The Ancient Of Days (W);A;"I beheld in the courts of Heaven
Where great treason was opposed:

Kicked out of Heaven with the third of the stars,
Like lightning they fell to the earth,
They mingled the seed of men,
And by deceit, they gained control,
Until...

He plundered and devoured,
having kings to bow at his feet.
But, I beheld till the Prince of Princes came,
Great Michael, en morphe
As the bloody Lamb that was slain,
He brought to us the victory.
He is ....

I beheld this beast was wounded
But his deadly wound was healed:
He cast down the truth, exalted a lie,
Having the whole world to be deceived.
I beheld till a Mighty Angel came
With an open book in His hand,
He gave me skill and wisdom to understand
God's great mystery plan.

I stood in the ranks of a great army,
They were the saints of the most high God;

May Oh Lord, You have the pre-eminence;
For that's the reason why You 	made us,
To achieve Your greatest 	purpose.

Now I stand justified and do appreciate
The out-pouring of Your wonderful grace;
Sanctified from the bondage of sin,
As the Holy Spirit now dwells 	    within.

And now I'm growing in His Grace,
And some day soon I'll see His face."

That tremendous victory in the love divine.

I'm heading down to the Jordan,
Lo, before me I see a vision 
breaking,
A Power that would bind that mamba,
The third pull ministry.

Now's my time for consecration,
I must see a change in me,
I will enter my secret closet,
And close the door behind me.
I'll keep the feast of Unleavened Bread
With truth and sincerity,
For I'm expecting Jehovah-Jireh,
My Lord, to meet with me.

Lord, keep Thy Holy fire burning
Deep in my soul,
Change me from glory unto glory,

Let us draw near with a true heart
In full assurance of faith;
That we find grace and strength to help In time of need.

It took a perfect sacrifice before
We could ever attain to perfect faith;
That's why Christ the perfect Lamb,
The atonement came,
And to the Holiest of Holies,
He cleared the way.

So let us draw near having our hearts
Sprinkled by His blood,
For now we have free access
To the throne of God.

And we daily make mistakes for we are weak,
But we have not a High Priest who cannot be touched
With the feelings of our infirmities."

Freed us from sin;
Now I look unto redemption,

I'll reign with Him one thousand years,
Where there's no sickness, or sadness;
Only joy, no more fears, no more tears.

To heavenly places with You I sit,
You've brought me to that place,
Right where I belong.

Who am I?  Lord consider me,
I'm just a little lump of vanity,
Like a flower that blooms and fades away,
Its mortal life withers every day.
But Lord, You've given me eternal life:
You've even called me Your virtuous wife;
You've brought me to a place,
Right where I belong.

There are people becoming the Word.

This is a treacherous hour;
Search your lives my sisters,

I hold close the opportunity
That's been given me
To serve the Lord in my day;
Tell me what could be a greater privilege

To walk in His provided way.

We can't live in a world of fantasy,
Of worldly thoughts and dreams,

With the ozone layer being destroyed,
Divers earthquakes are everywhere;

The Heaven shall depart like a scroll
Thus saith the Lord
It's exactly what the prophets foretold;
But stand like Micaiah, stay with the seventh seal vision
You just say what Elijah already did say.

Now demons in the atmosphere
Are pressing their way into the hearts of men
Who are marked by God for their iniquity
In rejecting the prophet whom God has sent.
The slaughtering angels are ready
To slay the young and the old,
So watch the cares of this life,
Remember Lot's wife
Who for vanity lost her soul;
Stand like Rahab with your token on display,
For the destroying Angels are already on their way.
But stand like Daniel with your garments undefiled; 
Stand like Micaiah, stay with the seventh seal vision; 
Stand like Rahab with your token on display;
For the destroying Angels are already on their way."

There was a time I was lost and undone

The new Jerusalem
Someday soon I'll cross the great
divide
Someday soon I'll be on the other
side

I've been battle scared, 
been through many wars
But they have only made me
strong
So I'll keep fighting on
In the midst of all adversity I've
stood victoriously 
It is God's grace that gives me victory
So here I stand

BRIDGE
Feeling that strange call of God
I know it's time to leave
Calling to my Father's house
Things that are to be
I see the setting sun
I know I'll find what I'm looking for
From where I stand
I'll walk through the open door"

319;Learning To Lean;G;"Learning to lean,
I'm learning to lean,
I'm learning to lean on Jesus,
Finding more power than I ever dreamed
I'm learning to lean on Jesus.

Sad, broken hearted,
At an altar I knelt.
I found peace that is so serene.
And all that He asks
Is a child like trust
And a heart that is
Learning to lean."

Jesus breaks every fetter,
Jesus breaks every fetter,
And He sets me free.

Which was made for me.

I will never doubt my Savior,
I will never doubt my Savior,
I will never doubt my Savior,
For He cleanses me.

I will rest on His promise,
I will rest on His promise,
I will rest on His promise,
Which is given to me.

I will shout Hallelujah!

Which was ordained for me."
546;Can't You Hear Your Theophany Calling You (PBW);C;"A new day has dawned
And I know not what it brings,
But somehow I feel I'm almost home;
Not turning back to yesterday
But pressing towards my calling in Christ,
I can hear, yes I can hear my theophany calling me.

CHORUS
And can't you hear your theophany calling you?
It's a sign, it's almost home time,
And I'm just waiting for my promised body change,
For soon I know, we'll be with Him on high.

The whole earth is groaning and travailing in pain,
But we as the Bride have been glorified in Him;
And saints, even though we may suffer,
Stand and gird Your loins,
For Your perfection, it draweth near.

My God knows overtime is drawing near,
And very soon the dead in Christ shall rise again;
There'll be no more sickness,
No more crying over there,
But for now, Christian Soldier,
Just keep on pressing."
547;Going Back To The Faith (W);E;"This is the age Malachi 4:5 is fulfilled,
God sent a prophet in this time, for this age;
Despised and rejected by  denomination,
Yet God had a people on the earth to hear his voice;
Out there I was in Egypt land, God called me out by his command,
The way he did with Abraham.

CHORUS
We're going back to the faith,
The faith of our forefathers,
We're going back to the faith where we'll die for eternal life;
We're going back to the faith, into the garden of Eden,
Where we know we were predestinated
Before the  foundation of the world to walk by faith.

This is the age of Laodicea,
Where men and women fight for their rights, for their rights
False doctrine and creeds feel welcome in this world,
For this is the age Satan sits on his throne, on his throne;
This is the age where Jezebel and her harlots celebrate,
Where many are drunken from her wine;
And this is the age where the mysteries go back to the East,
Saints this is the end of the Gentiles' time,
Make sure you  don't get left behind.

We're going back to the faith, 
Yes we are climbing Jacob's ladder,
We're going back to the faith, 
Oh, we are going to stop the sun like Joshua,
We're going back to the faith, 
And like Jesus walk on water,
We're going back to the faith, 
We're going to  translate like Elijah

We're going back to the faith, 
We're going back, we're going back;
We're going back to the faith, 
I want to see my Redeemer's face,
We're going back to the faith, 
I want to thank Him for His grace;
We're going back to the faith, 
I'm gonna shake the prophet's hand
We're going back to the faith,

We're going back to the faith, 
Back to the faith."
548;Strengthen My Hands (W);D;"CHORUS
Strengthen my hands for war
I want to be an overcomer
Strengthen my hands for war
I want to fulfill this word with power

For though two hundred million is gathered against me
In this I'll be confident
If God before me tell me who could be against me
For they are more with us than they with them

For there remaineth much land yet to be possess
Many promises to be fulfill
Can't let circumstances or conditions get us down
For we must fulfill his will

For the mark of this age is perfection
And to miss that mark saints is sin
For Alpha must become Omega
The word made flesh again

In a time of scoffers and mockers
But we are determined that
   the House of God will live again

The many times before when you were in great need
Yet your  Father in His love has never failed
To stand between you and the enemy

And though you stand between a Rock and a hard place
Stand there with faith, believe in His grace

550;Just Once More Lord (W);G;"Spiritual stripped morally broken
With his eyes plucked out
Here stands the man with all of his stature
But with no power in his life
Raised up by God and given power
To put to flight the armies of the enemy
But gave away all of his secrets
Was now bound and in captivity
In the book of his remembrance
Were all the great victories he had won
Realizing his present condition 
From deep down inside this cry began

CHORUS
Just once more Lord
Just once more Lord
So we can see your power 
   moving once again
Just once more Lord

Repenting of all mistakes and failures
Praying in his heart Lord let me die
Not considering what it would cost him
Should God hear and  would answer 
   his sincere cry
For he could feel his locks had grown out
Thinking is there a possibility of the power 
   of God coming back
Began to cry more earnestly

Just once more Lord
Just once more Lord
So we can feel your Spirit moving once again
Just once more Lord

Inaugurated at Pentecost
Signs and wonders, manifestation of His name
But there at the council of Nicea
The early church had its locks shaved
With a promise of restoration
We have seen God's church rise in power 
   through each stage
Until God sent to us a prophet
And we have seen the fullness of God's life on display
But its been so long since the eyes have gone out
And there is a new crop that is coming forth
For greater works and dynamic power to be displayed
May we as Samsons of God cry just once more"
551;This Is The Hour (BW);;"Bride of Christ, for so long we've been waiting
For our promised king has come
We await his appearing
We're being tested, we're being tried

But first the squeeze will come
A quick short ride and then it's done
This is the hour

CHORUS
This is the hour that we've all been waiting for
This is the hour; the bridegroom is at the door
This is the hour, of His appearing
The trumpet shall sound and we'll go home
This is the hour

End time Daniels you arise
This is the time of the evening
The king of Babylon has come
He's plundering and devouring
He's causing men to bow
Passing laws even now
But prayer's the only way out
Daniels trust and don't you doubt
That Michael your prince will stand
And in the fire you'll meet the Son of man
This is the hour

End time Esthers you awake
The Seven Thunders are sounding
for Hatach has brought the news
of the genocide that's coming
It's time to intercede
For your people you must plead
In the spirit of sacrifice
Be willing to give your life
for the sceptor is in the king's hand
And your desire is his command
In this hour

Soon he'll be coming for (3x)
Coming to take me home"

The way to come in your presence
You've clothed us in your word
Now we have access to thy throne
Lord we want only your desire
For with you we've found favour
That whatsoever we ask of You
You'll grant it to us

Lord you showed us Haman's evil schemes
But you made a way of escape
You 've kept Mordecai's words alive to us
Through your faithful servant Hatach
For such a time as this 
We came into your kingdom
Now we are the ones through whom
You'll deliver your people in bondage.

He'll never leave you He'll stay with you all the way

Refuse to compromise
You Esthers and Daniels
For this final ride
Rise up and complete the work that he's bestowed on you
And just forget what you're going through
You just do his work and he'll do yours
We're fighting a battle, fighting a cause
To get all the souls that we have to find
God's determined not one hoof will be left behind
God's determined not one hoof will be left behind

Lord at these junctions how we need more of your unction
To function the way you want us to
As prophesied, the bride of Christ will know what God wants done
To fulfill this word, this eternal truth
For we are the mystery being revealed
The Seven Seals of our lives are no longer sealed
We are the word made plain manifested in flesh again
We are the word made plain manifested in flesh again

555;THE WOUNDED DOVE (BW);A;"From the outer regions of the lost
God has brought us back
Her gates are the gates of hell
And many enter therein

The Thunders uttering
This time they spoke clearly
The mystery of the Seventh Seal
And here we are in the second-fold
of a three-fold mystery
Part being spoken by the Son of man
But the other in you and me

CHORUS
The message of a wounded dove went home
Now it's come back again
In the power of the Word
Speaking resurrection
Speaking rapturing faith
Full redemption
From a fallen state

With the power that will judge the earth 
We are lifted higher
Higher and higher until we all come
into that Seventh peak
And from there we'll change dimensions
Cross into that other land
Where we'll meet friends and loved ones
And those who've already gone

A window now is opened
And the light is shining through
Celestial light from a celestial world
Shining into our souls
The dove and the raven are loosed
Two powers in the earth
One feeding on the flesh of disobedient men
But the dove in you and me
And for this purpose He's descended
A full cycle of time's about ended
And here we are in this reality
While Noah was a coded mystery"
556;A Better World (BW);D;"Take a picture put it in a darkroom
There's a process for it to go through
Take it out when the process is completed

That's how it is with this life here on earth
The shot was taken from another world
Earth is the darkroom where our lives develop
Soon our true beauty will unfold

CHORUS
In a better world, a better place, a better life 
In a better way, with better things
In eternity, that's where we'd be
With the one who died for you and me

Here we see trees struggling to live
But there's a place where they don't
Here we see sickness and dying
There's a place where we won't
We've got no future on this sinful earth
Our eyes are fixed on another world
We've got no treasures here below
There is a place where they are stored

In this world we're pilgrims and strangers
But there's a place where we belong
Soon we'll leave Satan's Eden
Take courage pilgrim it won't be long
Down here we have no continuing city
But we seek the one to come
We desire that heavenly country
God hath prepared our future home"
557;I've Got Leaving On My Mind (BW);Ab / A;"CHORUS
Lately I've got leaving, leaving on my mind
Lately I've got leaving, just to leave this world behind
Leaving, leaving, I've got leaving on my mind
Leaving, Leaving, just leaving this world behind

I've seen a man clothed in white linen
With a writer's ink horn in his hand
Moving to and fro the earth sealing God's children
I've seen the son of man clothed in a cloud
Coming down from on high
And I can't help the way I feel
My redemption draweth nigh
For I've got leaving, leaving on my mind
Leaving, leaving, just to leave this world behind

I see earthquakes in diverse places
Famine on the earth
As God's scripture fulfills rapidly
God's children giving birth
I hear the lion roaring loud in Zion
Just before the quake
And just a little while from now
The sleeping saints will awake
I've got leaving, leaving on my mind

Lord take me to that place I need to be
For my soul just cannot take the things I see
I want to mount up like the eagle in the sky
For lately, I've got leaving, leaving on my mind

Tried like the gold in fire
Purified by fiery trials
My bags are packed for home at last
And I'm not looking back
I've got leaving, leaving, leaving on my mind

So much pressure on the sons of God
To stand for Him in this day
And soon all their privileges will be taken away
I hear the lion roaring loud in Zion
All that can be shaken will be shaken
And very soon the earth will shake
Then the sleeping will awake
For I've got leaving on my mind"

He revealeth unto me, 
   what I was born to be in this day

So I'm staying (On my knees)
Patiently waiting (On my knees)
For your outpouring (On my knees)
Oh Lord I need You (On my knees)

Now I believe, 
   that I was born a predestinated seed
Amazing grace, 
   has chosen me to run this race
So I will give my life to Him, 
   perfected without sin
I can't do this on my own, 
   Lord put flesh on these dry bones
If it takes my life to give, 
   for You I will live I need You Lord

BRIDGE
I've read the scriptures in the Bible, 
About the Mighty Gentile Warriors
The painful desire of Hannah,
And the fearless move of Esther
Lord I believe that they were true, 
And the token they received, 
   but what about me?
I know my battles are all won, 
   that's why I sing my song
I know blessings are all mine, 
   but it will just take time
So like Elijah here I stay,
With faith in such a way to know you'll come"

Saying don't you ever give up, keep holding to my word

He wants to dwell in me

Lord we believe, you and your word are one
Moulding us, preparing a bride,
We know we are the one (we are the ones)
You took us from the chains of death from our lives
One standing in our midst, to bring this word to life

We know the locust came to deform our lives
To make us doubt the word of God by telling us lies
But to this the hidden mystery, has been revealed 
Shall I your God hide from you what am about to do"

Abba Father is what I cry
Come by here Lord, your spirit you can't deny
When I see your wrath fixing to be poured on this earth
For this message that was scorned, my desperate cry is...

I lift my hands in surrender, laying all on the altar
I don't want to pretend, but be sealed by your hand
I will take your word and hide it in my heart
Till every fibre of my being has that desperate cry….

I've recognized your voice, I've understood the call
Help me not to faint but stand and overcome
I just want to please you, it's all I can do
So from my soul now I cry to you…"

Down inside  of me  - when I hear the word 
My heart says Amen - I ll say Amen

He has said that I will be perfect
With  the virtues of Jesus Christ Himself
But I look around, i can still see imperfections
Shown to me by the devil my enemy
Trying to get me sad and depressed
But I stand right up on my two feet 
Look at him straight in the eyes and I say:

He has said that I will be raptured 
To fly away in the sky 
And discover this other dimension
I can still feel the force of gravity
Trying to pull me down to this earth
And get me stuck in this place 
But I stand right up on my two feet 
Raise my hands challenging gravity and i say :

I'll say amen -  I'll say amen  - I'll say amen
I will be rapture -  I  say amen
Nothing wrong with  me - I say amen
It is well with my Soul - I say amen

He died for you, He died for me
He took my place and He bore my shame
That day on Calvary
The bleeding one, the Holy Son
What kind of man is this 
   would walk this road alone Jesus

It was supposed to me
Hanging from that tree
I was the one who crucified Him 
I don't deserve mercy

And when we come to eat the bread
We remember You, we remember love
We remember your amazing grace

Then I ask myself the question,
Who am I?

CHORUS
Who am I that a king would bleed and die for?
Who am I that He would pray,
 ""Not my will but thine Lord?""
The answer I may never know,
Why He ever loved me so,
But to an old rugged cross to go,
Who am I?

When I'm reminded of His Word,
'I'll leave thee never,

To deserve God's only Son
To fight my battles till they're won,

This child can face uncertain days 
Because He lives

I'll fight life's final war with pain
And then as death gives way 
   to victory
I'll see the lights of glory
And I'll know he lives"

Didn't know our Lord had rose
A man drew near and spoke,
words so wise
Broke the bread and blessed it,
Vanished and opened up our eyes

After all this life is over,
And our burdens have been lifted,
And we stand upon the mountain top so tall;
Looking over in that city,
That our Saviour is preparing,
Gives me faith, that I can make it, after all.

By myself I cannot make it,
But I know He's there to help me,
He will hear my cry, if only I will call.

Just a few more days to labour after all."

     (Lord, I receive...)
     (Jesus is here...)

Fear not, little flock,

Your shepherd selecteth 
The path you must tread;
The waters of Marah 
He'll sweeten for thee,
He drank all the bitter 
     in Gethsemane.

What ever your lot,
He enters all rooms,

Trusting, confiding in 
His great love;

And the storm clouds arise,
Obscuring the brightness of life,
I'm never alarmed 
At the overcast skies,
The Master looks on at the strife.

I know that He safely 
     will carry me through,
No matter what evils betide,
Why should I then care, 
Though the tempest may blow,
If Jesus walks close to my side.

Our Lord will return to this 
     earth some  sweet day,
Our troubles will then all be o'er.
The Master so gently 
Will lead us away,
Beyond that blest heavenly shore."

Down on my knees,

For an answer from You.

They that wait upon the Lord,
Shall renew their strength,
They shall mount up with wings 
     as eagles,
They shall run and not be weary, 
They shall walk and not faint;

Teach me, Lord, to wait.

Teach me, Lord, to wait 
While hearts are aflame,
Help me humble my pride 
And call on Your Name;
Keep my faith renewed, 
Keep my eyes on Thee,
Help me be on this earth 
What You want me to be."

Grace that will pardon 
And cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater 
Than all our sin.

Like the sea waves cold, 
Threaten the soul 
With infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, 
Yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge, 
The Mighty Cross.

Dark is the stain 
That we cannot hide,
What can avail 
To wash it away?
Look! there is flowing 
A crimson tide;
Whiter than snow 
You may be today.

Marvelous, infinite, 
Matchless grace,
Freely bestowed 
On all who believe!
You that are longing 
To see His face,
Will you this moment 
His grace receive?"

Some golden daybreak, 
Battles all won,
He'll shout the victory, 
Break through the blue,
Some golden daybreak, 
For me, for you.

Sad hearts will gladden, 
All shall be bright,
Good-bye forever 
To earth's dark night;
Changed in a moment, 
Like Him to be,

Jesus I'll see.

There in the skies,
No tears nor crying 
Shall dim our eyes;
Loved ones united 
Eternally,

That morn will be."

As I walk with the heavenly Dove;
Let me go all the while, with 
     a song and a smile,
Fill my way every day with love.

Keep me close to the side of 
     my Saviour and Guide,
Let me never in darkness rove;
Keep my path free from wrath, 
    and my soul satisfied,
Fill my way every day with love.

Soon the race will be o'er, and 
     I'll travel no more,
But abide in my home above;
Let me sing, blessed King, 
     all the way to the shore,
Fill my way every day with love."
24;I Love Him;C;"Gone from my heart the world
     and all its charms;
Now, through the blood, 
     I'm saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart 
     is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus 
     cleans white as snow.

CHORUS
I love Him, I love Him
Because He first loved me
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary's tree.

Once I was lost, and 'way 
     down deep in sin,
Once was a slave to passions 
     fierce within;
Once was afraid to 
     trust a loving God;
But now I'm cleansed from every 
     stain through Jesus' blood.

Once I was bound, 
     but now I am set free;
Once, I was blind, but now 
     the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now 
     in Christ I live,
To tell the world around 
     the peace that He doth give."
25;Zion's Hill;F;"There waits for me

CHORUS
Some day beyond the reach 
     of mortal ken,
Some day, God only knows 
Just where and when,
The wheels of mortal life 
Shall all stand still,
And I shall go to dwell 
     on Zion's hill.

Some day I'll hear the 
     angels singing,
Beyond the shadows 
     of the tomb;
And all the bells of 
     heaven ringing,
While saints are singing, 
""Home, Sweet Home.""

Some day my labors will 
     be ended,
And all my wand'rings 
     will be o'er,
And all earth's broken ties 
     be mended,
And I shall sigh and weep 
     no more.

Some day the dark clouds 
     will be rifted,
And all the night of gloom 
     be past;
And all life's burdens 
     will be lifted,
The day of rest shall 
     dawn at last."

Glory hallelujah, 
I shall not be moved;
Anchored in Jehovah, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by 
     the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In His love abiding, 
I shall not be moved;
And in Him confiding, 
I shall not be moved:
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though all hell assail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Jesus will not fail me, 
I shall not be moved;

I shall not be moved,
On the Rock of Ages, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted

Its glittering towers 
     the sun outshine,
I feel like traveling on;
That heavenly mansion 
     shall be mine,
I feel like traveling on.

Let others seek a home below,
I feel like traveling on;
Which flames devour, 
Or waves o'er flow,
I feel like traveling on.

The Lord has been so 
     good to me,
I feel like traveling on;
Until that blessed home I see,
I feel like traveling on."
583;Wings Of A Dove (P);D;"Noah had drifted
On the floods many days
He searched for land
In various ways
Troubles he had some,
But not from above,
God gave him His sign
On the wings of a dove.

CHORUS
On the wings of a snow-white dove,
God sends His pure, sweet love,
A sign from above, 
On the wings of a dove.

Jesus, our Saviour
Came to earth one day;
He was born in a stable,
In a manger of hay;
Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign,
On the wings of a dove.

Though I have suffered
In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;
Faith wasn't forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign
On the wings of a dove."
29;Beyond The Sunset;Db;"Beyond the sunset, 
Oh blissful morning,
When with our Saviour 
Heaven is begun.
Earth's toiling ended, 
Oh glorious dawning;
Beyond the sunset, 
when day is done.

Beyond the sunset 
No clouds will gather,
No storms will threaten, 
No fears annoy.
Oh day of gladness, 
Oh day unending;
Beyond the sunset, eternal joy.

Beyond the sunset, 
A hand will guide me
To God, the Father, 
Whom I adore;
His glorious presence, 
His words of welcome,
Will be my portion 
On that fair shore.

Beyond the sunset, 
Oh glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones 
Who've gone before.
In that fair homeland 
We'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset forevermore."
30;The Love Of God;C;"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

CHORUS
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints and angels song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God's love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race,
The saints and angels' song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."
31;The Meeting In The Air;A;"You have heard of little Moses in the bulrush,
You have heard of fearless David and his sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming 
     Joseph,
And of Jonah and the whale you often sing.
There are many, many others through the Bible,
I should like to meet them all, I do declare!
By and by the Lord will surely let us meet them,
At the meeting in the air.

CHORUS
There is going to be a meeting in the air.
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you, meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky;
Such singing you will hear, 
Never heard by mortal ear,
'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son will be the leading One
At the meeting in the air.

Many things will there be missing 
In that meeting:
For the mourners bench 
Will have no place at all;
There will never be a sermon 
Preached to sinners,
For the sinner had refused to heed the call.
There will be no mourning 
Over wayward loved ones,
There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer;
All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted
At that meeting in the air.

There the doubters will be missing altogether,
All the skeptics will be absent on that day;
There will be no grumblers present to disturb us,
And the Achans will be busy far away.
There the saints will have His 
     ""seal upon their foreheads,""
Dressed in raiment none 
But ransomed ones can wear;
All who have the wedding garments 
     will be present, 
At the meeting in the air."
32;The Old Time Religion;G;"It's the old-time Holy Spirit,
And the devil won't go near It,
That's the reason people fear It;
But it's good enough for me.

CHORUS
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
It's good enough for me.

It will make you stop your lying;
It will save you when you're dying;
It will start the devil flying;
And It's good enough for me.

It's so good I want no other,
For It makes me love my brother;
And It brings things from under 
     cover,
And It's good enough for me."
33;Jesus, The Light;Eb;"All ye saints of light proclaim,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Life and mercy in His name,
Jesus, the light of the world.

CHORUS
We'll walk in the light, 
    the beautiful light,
Come where the dewdrops 
    of mercy are bright;
Shine all around us 
    by day and by night,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Hear the Saviour's earnest call,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Send the Gospel truth to all,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Why not seek Him then today,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Go with truth the narrow way,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Come, confess Him as your King, 
Jesus, the light of the world;
Then the bells of heaven will ring,
Jesus, the light of the world."
34;It's Dripping With Blood;Eb;"The first one to die for 
This Holy Ghost plan,
Was John the Baptist, 
But he died like a man;
Then came the Lord Jesus, 
They crucified Him,
He taught that the Spirit 
Would save men from sin.

CHORUS
It's dripping with blood, Yes, 
It's dripping with blood,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood,
The blood of disciples 
Who died for the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, 
And John the divine,
They gave up their lives so 
This Gospel could shine;
They mingled their blood, 
Like the prophets of old,
So the true Word of God 
Could honest be told.

Then they stoned Stephen, 
He preached against sin,
He made them so angry, 
They dashed his head in;
But he died in the Spirit, 
And gave up the ghost,
And went to join others, 
In that life-giving host.

There's souls under the altar, 
Crying, ""How long?""
For the Lord to punish 
Those who've done wrong;
But there's going to be more 
Who'll give their life's blood
For this Holy Ghost Gospel 
And its crimson flood."
35;Have Thine Own Way, Lord;F;"Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Thou are the Potter;
I am the clay.
Mold me and make me
After Thy will,
While I am waiting, 
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me,

Absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me."
36;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot;F;"I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home;
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

CHORUS
Swing low, sweet chariot, 
Coming for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do,
Coming for to carry me home;
Tell all my friends I'm a-coming too,
Coming for to carry me home."
37;Peace In The Valley;C;"Well, I'm tired and so weary, 
But I must go along;
Till the Lord comes and calls 
Me away, oh, yes;
Well the morning is bright 
And the Lamb is the Light;
And the night, night is as fair 
As the day, oh yes.

CHORUS
There will be peace in the valley 
For me some day;
There will be peace in the valley 
For me, oh, Lord, I pray;
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow,
     no trouble I'll see;
There will be peace 
In the valley for me.

There the flow'rs will be blooming, 
And the grass will be green;
And the skies will be clear 
And serene, oh, yes;
Well the sun ever beams, 
In this valley of dreams;
And no clouds there will ever 
Be seen,oh, yes.

Well, the bear will be gentle, 
And the wolf will be tame;
And the lion shall lay down 
By the lamb, oh, yes;
Well the beast from the wild, 
Shall be led by a little child;
And I'll be changed, changed 
From this creature that I am, oh, yes."
38;Battle Hymn Of The Republic;Bb;"Mine eyes have seen the glory
     of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
     of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
     of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
     in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
     by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
     that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
     before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
     be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
     Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
     that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
     let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on."
39;Hold To God's Hand;F;"Time is filled with swift transition,
Naught of earth unmoved can stand,
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging hand!

CHORUS
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging hand!

Trust in Him who will not leave you,
Whatsoever years may bring,
If by earthly friends forsaken,
Still more closely to Him cling!

Covet not this world's vain riches,
That so rapidly decay,
Seek to gain the heavenly treasures,
They will never pass away!

When your journey is completed,
If to God you have been true,
Fair and bright the home in glory,
Your enraptured soul will view!"
40;One Day;C;"One day when heaven 
Was filled with His praises,
One day when sin 
Was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth 
To be born of a virgin -
Dwelt amongst men, 
My example is He!

CHORUS
Living, He loved me; 
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried 
My sins far away;
Rising, He justified 
Freely forever:
One day He's coming - 
Oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him 
Up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him 
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, 
Despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins, 
My Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him 
Alone in the garden,
One day He rested, 
From suffering free;
Angels came down 
O'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, 
My Saviour is He!

One day the grave could 
Conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled 
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death 
He had conquered;
Now is ascended, 
My Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will 
Sound for His coming,
One day the skies with 
His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, 
My beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour, 
This Jesus is mine!"
41;Down From His Glory;Eb;"Down from His glory, 
Ever living story,
My God and Saviour came, 
And Jesus was His Name.
Born in a manger, 
To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, 
Tears and agony.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Him!  
How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, 
My all in all!
The great Creator 
Became my Saviour,
And all God's fullness 
Dwelleth in Him.

What condescension, 
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night, 
Not one faint hope in sight;
God, gracious, tender, 
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, 
To save my soul.

Without reluctance, 
Flesh and blood His substance,
He took the form of man, 
Revealed the hidden plan.
Oh glorious mystery, 
Sacrifice of Calvary,
And now I know 
Thou art  the great ""I Am."""
42;Bound For The Promised Land;Eb;"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye,
Toward Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

CHORUS
I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns,
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds, nor pois'nous breath,
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
Are feared and felt no more.

When shall I reach that happy place, 
And be forever blest!
When shall I see my Father's face,
And in His bosom rest?"
43;How Great Thou Art;A / Bb;"Oh Lord my God!  
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds 
Thy hands have made;
I see the stars, 
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy pow'r throughout 
The universe displayed.

CHORUS
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great
    Thou art!"
44;Leave It There;F;"If the world from you withholds 
Of its silver and its gold,
And you have to get along 
With meager fare,
Just remember, in His Word, 
How He feeds the little bird;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

CHORUS
Leave it there, leave it there,
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there;
If you trust and never doubt,
He will surely bring you out;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

If your body suffers pain 
And your health you can't regain,
And your soul is 
Almost sinking in despair,
Jesus knows the pain you feel,
He can save and He can heal;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your enemies assail
And your heart begins to fail,
Don't forget that God 
In heaven answers prayer;
He will make a way for you 
And will lead you safely through;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your youthful days are gone
And old age is stealing on,
And your body bends 
Beneath the weight of care;
He will never leave you then,
He'll go with you to the end;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there."
45;What A Day That Will Be;F;"There is coming a day 
When no heartaches shall come,
No more clouds in the sky, 
No more tears to dim the eye;
All is peace forevermore 
On that happy golden shore,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

CHORUS
What a day that will be
When my Jesus I shall see,
When I look upon His face, 
The One who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand,
And leads me through 
The Promised Land,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

There'll be no sorrow there, 
No more burdens to bear,
No more sickness, no pain, 
No more parting over there;
And forever I will be 
With the One who died for me,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be."
46;He Abides;F;"I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the pilgrim way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see,
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, He abides,
Hallelujah, He abides with me
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care
I'm as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me!

There's no thirsting for the things
Of the world, they've taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter abides with me!"
47;Then Jesus Came;C;"One sat alone beside the 
    highway begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he 
    could not see;
He clutched his rags and shivered 
    in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and bade his 
    darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the tempter's 
    power is broken;
When Jesus comes, the tears 
    are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the 
    life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus 
    comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil 
    spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
He cut himself as demon pow'rs 
    possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the 
    captive free.

Unclean! unclean! The leper cried 
    in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness 
    stood near;
The fever raged, disease had gripped 
    its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast 
    out every fear.

So men today have found the 
    Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion, 
    lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them sad 
    and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt 
    Himself within."
584;The Day Of Redemption (PBW);F;"Nations are breaking, 
Israel's awaking,
The signs that the prophets 
     foretold;
The Gentile days numbered, 
With horrors encumbered;
Eternity soon will unfold.

CHORUS
The day of redemption is here,
Men's hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Your lamps trimmed and clear,
Look up! Your redemption is here.

The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem's restoring
Her national life, long dethroned;
Today she is calling, 
Her latter rain's falling,
""Return, Oh dispersed, to your own.""

Heaven's powers are shaking, 
And many are mistaking
God's meaning to be of the sky;
God's Church is the power
That's shaking this hour:
The day of redemption is nigh.

False prophets are lying, 
God's Truth they're denying,
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generation 
Spurns God's revelation,
We'll walk where the apostles 
     have trod."
49;Come And Go With Me;F;"Come and go with me
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House.
Come and go with me,
To my Father's House,
Where there's peace,
peace, peace.

Jesus will be there
In my Father's House
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House.
Jesus will be there
In my Father's House,
Where there's peace,
peace, peace.

There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House, 
In my Father's House.
There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House.
There'll be joy, real joy."
50;I'll Fly Away;G;"Some glad morning 
When this life is o'er
I'll fly away,
To a home on God's 
     celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away, oh glory, 
I'll fly away;
By and by, 
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows 
Of this life have grown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird from prison 
     bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more 
Weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys 
     shall never end,
I'll fly away."
51;My Sins Are Gone;Eb;"You ask me why I'm happy
So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;
And when I meet the scoffers
Who ask me where they are,
I say, my sins are gone.

CHORUS
They're underneath the Blood,
Of the Cross of Calvary,
As far removed as darkness 
     is from dawn;
In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
That's good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me 
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

I'm living now for Jesus,
I'm happy night and day,
Because my sins are gone;
My soul is filled with music,
With all my heart I say,
I know my sins are gone."
52;The Great Emancipator;G;"Once my heart and soul were fettered
By the binding chains of sin.
But the Great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Blessed be His holy name!
He's the Great Emancipator,
That's the song of the Redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting
Oh so helpless and alone, 
But the seeking Shepherd found me,
Led me to my Father's home."
53;Till We Meet;Bb;"God be with you 'til we meet again!
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!

CHORUS
Till we meet! 'Til we meet!
Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
Till we meet! 'Til we meet!
God be with you 'til we meet again!

God be with you 'til we meet again!
'Neath His wings securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!

God be with you 'til we meet again!
When life's perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you;

God be with you 'til we meet again!
Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
Smite death's threat'ning wave 
     before you;

54;More About Jesus;F;"More about Jesus I would know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

CHORUS
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus in His Word, 
Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace."
55;Psalm 19;F;"The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure,
Making wise the simple.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The statutes of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure,
Enlightening the eyes.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.
And in the keeping of them
There is great reward,
There is great reward.
In the keeping of them
There is great reward."
56;His Banner Over Me Is Love;F;"He  brought me to His banqueting table
His banner over me is love;
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

He set straight paths before my feet
His banner over me is love,
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

He broke the chains and He set me free
His banner over me is love
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

I am my Beloved's and He is mine
His banner over me is love,

His banner over me is love."
57;We Are Heirs;F;"We are heirs of the Father
We are joint-heirs with the Son.
We are people of His Kingdom
We are family, we are one.

We are washed,
We are sanctified.
We are cleansed by His blood.
We are born of the Spirit
We are children of the Lord.

We are members of His body.
We are objects of His love.
We're partakers of His holiness
We are citizens of heaven above.

We're partakers of His suffering;
We're partakers of His grace.
We shall meet Him to be like Him
We shall see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming
We are looking to the skies;
We are watching, we are waiting,
We shall dwell with Him, we shall rise.

We shall reign with Him forever;
Men and angels shout and sing.
For dominion has been given
To the family of the King."
58;He Touched Me;D / E;"Shackled by a heavy burden
'Neath a load of guilt and shame,
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same.

CHORUS
He touched me,
Oh, He touched me,
And oh, the joy 
That floods my soul!
Something happened, 
And now I know,
He touched me, 
And made me whole.

Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed 
And made me whole,
I shall never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls."
59;It Is Well With My Soul;C;"When peace like a river
Attendeth my way,
When sorrows, 
Like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, 
Thou hast taught me to say,
""It is well, it is well with my soul.""

CHORUS
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well 
With my soul.

Tho' Satan should buffet,
Tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control.
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood
     for my soul.

My sin - oh, the bliss 
Of this glorious thought -
My sin - not in part, 
But the whole
Is nailed to the cross;
And I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Oh my soul.

And Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight.
The clouds be rolled back 
     as a scroll.
The trump shall resound, 
And the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee,
For Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, 
     is our goal;
Oh, the shout of the angel!
Oh, the voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope!
Blessed rest of my soul!"
60;Thank God I Am Free;G;"For a long time I travelled
Down a long lonely road;
My heart was so heavy in sin I sank low.
Then I heard about Jesus,
What a wonderful hour;
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out
Through His saving power.

CHORUS
Thank God I am free, free, free
From this world of sin.
Been washed in the blood of Jesus,
I've been born again.
Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved
By His wonderful grace.
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out 
And show me the way.

Like a bird out of prison
That's taken its flight;
Like a blind man that God 
Gave back  his sight.
Like a poor wretched beggar
That's found fortune and fame,
I'm so glad that I found out 
He could bring me out
Thro' His Holy name."
61;He Paid A Debt;D;"He paid a debt He did not owe,
I owed a debt I could not pay,
I needed someone to wash 
     my sins away;
And now I sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay.

He paid a debt at Calvary,
He cleansed my soul and 
     set me free,
I'm glad that Jesus did all 
     my sins erase.
I now can sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay.

One day He's coming back for me,
To live with Him eternally,
Won't it be glorious to see Him 
     on that day!
I then will sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay."
62;This Is Like Heaven To Me;F;"We find many people 
Who can't understand
Why we are so happy and free,
We've crossed over Jordan 
To Canaan's fair land,
And this is like heaven to me.

CHORUS
Oh this is like heaven to me,
Yes, this is like heaven to me.
I've crossed over Jordan 
To Canaan's fair land,
And this is like heaven to me.

So when we are happy 
We sing and we shout,
Some don't understand us, you see;
We're filled with the Spirit, 
There is not a doubt,
And this is like heaven to me.

We've heard the sweet music, 
The heavenly chord
From glory land over the sea;
A soul-thrilling message 
From Jesus our Lord,
And this is like heaven to me."
63;I'm In That Number;G;"I'm in that number, I'm in that number,

That blood-washed number,
I'm in that number robed in white;

70;I Love to Tell The Story;G;"I love to tell the story 
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory, 
Of Jesus and His Love,
I love to tell the story,
Because I know 'tis true,
It satisfies my longings, 
As nothing else can do.

Chorus
I love to tell the story!  
'Twill be my theme in glory
To tell the old, old story  
Of Jesus and His love.

I love to tell the story;  
More wonderful it seems 
Than all the golden fancies  
Of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story, 
It did so much for me;
And that is just the reason 
I tell it now to thee

I love to tell the story; 
'Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems each time I tell it,  
More wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story;
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God's own holy word.

I love to tell the story;
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,  
I sing the new, new song,
'Twill be the old, old story, 
That I have loved so long."
71;We're Marching To Zion;F;"Come, we that love the Lord,

Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Who never knew our God:
But children of the heav'nly King,
But children of the heav'nly King,
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound,
And ev'ry tear be dry;
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground,
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground,
To fairer worlds on high,

Showers of blessing, 
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,  
But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing  
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,  
Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of blessing.  
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,  
Come, and now honor Thy Word.

There shall be showers of blessing.  
Oh that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing, 
Now as on Jesus we call!"

Come for a cleansing 
    to Calvary's tide;
There's wonderful pow'r 
     in the blood.

Would you be whiter, 
    much whiter than snow?
There's pow'r in the blood, 
    pow'r in the blood;
Sin-stains are lost 
    in its life-giving flow;
There's wonderful pow'r 
     in the blood.

Would you do service 
    for Jesus your King?
There's pow'r in the blood,

74;One Of Them;F;"There are people almost everywhere,
Whose hearts are all aflame,
With the fire that fell at Pentecost,
Which cleansed and made them clean;

I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

CHORUS
One of them, one of them,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!
One of them, one of them,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

Though these people may not 
      learned be,
Nor boast of worldly fame,
They have all received their Pentecost,
Baptized in Jesus' name;
And are telling now, both far and wide,
His pow'r is yet the same,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

They were gathered in the upper room,
All praying in His name,
They were baptized with the 
     Holy Ghost,
And pow'r for service came;
Now what He did for them that day
He'll do for you the same;
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

Come, my brother, seek this blessing
That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy-bells ringing
And will keep the soul aflame;
It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His name,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!"
75;The Solid Rock;F;"My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

CHORUS
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne."
76;Beulah Land Sweet Beulah Land;F;"I've reached the land of corn and wine, 
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.

Chorus
Oh Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.
As on Thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory-shore,
My heav'n, my home forevermore!

My Savior comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by the hand, 
For this is heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from eververnal trees,
And flow'rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody.
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song."
77;The Haven Of Rest;F;"My soul in sad exile 
Was out on life's sea,
So burdened with sin 
     and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice 
Saying, ""Make me your choice;""
And I entered the Haven of Rest.

CHORUS
I've anchored my soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
I'll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep 
O'er the wild, stormy deep;
In Jesus I'm safe evermore.

I yielded myself 
To his tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, 
And I anchored my soul;
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, 
Since the Lord made me whole,    
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus who'll save 
Whosoever will have
A home in the Haven of Rest.

How precious the thought 
That we all may recline,
Like John the beloved and blest,
On Jesus' strong arm 
Where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the Haven of Rest.

Oh come to the Savior, 
He patiently waits,
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
And say, ""My Beloved is mine."""
78;There Is A Fountain Filled With Blood;Bb;"There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God
Are saved, to sin no more,
Are saved, to sin no more,
Are saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God
Are saved, to sin no more.

For since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave."

Standing, standing, 
Standing on the promises 
Of God, my Savior;
Standing, standing,

The promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
That cannot fail,
When the howling storms 
Of doubt and fear assail,
By the living Word of God 
I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I now can see
Perfect, present cleansing 
In the blood for me;
Standing in the liberty 
Where Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
Of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally 
By love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily 
With the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I cannot fall,
Listening every moment 
To the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Savior 
As my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God."
80;Praise The Lord;G;"To God be the glory,

An atonement for sin,
And opened the Life Gate 
That all may go in.

CHORUS

Let the earth hear His voice;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, 
Through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; 
Great things He hath done.

Oh, perfect redemption, 
The purchase of blood,
To every believer 
The promise of God;
The vilest offender 
Who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus 
A pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing 
Through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, 
And greater will be
Our wonder, our transport 
When Jesus we see."

You are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged, 
Thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you 
What the Lord hath done.

CHORUS
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Count your blessings,
See what God hath done;
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
And it will surprise you 
What the Lord hath done.

Are you ever burdened 
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing 
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised 
You His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings, 
Money cannot buy
Your reward in Heaven, 
Nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict, 
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, 
God is over all;
Count your many blessings, 
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you 
To your journey's end."
82;What A Friend;F;"What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there."
83;Trust And Obey;F;"When we walk with the Lord
In the Light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

CHORUS
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey."
84;Higher Ground;Ab;"I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as I'm onward bound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

CHORUS
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on Heaven's table land,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell 
Where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till heaven I've found,
Lord, lead me on to higher ground."
85;Rock Of Ages;G;"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee."
86;Close To Thee;F;"Thou, my everlasting portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior let me walk with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior let me walk with Thee.

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Nor for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me through the vale of shadows,
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee."
87;Cleanse Me;F;"Search me, Oh God, 
And know my heart today;
Try me, Oh Savior, 
Know my thoughts, I pray:
See if there be some wicked 
     way in me:
Cleanse me from every sin, 
     and set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing 
     me from sin:
Fulfill Thy Word, and make me 
     pure within:
Fill me with fire where once 
I burned with shame:
Grant my desire to magnify 
     Thy name.

Lord take my life, and make it 
     wholly Thine:
Fill my poor heart with 
Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, 
     self and pride;
I now surrender: Lord in me abide.

Oh, Holy Ghost, revival comes 
     from Thee:
Send a revival, 
Start the work in me:
Thy Word declares, 
Thou wilt supply our need:
For blessing now, Oh Lord, 
     I humbly plead."
88;We'll Understand It Better By And By;F;"We are often tossed and driven
On the restless sea of time,
Somber skies and howling tempests
Oft succeed a bright sunshine,
In that land of perfect day,
When the mists have rolled away,
We will understand it better by and by.

CHORUS
By and by when the morning comes,
When the saints of God are gathered home,
We will tell the story how we've overcome;
For we'll understand it better by and by.

We are often destitute
Of the things that life demands,
Want of food, want of shelter,
Thirsty hills and barren lands,
We are trusting in the Lord,
And according to His Word,
We will understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares
Often take us unawares,
And our hearts are made to bleed
For many thoughtless word or deed,
And we wonder why the test
When we try to do our best,
But we'll understand it better by and by."

Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night."

How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
Oh, for grace to trust Him more!

Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
Just in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood.

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.

I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee!
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end."

Whispers of love.

Perfect submission, 
All is at rest!
I, in my Savior, 
Am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, 
Looking above,
Filled with His goodness, 
Lost in His love."
93;I Am Thine, Oh Lord;F;"I am Thine, oh Lord, 
    I have heard Thy voice;
And it told Thy love to me.
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

CHORUS
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, 
     nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now, 
    to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up 
    with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour,
That before Thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer, 
    and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love 
    that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy 
    that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee."
94;Pass Me Not;F;"Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Chorus
Savior, Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Let me at a throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit, 
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heav'n but Thee?"
95;When We All Get To Heaven;C;"Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace;
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He'll prepare for us a place.

CHORUS
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will over-spread the sky;
But when trav'ling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev'ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold."
96;When The Roll Is Called Up Yonder;F;"When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound
And time shall be no more,
And the morning breaks eternal,
Bright and fair;
When the saved of earth shall gather
Over on the other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.

CHORUS
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.

On that bright and cloudless morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.

Let us labor for the Master 
From the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous 
Love and care;
Then when all of life is over, 
And our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there."

I am the LORD that healeth thee;
Sickness must flee at My command:
For I am the LORD that healeth thee.

I am the LORD that healeth thee,
I am the LORD that healeth thee;
The prayer of faith shall banish disease:
For I am the LORD that healeth thee.

I am the LORD that healeth thee,
I am the LORD that healeth thee;
My name is still as ointment poured forth:
For I am the LORD that healeth thee.

I am the LORD that healeth thee,
I am the LORD that healeth thee;
Come and be free from all your pains:
For I am the LORD that healeth thee."
98;Old-Time Power;F;"They were in an upper chamber,
They were all with one accord,
When the Holy Ghost descended,
As was promised by our Lord.

Chorus
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
And baptize ev'ry one.

Yes, this pow'r from heav'n descended,
With the sound of rushing wind;
Tongues of fire came down upon them,
As the Lord said He would send.

Yes, this ""old-time"" pow'r was given 
To our fathers who were true;
This is promised to believers,
And we all may have it, too."
99;Are You Washed in the Blood?;G;"Have you been to Jesus 
     for the cleansing pow'r?
Are you washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting 
     in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb?

CHORUS
Are you washed in the blood,
In the soul-cleansing blood 
     of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless?
Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb?

Are you walking daily 
     by the Savior's side?
Are you washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb?
Do you rest each 
     moment in the Crucified?
Are you washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb?

When the Bridegroom cometh
     will your robes be white?
Are you washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready 
     for the mansions bright,
And be washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb?

Lay aside the garments 
     that are stained with sin,
Are you washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb?
There's a fountain flowing 
     for the soul unclean,
Oh be washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb.

Yes, I'm washed in the blood
In the soul-cleansing blood 
     of the Lamb.
Yes, my garments are spotless,
     they are white as snow.
Yes, I'm washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb."
100;The Lily Of The Valley;Eb;"I have found a friend in Jesus, 
He's everything to me, 
He's the Fairest of 
Ten thousand to my soul;
The Lily of the Valley in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse 
And make me fully whole.
In sorrow He's my comfort, 
In trouble He's my stay
He tells me every care 
On Him to roll.

CHORUS
He's the Lily of the Valley, 
The bright and morning star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand 
     to my soul.

He all my grief has taken, 
And all my sorrows borne;
In temptation He's my 
Strong and mighty tower;
I have all for Him forsaken, 
And all my idols torn from my heart, 
And now He keeps me by His power.
Though all the world forsake me, 
And Satan tempts me sore,
Through Jesus I shall 
Safely reach the goal;

He will never, never leave me, 
Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith 
And do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, 
I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He 
My hungry soul shall fill.
Then sweeping up to glory, 
To see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll!"
101;Onward, Christian Solders;Eb;"Onward, Christian soldiers! 
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before,
Christ, the royal Master, 
Leads against the foe,
Forward into battle, 
See His banners go!

CHORUS
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.

Like a mighty army 
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading 
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided, 
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never 
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, 
Which can never fail.

Onward, then ye people! 
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honor, 
Unto Christ the King;
This thro' countless ages 
Men and angels sing."
102;Near The Cross;F;"Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

CHORUS
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."

From the curse to set me free.

CHORUS
Sing, oh, sing, of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell

I will sing of my  Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be."

Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Oh, how sweet to walk 
In this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
Oh, how bright the path 
Grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

What have I to dread, 
What have I to fear,
Leaning on the everlasting arms?
I have blessed peace 
With my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms."
106;Amazing Grace;G;"Amazing grace! 
     How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, 
     but now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught 
     my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did 
      that grace appear
The hour I first believed;

Thro' many dangers, 
      toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought 
      me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

When we've been 
      there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days 
      to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

Praise God, Praise God
    Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Praise God, 
    Praise God.
Praise God, Praise God
    Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Praise God,
    Praise God.

Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen.
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen.

The Lord has promised 
    good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my shield 
    and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh 
    and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, 
    within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The world shall 
     soon to ruin go,
The sun refuse to shine;
But God, who called 
     me here below,
Shall be forever mine."

I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
And go with me, with me all the way."
108;I Know Whom I Have Believed (PBW);D;"I know not why 
God's wondrous grace
To me He hath 
made known,
Nor why, unworthy, 
Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

CHORUS
But I know whom 
I have believed,
And am persuaded 
  that He is able
To keep that which 
I've committed
Unto Him against 
  that day.

I know not how 
  this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing
  in His Word
Wrought peace 
  within my heart.

I know not how 
  the Spirit moves,
Convincing men 
  of sin,
Revealing Jesus 
  thro' the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what 
  of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or 
golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air."
109;Sweet By And By;F;"There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

CHORUS
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days."
110;When I Survey;C;"When I survey the wondrous cross,
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all."
111;The Great Physician;Eb;"The great Physician now is near;
The sympathizing Jesus.
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus.

CHORUS
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

Your many sins are all forgiv'n,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to heav'n,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Savior's name,
I love the name of Jesus.

And when to that bright world above
We rise to be with Jesus,
We'll sing around the throne of love,
His name, the name of Jesus."

On Thee, my Savior and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

CHORUS
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away.

'Tis done, the great transaction's done;
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;
He drew me, and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

Now rest, my long-divided heart;
Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
Nor ever from my Lord depart,
With Him of every good posessed."
113;Take The Name Of Jesus With You;G;"Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it, then, where'er you go.

CHORUS
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

Take the name of Jesus with you,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

Oh the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him
When our journey is complete."
114;Blest Be The Tie That Binds;F;"Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, 
    our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again."
115;Sweet Hour Of Prayer;D;"Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear,
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
I view my home, and take my flight:
This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing thro' the air,
Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"
116;When They Ring The Golden Bells;Eb;"There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore 
By faith's decree;
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

CHORUS
Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee.
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

We shall know no sin nor sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond
    the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
When in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the spirit
    to be free
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Aiden,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me."
117;Just As I Am;C;"Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

Just as I am, and waiting not,
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee whose blood can cleanse
     each spot,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

Just as I am, tho' tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!"

In His presence daily live.

Humbly at His feet I bow;
Worldly pleasure all forsaken,
Take me Jesus, take me now.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred flame;
Oh the joy of full salvation,
Glory, glory to His name."
119;My Jesus, I Love Thee;F;"My Jesus, I love Thee, I

For Thee all the follies
    of sin I resign;
My gracious Redeemer,
    my Savior art Thou;
If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, 'tis now.

I love Thee, because Thou
    hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon
    on Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing
    the thorns on Thy brow:
If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, 'tis now.

I'll love Thee in life,
    I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou
    lendest me breath;
And say when the death dew
    lies cold on my brow,
If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, 'tis now.

In mansions of glory and
    endless delight,
I'll ever adore Thee in
    heaven so bright;
I'll sing with the glittering
    crown on my brow,
If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, 'tis now."

So closely knitted into one,
They've taken me into their heart,
And I'm so glad to be a part,
Of this great family."
121;He Washed My Eyes With Tears;F;"He washed my eyes with tears that I might see
The broken heart I had was good for me;
He tore it all apart and looked inside,
He found it full of fear and foolish pride.
He swept away the things that made me blind,
And then I saw the clouds were silver lined;
And now I understand 'twas best for me,
He washed my eyes with tears that I might see.

He washed my eyes with tears that I might see
The glory of Himself revealed to me;
I did not know that He had wounded hands,
I saw the blood He spilt upon the sands.
I saw the marks of shame and wept and cried,
He was my substitute, for me He died;
And now I'm glad He came so tenderly,
And washed my eyes with tears that I might see."
122;Jesus Use Me;G;"Dear Lord I'll be a witness
If you will help my weakness,
I know that I'm not worthy
  Lord of thee;
By eyes of faith I see thee,
Upon the cross of Calvary,
Dear Lord I cry,
  Let me thy servant be.

Chorus
Jesus use me,
O Lord don't refuse me,
For surely there's a work that 
  I can do;
And even tho it's humble,
Help my will to crumble,
Tho the cost be great,
I'll work for You

I'll stand for thee dear Jesus,
'Tho death may come my way,
I'll spread the gospel
  to the fallen here;
But if it be thy will Lord,
To go across the sea,
Lord help me to be
  willing to say yes.

He's the Lily of the Valley,
The Bright and Morning Star,
He's the Fairest of Ten
  Thousand to My Soul;
He's the Beautiful
Rose of Sharon,
He's all the world to me,
But best of all,
He is my coming King."
161;In Everything Give Him Thanks;G;"In everything give Him thanks, 
Give Him thanks;

Jesus keep me from all wrong;
I'll be satisfied as long,
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

CHORUS
Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea;
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Thru this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

When my feeble life is o'er,

163;The Old Rugged Cross;Ab;"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suff'ring and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

CHORUS
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown.

Oh, that old rugged cross so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me someday to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share."
399;When We See Christ;D;"It will be worth it all, when we see Jesus;

164;Love Lifted Me;A;"I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within, 
Sinking to rise no more;
But the Master of the sea
Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
Now safe am I.

When nothing else could help, 
Love lifted me.
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
Love lifted me.

All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I'll cling,
In His blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing.
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul's best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belongs.

Souls in danger, look above,

Out of the angry waves.

Billows His will obey;

Be saved today."

165;Oh I Want To See Him;G;"As I journey thru the land 
  singing as I go,
Pointing souls to Calvary 
 to the crimson flow.
Many arrows pierce my soul 
  from without, within;
But my Lord leads me on, 
Thru' Him I must win.

CHORUS
O I want to see Him, look upon His face,
There to sing forever of His saving grace;
On the streets of Glory let me lift my voice;
Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.

When in service for my Lord 
  dark may be the night,
But I'll cling more close to Him, 
  He will give me light;
Satan's snares may vex my soul, 
  turn my tho'ts aside;
But my Lord goes ahead,
  leads whate'er betide.

When in valleys low I look 
  tow'rd the mountain height,
And behold my Savior there,
  leading in the fight. 
With a tender hand outstretched 
  tow'rd the valley low,
Guiding me, I can see, 
  as I onward go.

When before me billows rise 
  from the mighty deep,
Then my Lord directs my bark; 
  He doth safely keep,
And He leads me gently on 
  thru' this world below;
He's a real Friend to me, 
O I love Him so."
166;Since Jesus Came Into My Heart;G;"What a wonderful change in my life

  and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins which were many are 
  all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I'm possessed of a hope that is 
  steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And no dark clouds of doubt now 
  my pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

There's a light in the valley of death now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And the gates of the city beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I shall go there to dwell in that city I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I'm happy, so happy, as onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart."

There's no other friend so kind as he;
No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,
O how much He cared for me.

And it dries all my tears.
The blood that gives me strength from 
  day to day,

And I know it makes me so much more than I did then.

Chorus

Love with Him,
Over and over and over
And over again,
I keep falling in love
With Him, over and over
And over and over again
He gets sweeter and sweeter
As the days go by,
Oh what a love between my
Lord and I 
Just keep falling in love
With Him, over and over and over and over again

There's a Hand that I hold on to,
Thru each valley and each trial,
There's a shoulder that I lean upon
As I face another mile.
There's a love that I can depend on
It's fresh and new each day,
And with love my heart is over flowing
That is why I say."
133;Remind Me, Dear Lord;Eb;"The things that I love

Roll back the curtain of memory now and then;
Show me where you brought me from and 
  where I could have been;
Remember I'm human and humans forget;
So remind me, remind me, dear Lord.

Nothing good have I done
To deserve God's own son;
I'm not worthy of the scars in His hands
Yet He chose the road to Calvary,
To die in my stead;
Why He loved me,
I can't understand."

   caught my falling soul
He looked beyond my faults and saw 
   my need

Amazing grace that saved me from
   that sin and shame
To draw me close and keep me
   by His side
Forever I'll sing of Grace
   of glory to His Name
If not for Him
I surely would have died.

How sweet it is to walk 
   with Him this narrow way
For now I see the light, 
   the glory gleam
Soon I shall see His lovely face 
   and He will say
Well done my child, 
   come be enthroned with me"
157;The Lighthouse;D;"There's a lighthouse on the hillside
That overlooks life's sea,
When I'm tossed it sends out a light,
That I might see;
And the light that shines in darkness,
Now will safely lead us o'er,
If it wasn't for the lighthouse,
My ship would be no more.

CHORUS
And I thank God for the lighthouse,
I owe my life to Him,
For Jesus is the Lighthouse,
And from the rocks of sin;
He has shone a light around me,
That I could clearly see,
If it wasn't for the lighthouse,
Tell me, where would this ship be?

Everybody that lives about us
Says, tear that lighthouse down,
The big ships don't sail this way anymore,
There's no use of it standing 'round;
Then my mind goes back to that stormy night,
When just in time I saw the light,
Yes, the light from that old lighthouse
That stands up there on the hill."
395;You Are The Words To The Music;C;"You are the words to the music,
You are the song that I sing.
You are the melody,
You are the harmony,
Praise to your name I will sing.
You are the mighty God,
You are the Lord of Lords,
You are the King of all Kings;
Now I return to you the song that you gave to me,
You are the song that I sing."
158;Remember Me, Almighty One;G;"Remember me.

396;Sometimes Hallelujah;C;"Sometimes hallelujah,
Sometimes praise the Lord
Sometimes gently singing,
Our hearts in one accord."
159;He Giveth More Grace;Eb;"He giveth more grace
When the burdens grow greater;
He sendeth more strength
When the labors increase.
To added affliction He addeth His mercy;
To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace

His love has no limit;
His grace has no measure;
His power has no boundary known unto men.
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,
He giveth and giveth and giveth again.

When we have exhausted
Our store of endurance,
When our strength has failed;
Ere the day is half done,
When we reach the end of our hoarded resources,
Our Father's full giving is only begun."
160;Sweet Beulah Land;F;"I'm kind of homesick for a country
To which I've never been before.
No sad goodbyes will there be spoken
For time won't matter anymore.

CHORUS
Beulah Land, I'm longing for you.
And someday, on Thee I'll stand;
There my home shall be eternal.
Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.

I'm looking now across the river
Where my faith will end in sight.
There's just a few more days to labor
Then I will take my heavenly flight."
397;We'll Work Till Jesus Comes;F;"We'll work till Jesus comes.
We'll work till Jesus comes.
We'll work till Jesus comes,
And we'll be gathered home!"
398;The More That I Surrender;F;"The more that I surrender
The lighter my load
The more that I release my cares,
The more You take control.
The more that I can humble myself,
The more You lift me up.
Everyday I live,
Lord, I love You more."
167;I Know Who Holds Tomorrow;Bb;"I don't know about tomorrow,
I just live from day to day.
I don't borrow from its sunshine,
For its skies may turn to gray.
I don't worry o'er the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
And today I'll walk beside Him,
For He knows what is ahead.

CHORUS
Many things about tomorrow.
I don't seem to understand;
But I know who holds tomorrow,
And I know who holds my hand.

Ev'ry step is getting brighter,
As the golden stairs I climb;
Ev'ry burden's getting lighter;
Ev'ry cloud is silver lined.
There the sun is always shining.
There no tear will dim the eye,
At the ending of the rainbow,
Where the mountains touch the sky.

I don't know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty;
But the one who feeds the sparrow, 
Is the one who stands by me.
And the path that be my portion,
May be through the flame or flood,
But His presence goes before me,
And I'm covered with His blood."
168;We'll Talk It Over;F;"Tho' shadows deepen and my heart bleeds
I will not question the way He leads;
This side of heaven we know in part,
I will not question a broken heart.

CHORUS
We'll talk it over in the bye and bye,
We'll talk it over, my Lord and I,
I'll ask the reasons He'll tell me why,
When we talk it over in the bye and bye.

I'll trust His leading, He'll never fail,
Thro' darkest tunnels or misty vale;
Obey His bidding and faithful be,
Tho' only one step ahead I see.

I'll hide my heartache behind a smile
And wait for reasons till after while;
And 'tho He try me I know I'll find,
That all my burdens are silver lined."
169;Room At The Cross For You;G;"The cross upon which Jesus died
Is a shelter in which we can hide,
And its grace so free is sufficient for me,
And deep is its fountain; as wide as the sea.

CHORUS
There's room at the cross for you.
There's room at the cross for you.
Tho millions have come
There's still room for one
Yes, there's room at the cross for you.

The millions have found Him a friend
And have turn'd from the sins they have sinned
The Saviour still waits to open the gates,
And welcome a sinner before it's too late.

The hand of my Saviour is strong
And the love of my Saviour is long.
Through sunshine or rain
Through loss or in gain,
The blood flows from Calv'ry to cleanse ev'ry stain."
585;Be Glorified (P);;"In my life, Lord

171;They Come from the East and the West;C;"They come from the East and West,
They come from the lands afar,
To feast with the King,
   to dine as His guest:
How blessed these pilgrims are!
Beholding His hallow'd face
A glow with a light divine;
Blest partakers of His grace,
As gems in His crown to shine.

Chorus
Since Jesus has set me free,
I'm happy as heart can be;
No longer I bear
   the burden of care,
His yoke is so sweet to me.
My soul was as black as night,
But darkness has taken flight;
Now I shout the victory,
For Jesus has set me free.

I look on the great white throne,
Before it the ransom'd stand;
No longer are tears,
   no sorrow is known
Nor death in that goodly land.
My Savior has gone before,
Preparing the way for me;
Soon we'll meet to part no more
Thru time or eternity.

The gates of that holy place
Stand open by night and day;
O look to the Lord who
   ""giveth more grace,""
Whose love has prepar'd the way.
A home in those mansions fair
His hand hath reserv'd for all.
For the wedding feast prepare,
Obeying the gracious call."
172;The Healer;Eb;"On the Cross crucified,
In great sorrow He died;
The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised
   and rejected of men, 
This Jesus of Calvary.

Chorus
He was wounded for
   our transgressions,
He was bruised for 
   our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes 
   we are healed.

Price for healing was paid,
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgment hall.
Now His suff'ring affords perfect
   healing for all.
This wonderful Healer's mine.

Came the leper to Christ, saying,
""Surely I know, that Thou,
Lord, canst make me whole.""
When His great faith was seen
Jesus said, ""Yes, I will.""
And touch'd him and
   made him clean.

He has healed my sick soul,
Made me ev'ry whit whole,
And He'll do the same for you.
He's the same yesterday and
   today and for aye,
This Healer of men today."
173;Great is Thy Faithfulness;D;"Great is Thy faithfulness

There is no shadow of 
   turning with Thee

   compassions, they fail not

   forever will be

CHORUS
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies 
   I see
All I have needed Thy hand hath 
   provided
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord 
   unto me!

Summer and winter and springtime 
   and harvest
Sun, moon and stars in their 
   courses above
Join with all nature in manifold 
   witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy 
   and love

Pardon for sin and a peace that 
   endureth
Thine own dear presence to 
   cheer and to guide
Strength for today and bright 
   hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine, with ten 
   thousand beside!"
174;Speak, My Lord;G;"Hear the Lord of
   harvest sweetly calling,
""Who will go and work
   for me today? 
Who will bring to me the 
  lost and dying? 
Who will point them to 
   the narrow way?""

CHORUS
Speak, my Lord, 
Speak, my Lord,
Speak, and I'll be quick
   to answer Thee;
Speak, my Lord,
Speak, my Lord,
Speak and I will answer,
""Lord, send me.""

When the coal of fire. . . 
   touched the prophet,
Making him as pure, 
   as pure can be;
When the voice of God said, 
""Who'll go for us?""
Then he answered,
""Here I am, send me.""

Millions now in sin
   and shame are dying;
Listen to their sad
   and bitter cry;
Hasten, brother, 
   hasten to the rescue;
Quickly answer,
""Master, here am I.""

Soon the time for 
   reaping will be over;
Soon we'll gather 
   for the harvest-home;
May the Lord of harvest
   smile upon us,
May we hear His blessed,
""Child, well done."""
175;When He Reached Down His Hand For Me;C;"Once my soul was astray
   from the heavenly way,
And was wretched and
   vile as could be;
But my Saviour above,  
   gave me peace and joy and love,
When He reach'd down
   His hand for me, for me.

Chorus
When He reached down
   His hand for me,
When He reach'd down
   His hand for me;
I was lost and undone, 
   without God or His Son,
When He reach'd down
   His hand for me, for me.

I was nearing despair, 
When He came to me there,
And He showed me 
   that I could be free;
Then He lifted my feet,
   gave me glory complete,
When He reach'd down 
   His hand for me, for me.

How my heart doth rejoice 
   since I made Him my choice,
From the tempest to
   Him now I flee;
Now I lean on His arm, 
I'm secure from all harm. 
Since He reach'd down 
   His hand for me, for me.

Since the Lord gave me peace
Heavenly joys never cease, 
Lord, I give all my life unto Thee;
Guide my feet, hold my hand,
Grant with Thee I may stand. 
For you reach'd down your
   hand for me, for me."
176;When I See the Blood;C;"Christ our Redeemer
  died on the cross, 
Died for the sinner,
   paid all his due;
Sprinkle your soul with 
   the blood of the Lamb,
And I will pass, will 
   pass over you.

Chorus
When I see the blood, 
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
I will pass, I will pass
   over you.

Chiefest of sinners, 
Jesus will save;
All He has promised,
   that will He do;
Wash in the fountain 
   opened for sin,
And I will pass, will 
   pass over you.

Judgment is coming, 
   all will be there,
Each one receiving
   justly his due;
Hide in the saving,
   sin-cleansing blood,
And I will pass, will 
  pass over you.

Oh, great compassion! 
O boundless love!
O loving kindness,
  faithful and true!
Find peace and shelter
   under the blood,
And I will pass, will
 pass over you."

177;Baptized Into The Body;;"Have you been baptized into the body?
Baptized with the Holy Ghost;
There is but one way to enter in it,
Just as they did on pentecost.

Chorus
Are you in the church triumphant?
Are you in the Savior's bride?
Come and be baptized into the body,
And forevermore abide.

There is but one church, bride or body,
And into it we're all baptized;
By the one, true, promised Holy Spirit;
Though by the world we're all despised.

Every creed has claimed to be the body,
But the ""plumb line"" proved untrue
All their dreams, for God has so determined,
To bring His son's true bride to view.

Many thought that they were in the body,
'Till the Holy Ghost had come;
When the Word of God was opened to them
They entered in, and yet there's room.

Those who died before the Holy Spirit
Came upon us from on high,
May, by faith with saints of old departed,
Arise to meet Him in the sky.

When the bridegroom comes, will you be ready;
And your vessel all filled and bright?
You will be among the foolish virgins
If you do not walk in the light."
403;It's Not By Might, It's Not By Power, By My Spirit;D;"It's not by might; it's not by power;

This mountain shall be removed,
By My Spirit saith the Lord."

Fill me with life anew, 
That I may love what Thou dost love

Breath on me, Breath of God

Until my will is one with Thine
To do and to endure

Breath on me, Breath of God
Till I am wholly Thine
Until this earthly part of me
Glows with Thy fire divine

Breath on me, Breath of God
So shall I never die
But live with Thee the perfect life 
Of Thine eternity"
178;Victory In Jesus;G;"I heard an old, old story
How a Savior came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning,
Of His precious blood's atoning,
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory.

Chorus
O victory in Jesus,
My Savior forever,
He sought me and he bo't me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing pow'r revealing,
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see;
And then I cried ""dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit.""
And somehow Jesus came and bro't
To me the victory.

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there
The song of victory."
179;Above All;;"Above all powers, above all kings
Above all nature and all created things
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
You were here before the world began

Above all kingdoms, above all thrones
Above all wonders the world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
There's no way to measure what you're worth

Crucified, laid behind a stone
You lived to die, rejected and alone
Like a rose, trampled on the ground,
You took the fall and thought of me above all"
471;He's The Same God;;"He is the same God who spoke to the woman at the well.

With a solitary dime
For what good would a world do me
With leavin' on my mind"
