While hearts are aflame,
Help me humble my pride 
And call on Your Name;
Keep my faith renewed, 
Keep my eyes on Thee,
Help me be on this earth 
What You want me to be."
207;Marvelous Grace;F;"Marvelous grace 
Of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds 
Our sin and our guilt.
Yonder on Calvary's 
Mount outpoured,
There where the Blood 
Of the Lamb was spilt.

CHORUS
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that will pardon 
And cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater 
Than all our sin.

Sin and despair 
Like the sea waves cold, 
Threaten the soul 
With infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, 
Yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge, 
The Mighty Cross.

Dark is the stain 
That we cannot hide,
What can avail 
To wash it away?
Look! there is flowing 
A crimson tide;
Whiter than snow 
You may be today.

Marvelous, infinite, 
Matchless grace,
Freely bestowed 
On all who believe!
You that are longing 
To see His face,
Will you this moment 
His grace receive?"
208;When The Redeemed Gather;F;"I am thinking of the rapture 
In our blessed home on high.
When the redeemed are gathering in;
How we'll raise the heavenly anthem 
In that city in the sky,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

CHORUS
When the redeemed 
Are gathering in,
Washed like snow, 
And free from all sin;
How we'll shout, 
And how we'll sing,
When the redeemed 
Are gathering in.

There will be a great procession 
Over on the streets of gold,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Oh what music, Oh what singing, 
O'er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption's story 
With their voices clear and strong,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Then the angels all will listen, 
For they cannot join that song,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Then the Saviour will give orders 
To prepare the banquet board,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
And we'll hear His invitation, 
""Come, ye blessed of the Lord,""
When the redeemed are gathering in."
209;Some Golden Daybreak;F;"Some glorious morning 
Sorrow will cease,
Some glorious morning 
All will be peace;

Schooldays all done,
Heaven will open,

CHORUS
Some golden daybreak, 
Jesus will come;
Some golden daybreak, 
Battles all won,
He'll shout the victory, 
Break through the blue,
Some golden daybreak, 
For me, for you.

Sad hearts will gladden, 
All shall be bright,
Good-bye forever 
To earth's dark night;
Changed in a moment, 
Like Him to be,
Oh, glorious daybreak, 
Jesus I'll see.

Oh, what a meeting, 
There in the skies,
No tears nor crying 
Shall dim our eyes;
Loved ones united 
Eternally,
Oh, what a daybreak 
That morn will be."
210;Oh How I Love Jesus;F;"There is a name 
   I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music 
   in mine ear,
The sweetest name 
   on earth.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Jesus,
Oh how I love Jesus,
Oh how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me

It tells me of a Savior's love
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His 
   precious blood;
The sinner's perfect plea

It tells me what 
   my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread 
   a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

It tells of One whose 
   loving heart,
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow 
   bears a part,
That none can bear below.

To me, He is so wonderful,
To me, He is so wonderful,
To me, He is so wonderful,
Because He first loved me.

To me, You are so wonderful,
To me, You are so wonderful,
To me, You are so wonderful,
Because You first loved me.

I'll never forsake Him
I'll never forsake Him
I'll never forsake Him
Because You first loved me."
211;Fill My Way With Love;Eb;"Let me walk, blessed Lord,

Leading straight to the land above;
Giving cheer everywhere,

Fill my way every day with love.

CHORUS
Fill my way every day with love,
As I walk with the heavenly Dove;
Let me go all the while, with 
     a song and a smile,
Fill my way every day with love.

Keep me close to the side of 
     my Saviour and Guide,
Let me never in darkness rove;
Keep my path free from wrath, 
    and my soul satisfied,
Fill my way every day with love.

Soon the race will be o'er, and 
     I'll travel no more,
But abide in my home above;
Let me sing, blessed King, 
     all the way to the shore,
Fill my way every day with love."
212;I Love Him;C;"Gone from my heart the world
     and all its charms;
Now, through the blood, 
     I'm saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart 
     is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus 
     cleans white as snow.

CHORUS
I love Him, I love Him
Because He first loved me
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary's tree.

Once I was lost, and 'way down deep in sin,
Once was a slave to passions fierce within;
Once was afraid to trust a loving God;
But now I'm cleansed from every 
     stain through Jesus' blood.

Once I was bound, but now I am set free;
Once, I was blind, but now the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live,
To tell the world around 
     the peace that He doth give."
213;Zion's Hill;F;"There waits for me 
     a glad tomorrow,
Where gates of pearl swing 
     open wide,
And when I've passed this 
     vale of sorrow,
I'll camp upon the other side.

CHORUS
Some day beyond the reach 
     of mortal ken,
Some day, God only knows 
Just where and when,
The wheels of mortal life 
Shall all stand still,
And I shall go to dwell 
     on Zion's hill.

Some day I'll hear the 
     angels singing,
Beyond the shadows 
     of the tomb;
And all the bells of 
     heaven ringing,
While saints are singing, 
""Home, Sweet Home.""

Some day my labors will 
     be ended,
And all my wand'rings 
     will be o'er,
And all earth's broken ties 
     be mended,
And I shall sigh and weep 
     no more.

Some day the dark clouds 
     will be rifted,
And all the night of gloom 
     be past;
And all life's burdens 
     will be lifted,
The day of rest shall 
     dawn at last."
214;I Shall Not Be Moved;F;"Jesus is my Saviour, 
I shall not be moved;
In His love and favour, 
I shall not be moved;

I shall not be, 
I shall not be moved,
I shall not be, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In my Christ abiding, 
I shall not be moved;
In His love I'm hiding, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted

I shall not be moved.

If I trust Him ever, 
I shall not be moved:
He will fail me never, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

On His word I'm feeding, 
I shall not be moved,
He's the One that's leading, 
I shall not be moved,

     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Glory hallelujah, 
I shall not be moved;
Anchored in Jehovah, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by 
     the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In His love abiding, 
I shall not be moved;
And in Him confiding, 
I shall not be moved:
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though all hell assail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Jesus will not fail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though the tempest rages, 
I shall not be moved,
On the Rock of Ages, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved."

CHORUS
Yes, I feel like traveling on,
I feel like traveling on;
My heavenly home 
Is bright and fair,
I feel like traveling on.

Its glittering towers 
     the sun outshine,
I feel like traveling on;
That heavenly mansion 
     shall be mine,
I feel like traveling on.

Let others seek a home below,
I feel like traveling on;
Which flames devour, 
Or waves o'er flow,
I feel like traveling on.

The Lord has been so 
     good to me,
I feel like traveling on;
Until that blessed home I see,
I feel like traveling on."
216;I Am Marked;Ab;"I have lost my reputation 
Since I turned my back on sin,
And a lot of friends went from me 
Since I let my Saviour in;
Now they pass me by unknown, 
When they once passed with a smile;
Now they say I'm very foolish, 
And they say I'm out of style.

CHORUS
I am marked, marked, marked,
I am marked, now wherever I go;
I am marked, marked, marked,
Just what I am everyone seems to know.
I am sealed, sealed, sealed,
I am sealed by His Spirit Divine;
Oh glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen!
I am His and I know that He is mine.

Well, they say my life is ruined, 
And my talent thrown away,
And they cannot understand it, 
For I had such plans one day;
But I know what I surrendered 
When I promised I'd go through;
And I gained far more glory 
Since God made me over new."
217;Wings Of A Dove;C;"Noah had drifted
On the floods many days
He searched for land
In various ways
Troubles he had some,
But not from above,
God gave him His sign
On the wings of a dove.

CHORUS
On the wings of a 
   snow-white dove,
God sends His pure, 
   sweet love,
A sign from above, 
On the wings of a dove.

Jesus, our Saviour
Came to earth one day;
He was born in a stable,
In a manger of hay;
Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign,
On the wings of a dove.

Though I have suffered
In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;
Faith wasn't forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign
On the wings of a dove."
218;Beyond The Sunset;Db;"Beyond the sunset, 
Oh blissful morning,
When with our Saviour 
Heaven is begun.
Earth's toiling ended, 
Oh glorious dawning;
Beyond the sunset, 
when day is done.

Beyond the sunset 
No clouds will gather,
No storms will threaten, 
No fears annoy.
Oh day of gladness, 
Oh day unending;
Beyond the sunset, eternal joy.

Beyond the sunset, 
A hand will guide me
To God, the Father, 
Whom I adore;
His glorious presence, 
His words of welcome,
Will be my portion 
On that fair shore.

Beyond the sunset, 
Oh glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones 
Who've gone before.
In that fair homeland 
We'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset forevermore."
219;Shall We Gather At The River;C;"Shall we gather at the river, 
Where bright angel feet have trod,
With its crystal tide forever,
Flowing from the throne of God.

CHORUS
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river;
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows from the throne of God.

On the bosom of the river,
Where the Saviour-King we own,
We shall meet and sorrow never,
'Neath the glory of the throne.

On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy, golden day.

Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

At the smiling of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour's face,
Saints whom death will never sever
Lift their songs of saving grace.

Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace."
220;Must Jesus Bear Alone?;G;"Must Jesus bear the 
   cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross 
   for every one,
And there's a cross for me.

The consecrated 
   cross I'll bear,
Till death shall set me free,
And then go home 
   my crown to wear,
For there's a crown for me.

Upon the crystal 
   pavement, down
At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast 
   my golden crown,
And His dear name repeat.

Oh precious cross! 
Oh glorious crown!
Oh resurrection day!
Ye angels from the 
   stars come down
And bear my soul away."

CHORUS
Won't it be wonderful there?
Having no burdens to bear?
Joyously singing 
With heart-bells all ringing,
Oh won't it be wonderful there?

Walking and talking with Christ, 
     the supernal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Praising adoring the matchless 
     eternal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?

There where the tempest 
Will never be sweeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Sure that forever the Lord 
     will be  keeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?"
222;When I Reach That City;F;"On the top of Mount Zion is a city
And the earth with glory it doth fill;
I shall look on its beauty in the

When I reach that city on the hill.

CHORUS
Oh, that city on Mount Zion,
Tho' a pilgrim, yet I love thee still;
I'll not leave thee, through the ages,
When I reach that city on the hill.

I'm invited to come home to that city,
For the Word says, ""Whosoever will,""
And I'll find there a mansion for me
     waiting
When I reach that city on the hill.

Death will never molest me in that city,
Never leave me lying cold and chill;
And I'll enter to live up there forever
When I reach that city on the hill.

So I'll stay here until my Saviour 
     calls me,
Trying daily to perform His will;
Then He'll say unto me, ""Well done,""
     up yonder
When I reach that city on the hill."

His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God's love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race,
The saints and angels' song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;

Though stretched from sky to sky."

It's dripping with blood, Yes, 
It's dripping with blood,
This Holy Ghost Gospel

The blood of disciples 
Who died for the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, 
And John the divine,
They gave up their lives so 
This Gospel could shine;
They mingled their blood, 
Like the prophets of old,
So the true Word of God 
Could honest be told.

Then they stoned Stephen, 
He preached against sin,
He made them so angry, 
They dashed his head in;
But he died in the Spirit, 
And gave up the ghost,
And went to join others, 
In that life-giving host.

There's souls under the altar, 
Crying, ""How long?""
For the Lord to punish 
Those who've done wrong;
But there's going to be more 
Who'll give their life's blood
For this Holy Ghost Gospel 
And its crimson flood."

     the bitter goad and sting,
But what's inside those gates of pearl
     will be worth everything.

CHORUS
When we're inside the gates of pearl,
We'll learn a lot of things,
We'll have a harp that's made of gold,
Perhaps a thousand strings;
We'll sing and shout and dance about,
The Lamb will dry our tears;
We'll have a grand homecoming week,
The first ten thousand years.

The shadows now begin to fall,
     the time is drawing nigh,
When Christ our Lord shall come again
     like lightning from the sky.
And while we wait and suffer here, 
     praise God, we'll shout and sing,
For one glimpse through those gates
     of pearl will be worth everything.

The precious blood of God's own Son
     has saved and sanctified
A wondrous people for His name 
     and they are called the Bride.
Though here neglected and despised,
     one day the Lord will bring
His chosen ones within the gates,
     and that's worth everything."
233;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot;F;"I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home;
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

CHORUS
Swing low, sweet chariot, 
Coming for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do,
Coming for to carry me home;
Tell all my friends I'm a-coming too,
Coming for to carry me home."
234;Peace In The Valley;C;"Well, I'm tired and so weary, 
But I must go along;
Till the Lord comes and calls 
Me away, oh, yes;
Well the morning is bright 
And the Lamb is the Light;
And the night, night is as fair 
As the day, oh yes.

CHORUS
There will be peace in the valley 
For me some day;
There will be peace in the valley 
For me, oh, Lord, I pray;
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow,
     no trouble I'll see;
There will be peace 
In the valley for me.

There the flow'rs will be blooming, 
And the grass will be green;
And the skies will be clear 
And serene, oh, yes;
Well the sun ever beams, 
In this valley of dreams;
And no clouds there will ever 
Be seen,oh, yes.

Well, the bear will be gentle, 
And the wolf will be tame;
And the lion shall lay down 
By the lamb, oh, yes;
Well the beast from the wild, 
Shall be led by a little child;
And I'll be changed, changed 
From this creature that I am, oh, yes."
235;Wonderful;F;"Oh my heart sings today, 
Sings for joy and gladness,
Jesus saves, satisfies, 
Banishes my sadness;
Guilt is gone, peace is mine, 
Peace like to a river,
Jesus is wonderful, 
Mighty to deliver.

CHORUS
Wonderful, wonderful, 
Jesus is to me,
Counselor, Mighty God
Prince of Peace is He;
Saving me, keeping me 
From all sin and shame,
Wonderful is my Redeemer, 
Praise His name!

Once a slave, now I'm free, 
Free from condemnation,
Jesus gives liberty 
And a full salvation;
Now the sins of the past 
Have been all forgiven,
And my name is inscribed 
On the book of heaven.

Living here with my Lord 
In a holy union,
Day by day, all the way 
Holding sweet communion;
Oh what change grace hath wrought 
In my lowly station!
Since my soul has received 
Full and free salvation."
236;I'll Be Listening;F;"When the Saviour calls 
   I will answer,
When He calls for me I will hear;
When the Saviour calls 
   I will answer,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
   for my name.

CHORUS
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
   for my name;
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
   for my name.

If my heart is right when 
   He calls me,
If my heart is right I will hear;
If my heart is right when 
   He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
   for my name.

If my robe is white when 
   He calls me,
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white when 
   He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
   for my name."
237;Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus;F;"O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free!

CHORUS
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion,
For more than conqu'rors we are!

His Word shall not fail you, 
     He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well;
Then go to a world that is dying, 
His perfect salvation to tell!"
238;A Child Of The King;Eb;"My Father is rich in 
     houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of 
      the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, 
      of silver and gold
His coffers are full, 
     He has riches untold.

CHORUS
I'm a child of the King!
A child of the King!
With Jesus my Saviour,
I'm a child of the King!

My Father's own Son, 
      the Saviour of men,
Once wandered o'er earth 
     as the poorest of  them;
But now He is reigning 
     forever on high,
And will give me a home 
     in heav'n by and by.

I once was an outcast, 
     stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, 
     and an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted, 
     my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, 
     a robe, and a crown.

A tent or a cottage, 
     why should I care?
They're building a palace 
     for me over there!
Though exiled from home, 
     yet still I may sing:
All glory to God, 
     I'm a child of the King!"
239;Battle Hymn Of The Republic;Ab;"Mine eyes have seen the glory
     of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of 
   wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
     of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
     of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
     in the evening dews and damps
I can read His righteous sentence
     by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
     that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
     before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
     be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
     Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom
     that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
     let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on."
240;The Unveiled Christ;C;"Once Our blessed Christ of beauty, 
Was veiled off from human view;
But through suff'ring, 
     death and sorrow,
He has rent the veil in two.

CHORUS
Oh behold the man of sorrows,
Oh behold Him in plain view,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Yes, He is with God, the Father,
Interceding there for you;
For He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due,
For He is the well beloved,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Throughout time and endless ages,
Heights and depths of love so true,
He alone can be the giver,
Since He rent the veil in two."
241;Hold To God's Hand;F;"Time is filled with swift transition,
Naught of earth unmoved can stand,
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging hand!

CHORUS
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging hand!

Trust in Him who will not leave you,
Whatsoever years may bring,
If by earthly friends forsaken,
Still more closely to Him cling!

Covet not this world's vain riches,
That so rapidly decay,
Seek to gain the heavenly treasures,
They will never pass away!

When your journey is completed,
If to God you have been true,
Fair and bright the home in glory,
Your enraptured soul will view!"
242;One Day;C;"One day when heaven 
Was filled with His praises,
One day when sin 
Was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth 
To be born of a virgin -
Dwelt amongst men, 
My example is He!

CHORUS
Living, He loved me; 
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried 
My sins far away;
Rising, He justified 
Freely forever:
One day He's coming - 
Oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him 
Up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him 
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, 
Despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins, 
My Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him 
Alone in the garden,
One day He rested, 
From suffering free;
Angels came down 
O'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, 
My Saviour is He!

One day the grave could 
Conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled 
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death 
He had conquered;
Now is ascended, 
My Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will 
Sound for His coming,
One day the skies with 
His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, 
My beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour, 
This Jesus is mine!"
243;The Lifeboat;F;"We're floating down the stream of time,
We have not long to stay;
The stormy clouds of darkness
Will turn to brightest day.
Then let us all take courage,
For we're not left alone;
The lifeboat soon is coming
To gather the Jewels home.

Chorus
Then cheer, my brother, cheer,
Our trials will soon be o'er,
Our loved ones we shall meet, shall meet,
Upon the golden shore.
We're pilgrims and we're strangers here,
We're seeking a city to come,
The lifeboat soon is coming,
To gather the Jewels home.

Sometimes the Devil tempts me,
And says it's all in vain
To try to live a Christian life
And walk in Jesus' name;
But then we hear the Master say,
""I'll lend you a helping hand,
And if you'll only trust Me,
I'll guide you to the land.""

The lifeboat soon is coming,
By eyes of faith I see
As she sweeps through the waters
To rescue you and me,
And land us safely in the port
With friends we love so dear.
""Get ready,"" cries the Captain;
""Oh, look, she's almost here.""

Oh, now's the time to get on board,
While she is passing by;
But if you stand and wait too long, 
You shall forever die;
The fare is paid for one and all,
The Captain bids you come,
And get on board the lifeboat,
She'll carry you safely home."
244;Down From His Glory;Eb;"Down from His glory, 
Ever living story,
My God and Saviour came, 
And Jesus was His Name.
Born in a manger, 
To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, 
Tears and agony.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Him!  
How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, 
My all in all!
The great Creator 
Became my Saviour,
And all God's fullness 
Dwelleth in Him.

What condescension, 
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night, 
Not one faint hope in sight;
God, gracious, tender, 
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, 
To save my soul.

Without reluctance, 
Flesh and blood His substance,
He took the form of man, 
Revealed the hidden plan.
Oh glorious mystery, 
Sacrifice of Calvary,
And now I know 
Thou art  the great ""I Am."""
245;Bound For The Promised Land;Eb;"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye,
Toward Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

CHORUS
I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns,
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds, nor pois'nous breath,
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
Are feared and felt no more.

When shall I reach that happy place, 
And be forever blest!
When shall I see my Father's face,
And in His bosom rest?"
246;How Great Thou Art;Ab;"Oh Lord my God!  
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds 
Thy hands have made;
I see the stars, 
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy pow'r throughout 
The universe displayed.

CHORUS
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great Thou art!"
247;Leave It There;F;"If the world from you withholds 
Of its silver and its gold,
And you have to get along 
With meager fare,
Just remember, in His Word, 
How He feeds the little bird;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

CHORUS
Leave it there, leave it there,
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there;
If you trust and never doubt,
He will surely bring you out;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

If your body suffers pain 
And your health you can't regain,
And your soul is 
Almost sinking in despair,
Jesus knows the pain you feel,
He can save and He can heal;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your enemies assail
And your heart begins to fail,
Don't forget that God 
In heaven answers prayer;
He will make a way for you 
And will lead you safely through;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your youthful days are gone
And old age is stealing on,
And your body bends 
Beneath the weight of care;
He will never leave you then,
He'll go with you to the end;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there."
248;What A Day That Will Be;F;"There is coming a day 
When no heartaches shall come,
No more clouds in the sky, 
No more tears to dim the eye;
All is peace forevermore 
On that happy golden shore,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

CHORUS
What a day that will be
When my Jesus I shall see,
When I look upon His face, 
The One who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand,
And leads me through 
The Promised Land,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

There'll be no sorrow there, 
No more burdens to bear,
No more sickness, no pain, 
No more parting over there;
And forever I will be 
With the One who died for me,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be."
249;Nothing Between;F;"Nothing between my soul 
   and the Saviour,
Naught of this world's 
   delusive dream:
I have renounced all 
   sinful pleasure,
Jesus is mine, there's 
   nothing between.

CHORUS
Nothing between my soul 
   and the Saviour,
So that His blessed face 
   may be seen;
Nothing preventing the 
   least of His favour,
Keep the way clear! 
   Let nothing between.

Nothing between like 
   worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though 
   harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from 
   Him ever sever;
He is my all, there's 
   nothing between.

Nothing between, 
   like pride or station;
Self or friends shall 
   not intervene;
Though it may cost 
   me much tribulation,
I am resolved, 
   there's nothing between.

Nothing between, 
   e'en many hard trials,
Though the whole world 
   against me convene;
Watching with prayer 
   and much self-denial,
I'll triumph at last, 
   with nothing between."
250;In Times Like These;F;"In times like these you need a Saviour,
In times like these you need an anchor
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

CHORUS
This rock is Jesus, Yes, He's the One,
This rock is Jesus, the only One;
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these you need the Bible,
In times like these oh be not idle,
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these, I have a Saviour,
In times like these, I have an anchor,
I'm very sure, I'm very sure,
My anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock."
251;He Abides;F;"I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the pilgrim way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see,
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, 
He abides,
Hallelujah, He abides with me
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care
I'm as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me!

There's no thirsting for the things
Of the world, they've taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter abides with me!"
252;That Man From Galilee;Eb;"In a manger long ago, 
I know it's really so,
A Babe was born 
To save men from their sin.
John saw Him on the shore, 
The Lamb forevermore,
Oh, the Christ, 
The Crucified of Calvary.

CHORUS
Oh I love that Man from Galilee,
For He's done so very much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins, 
Placed the Holy Ghost within;
Oh I love that man 
     from Galilee.

The publican went to pray 
In the temple there one day,
He cried, ""O Lord 
     be merciful to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this Man 
     from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk, 
The dumb was made to talk,
That power was spoken with 
Love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man 
     from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of Man 
What must he do.
These words He said to him, 
""Ye must be born again,""
By the Spirit of that Man 
     from Galilee.

The woman at the well, 
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands 
She had at that time,
She was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that 
     Man from Galilee!"""
253;Then Jesus Came;C;"One sat alone beside the 
    highway begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he 
    could not see;
He clutched his rags and shivered 
    in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and bade his 
    darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the tempter's 
    power is broken;
When Jesus comes, the tears 
    are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the 
    life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus 
    comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil 
    spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
He cut himself as demon pow'rs 
    possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the 
    captive free.

Unclean! unclean! The leper cried 
    in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness 
    stood near;
The fever raged, disease had gripped 
    its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast 
    out every fear.

So men today have found the 
    Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion, 
    lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them sad 
    and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt 
    Himself within."
254;Such Love;F;"That God should love 
A sinner such as I,
Should yearn to change
My sorrow into bliss,
Nor rest till He 
Had planned to bring me nigh,
How wonderful is love like this!

CHORUS
Such love, such wondrous love,
Such love, such wondrous love,
That God should love 
A sinner such as I,
How wonderful is love like this!

That Christ should join 
So freely in the scheme,
Although it meant 
His death on Calvary,
Did ever human tongue 
Find nobler theme
Than love divine 
That ransomed me?

That for a wilful 
Outcast such as I,
The Father planned, 
The Saviour bled and died;
Redemption for 
A worthless slave to buy,
Who long had law 
And grace defied.

And now He takes me 
To His heart, a son,
He asks me not 
To fill a servant's place;
The ""far-off country"" 
Wand'rings all are done,
Wide open are 
His arms of grace."
255;When The Saints March In;Eb;"I'm a pilgrim and a stranger
Wand'ring through this world of sin,
On my way to that fair city,
When the Saints go marching in.

CHORUS
When the saints go marching in,
When the saints go marching in,
Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in.

Oh, I know I'll see my Saviour 
If my life is free from sin,
Heaven's doors will open for me
When the Saints go marching in.

When we gather 'round the Throne
And the gates are closed within,
I'll be shouting ""Glory, Glory""
When the Saints go marching in.

I'm waiting for the chariot
To swing low and I'll step in,
On the clouds I'll ride to Heaven
When the Saints go marching in.

When the sun refuse to shine,
When the sun refuse to shine,
Lord, I want to be in that number
When the sun refuse to shine."
256;The Day Of Redemption;F;"Nations are breaking, 
Israel's awaking,
The signs that the prophets 
     foretold;
The Gentile days numbered, 
With horrors encumbered;
Eternity soon will unfold.

CHORUS
The day of redemption is near,
Men's hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Your lamps trimmed and clear,
Look up! Your redemption is near

The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem's restoring
Her national life, long dethroned;
Today she is calling, 
Her latter rain's falling,
""Return, Oh dispersed, to your own.""

Heaven's powers are shaking, 
And many are mistaking
God's meaning to be of the sky;
God's Church is the power
That's shaking this hour:
The day of redemption is nigh.

False prophets are lying, 
God's Truth they're denying,
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generation 
Spurns God's revelation,
We'll walk where the apostles 
     have trod."
257;Oh My Loving Brother;F;"Oh the judgment day is coming
What an awful day 'twill be,
Christ forever is my refuge
Rock of ages cleft for me.

CHORUS
Oh, my loving brother,
When the world's on fire,
Don't you want God's bosom
To be your pillow,
Hide me over in the rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me.

At the sounding of the trumpet,
At the dawning of the day,
Worldly pleasures with their treasures,
Shall forever pass away.

Poor lost sinners will be crying,
For the home they'll never see,
But the ransomed will be singing
Rock of ages, cleft for me."
258;Lights Of That City;F;"John tells of a city, 
That he saw coming down,
Where no sorrow or death will be known,
That someday we could go there
Through His marvelous grace,
Forever live in that heavenly home.

CHORUS
I can almost see the lights of that city,
I see them gathering, all around
The great white throne;
With faith in my Saviour,
And His wonderful love,
Oh, I can almost see the lights of home.

And sometimes when I'm burdened,
And my cross seems hard to bear.
And old Satan, he tries to dim my view,
Well I just look unto Jesus,
He is standing close by,
Then once again, 
His great light shines through."
259;I'm Looking For A City;F;"I'm looking for a city,
The one not made by hands,
I'm looking over Jordan,
I see the promised land,
The waters will be parted
And I'll be on my way,
As we're crossing over Jordan 
I can say:

CHORUS
Now I have that everlasting 
   joy within,
Since He came and took 
   away my sin,
The moment that He blessed me,
He made me fully whole,
With that everlasting joy 
Within my soul.

I'm drinking from the fountain
That floweth from on high,
A well of blessed waters
That never shall run dry,
I'm feasting on God's manna,
I'm praying day by day,
And that everlasting joy 
Is here to stay.

I've heard the prophet's message, 
I've placed it in my heart,
I've got the revelation 
That never shall depart,
The Rapture is upon us,
The stage is set to go.
Don't try to hold me back
You ought to know!"
260;All That Thrills My Soul;Bb;"Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
By His presence all divine?
True and Tender, pure and precious,
Oh how blest to call Him mine!

CHORUS
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me;
And the fairest of ten thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.

Love of Christ so freely given,
Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea.

What a wonderful redemption!
Never can a mortal know
How my sin, tho' red like crimson,
Can be whiter than the snow.

Every need His hand supplying,
Every good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying,
He is all in all to me.

By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King."
261;Come And Go With Me;F;"Come and go with me
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House.
Come and go with me,
To my Father's House,
Where There's peace, peace, peace.

Jesus will be there
In my Father's House
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House.
Jesus will be there
In my Father's House,
Where there's peace, peace, peace.

There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House, 
In my Father's House.
There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House.
There'll be joy, real joy."
262;I'll Fly Away;G;"Some glad morning 
When this life is o'er
I'll fly away,
To a home on God's 
     celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away, oh glory, 
I'll fly away;
Before I go, 
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows 
Of this life have grown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird from prison 
     bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more 
Weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys 
     shall never end,
I'll fly away.

I'll fly away, oh glory, 
I'll fly away;
When Jesus comes, 
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away."
263;It Is Love;F;"There is something in my soul 
Which keeps the shadows all away;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something lightens ev'ry burden,
Gives me gladness day by day,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

CHORUS
Oh the precious love of Jesus,
How it thrills my ransomed soul!
More and more I'll sing its praises
While the happy ages roll.

When the tempter tries to win me
Something keeps me true and strong;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something makes my life a blessing
To the needy in the throng,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

When misfortune overtakes me
Something calms my troubled breast;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something draws my soul to heaven,
That sweet land of peace and rest.
It is love, my Saviour's love.

Soul astray and bowed in sorrow,
Something waits for you today;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
It would give you peace and comfort,
Make your burdens roll away,
It is love, my Saviour's love."
264;My Sins Are Gone;Eb;"You ask me why I'm happy
So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;
And when I meet the scoffers
Who ask me where they are,
I say, my sins are gone.

CHORUS
They're underneath the Blood,
Of the Cross of Calvary,
As far removed as darkness 
     is from dawn;
In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
That's good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me 
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

I'm living now for Jesus,
I'm happy night and day,
Because my sins are gone;
My soul is filled with music,
With all my heart I say,
I know my sins are gone."
265;He Set Me Free;F;"Once like a bird 
In prison I dwelt.
No freedom from 
My sorrow I felt.
Then Jesus came 
And listened to me,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

CHORUS
He set me free, 
Yes, He set me free.
He broke the bonds 
Of prison for me.
I'm glory bound 
My Jesus to see,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

Now I am climbing 
Higher each day,
Darkness of night 
Has drifted away.
My feet are planted 
On higher ground,
Glory to God, 
I'm homeward bound.

Good-bye to sin 
And things that confound,
Naught of this world 
Shall turn me around,
Daily I'm working, 
I'm praying too,
Glory to God, 
I'm going through."
266;The Great Emancipator;Ab;"Once my heart and soul were fettered
By the binding chains of sin.
But the Great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Blessed be His holy name!
He's the Great Emancipator,
That's the song of the Redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting
Oh so helpless and alone, 
But the seeking Shepherd found me,
Led me to my Father's home."
267;The Original Life;Ab;"God's attributes were manifested
To His Bride in this last age.
We have caught the revelation
By the last prophet's message.
And we know who we are
And what we are raised up for,
Praise the Lord, for the Original Life.

CHORUS
The Original Life, the Original Seed
The Original Word is what I believe.
The Son of Man is revealed
The seventh seal is unveiled
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say.
And our names are seen within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin.
Yes, we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who's the Original Life.

Our eyes of understanding
He has opened up at last.
And sweet victory is ours
Who were chained down in the past.
True Jubilee has sounded
And we have responded
To our God, Who's the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power.
Sleeping saints will wake and join us
For translation in this hour.
Gentiles' days will soon be over
Glory, hallelujah!
To our God, Who's the Original Life."
268;All In All;F;"Of Jesus love I'm singing
I praise Him every day;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He frees my soul from bondage,
He takes my guilt away;
Jesus is my All in All.

CHORUS
All in All, All in All,
A strength in time of weariness
A light when shadows fall.
All in All, All in All,
Jesus is my All in All.

He's patient and so tender,
So loving and so kind;
He is my All in All, All in All.
Another Friend so faithful
My soul will never find;
Jesus is my All in All.

In time of need no other
To me can prove so dear;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He hears me tho' I whisper,
To help me he is near;
Jesus is my All in All."
269;Till We Meet;Bb;"God be with you 'til we meet again!
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!

CHORUS
Till we meet! 'Til we meet!
Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
Till we meet! 'Til we meet!
God be with you 'til we meet again!

God be with you 'til we meet again!
'Neath His wings securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!

God be with you 'til we meet again!
When life's perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!

God be with you 'til we meet again!
Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
Smite death's threat'ning wave 
     before you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!"
270;More About Jesus;F;"More about Jesus I would know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

CHORUS
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus in His Word, 
Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace."
271;Psalms 19;Eb;"The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure,
Making wise the simple.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The statutes of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure,
Enlightening the eyes.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.
And in the keeping of them
There is great reward,
There is great reward.
In the keeping of them
There is great reward."
272;The Church's One Foundation;C;"The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord:
She is His new creation
By water and the Word.
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth,
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping
Their cry goes up, ""How long?""
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song.

Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore.
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the church at rest."
274;Deeper In That Holy Life;F;"Deeper In Thy love, Oh Jesus
Doth my spirit cry to go.
Until all my life is hidden 
Deep within the cleansing flow.

CHORUS
Deeper in that holy life
'Til I'm lost with Christ in God.
Hidden with my blessed Lord
While I walk this earthly sod.

Humbly must I walk with Jesus
In the paths that He doth lead.
Never falter, never murmur
Always to His voice give heed.

Daily must I seek to please Him
Whether it bring joy or pain.
I shall know then just how blessed
Is the worth of Heav'nly gain.

Deeper, 'til at last in Glory
In His likeness I shall come.
Where the saints of all the ages
Shall receive their welcome home."
275;We Are Heirs;Ab;"We are heirs of the Father
We are joint-heirs with the Son.
We are people of His Kingdom
We are family, we are one.

We are washed,
We are sanctified.
We are cleansed by His blood.
We are born of the Spirit
We are children of the Lord.

We are members of His body.
We are objects of His love.
We're partakers of His holiness
We are citizens of heaven above.

We're partakers of His suffering;
We're partakers of His grace.
We shall meet Him to be like Him
We shall see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming
We are looking to the skies;
We are watching, we are waiting,
We shall dwell with Him, 
   we shall rise.

We shall reign with Him forever;
Men and angels shout and sing.
For dominion has been given
To the family of the King."
276;He's The Lord Of Glory;Eb;"Behold what manner of man is this,
Who stills the raging sea.
He heals the sick, the lame, the halt,
And makes the blind to see.
He opens all the prison doors
And sets the captives free.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

CHORUS
He's the Lord of glory
He is the great ""I Am""
The Alpha and Omega,
The beginning and the end.
His name is Wonderful
The Prince of Peace is He
He's the everlasting Father
Throughout eternity.

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who spake to the woman at the well.
Everlasting life I will give to thee,
Far richer than man can tell
And whosoever shall drink of the well
Shall live eternally.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who speaks to the lame and halt.
He says ""Thy sins be forgiven thee,
Take up thy bed and walk""
He stands as the mighty healer now
And cries ""Come unto me""
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this
Who stands between God and man.
His eyes are as a flame of fire
His fan is in His hand.
John saw Him in the seven churches
As the sun in brilliancy
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who sits on His heavenly throne.
He rules and reigns from heaven above
His beloved and His own.
He's the lion of the tribe of Judah,
The root of David is He.
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?"
277;He Touched Me;Eb;"Shackled by a heavy burden
'Neath a load of guilt and shame,
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
And now I am no longer the same.

CHORUS
He touched me,
Oh, He touched me,
And oh, the joy 
That floods my soul!
Something wonderful happened
And now I know,
He touched me, 
And made me whole.

Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed 
And made me whole,
I shall never cease to praise Him
I'll shout it while eternity rolls."
278;This World Is Not My Home;F;"This world is not my home
I'm just a'passing through
My treasures are laid up 
Somewhere beyond the blue.
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

CHORUS
Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

They're all expecting me
And that's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus
Many years ago.
I know He'll see me through
Tho' I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Just over in the gloryland,
We'll live eternally;
The saints on every hand
Are shouting ""victory"".
The songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore."
279;Lead Me To Calvary;Eb;"King of my life I crown Thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned 
     brow,
Lead me to Calvary.

CHORUS
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony,
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou 
     wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept:
Angels in robes of light arrayed,
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me, like Mary, through 
     the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee:
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear,
Daily my cross for Thee:
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Fill me, Oh Lord, with Thy desire,
For all who know not Thee:
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
To speak of Calvary."
280;I Don't Know What I'd Do;F;"I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord;
When I look around and see,
All that He has done for me,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord.

281;Whisper A Prayer;F;"Whisper a prayer in the morning,
Whisper a prayer at noon,
Whisper a prayer in the evening,
To keep your heart in tune.

God answers prayer in the morning,
God answers prayer at noon,
God answers prayer in the evening,
So keep your heart in tune.

Jesus may come in the morning,
Jesus may come at noon,
Jesus may come in the evening,
So keep your heart in tune."
282;It Is Well With My Soul;C;"When peace like a river
Attendeth my way,
When sorrows, 
Like sea billows roll;
Whatever my Lord, 
Thou hast taught me to say,
""It is well, it is well with my soul.""

CHORUS
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well 
With my soul.

Though Satan should buffet,
Though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control.
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood
     for my soul.

My sin - oh, the bliss 
Of this glorious thought -
My sin - not in part, 
But the whole
Is cleansed by His blood;
And I have it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Oh my soul.

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ
   hence to live!
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in
   death as in life,
Thou shalt whisper Thy peace
   to my soul.

And Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight.
The clouds be rolled back 
     as a scroll.
The trump shall resound, 
And the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul."
283;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God;C;"A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe -
His craft and pow'r are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He -
Lord Sabaoth His name,
From age to age the same -
And He must win the battle.

And tho this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph thru us.
The Prince of darkness grim - 
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! His doom is sure -
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow'rs -
No thanks to them - abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Thru Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still -
His kingdom is forever."

285;Arise, My Soul, Arise;Ab;"Arise, my soul, arise;
Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding sacrifice
    in my behalf appears:
Before the throne my surety stands,
Before the throne my surety stands,
My name is written on His hands.

He ever lives above, 
For me to intercede;
His all redeeming love, 
His precious blood, to plead:
His blood atoned for all our race,
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

Five bleeding wounds He bears;
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers; 
They strongly plead for me:
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Nor let that ransomed sinner die!""

The Father hears Him pray,
His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away, 
The presence of His Son;
His Spirit answers to the blood,
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.

My God is reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear:
With confidence I now draw nigh,
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And ""Father, Abba, Father,"" cry."
286;His Way With Thee;F;"Would you live for Jesus and 
     be always pure and good?
Would you walk with Him 
     within the narrow road?
Would you have Him bear your 
     burden, carry all your load?
Let Him have His way with thee.

CHORUS
His pow'r can make you what you
     ought to be,
His blood can cleanse your heart
     and make you free:
His love can fill your soul,
And you will see 'twas best for Him
To have His way with Thee.

Would you have Him make you free, 
     and follow at His call?
Would you know the peace that
     comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you,
     so that you need never fall?
Let Him have His way with Thee.

Would you in His kingdom find
     a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true
     in providential test?
Would you in His service labour
     always at your best?
Let Him have His way with Thee."
287;I'm Longing For Jesus To Come;F;"I'm longing for that glorious day
When Jesus shall come back,
I long to see His blessed face.
When all the saints 
Throughout the ages
Shall be gathered home
The ones who trusted in His grace

CHORUS
I'm longing for Jesus to come back
I long for Jesus Christ my King
To come and take me
To my home beyond the skies,
Up there where angels shout and sing.

Sometimes the road 
Seems rough and hard,
The pathway seems so long,
But He is ever by my side.
He whispers loving words to me
And tells me to be strong,
That He will always lead and guide."
288;Thank God I Am Free;G;"For a long time I travelled
Down a long lonely road;
My heart was so heavy in sin I sank low.
Then I heard about Jesus,
What a wonderful hour;
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out
Through His saving power.

CHORUS
Thank God I am free, free, free
From this world of sin.
Been washed in the blood of Jesus,
I've been born again.
Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved
By His wonderful grace.
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out 
And show me the way.

Like a bird out of prison
That's taken its flight;
Like a blind man that God 
Gave back his sight.
Like a poor wretched beggar
That's found fortune and fame,
I'm so glad that I found out 
He could bring me out
Thro' His Holy name."
289;Land Of Milk And Honey;G;"There is a land of milk and honey
There is a land
Where we won't need money.
There is a land 
Shining with jasper.
There we shall see 
Our blessed Saviour.

CHORUS
And that's the reason
We shout ""Hallelujah""
Praising our King across the river.
That shining river
Where the saints will gather
There we shall see 
Our blessed Messiah.

Elijah has come, 
He has done his work already
As John has said, 
The Bride has made ready.
And now we are waiting 
For the coming of Jesus.
For that blessed day
When the Lamb shall take us.

Our hopes are bright, 
Our lamps are burning.
And day by day 
Our hearts are yearning.
This is the evening
He will come in the morning.
Then we shall wait 
Until the dawning."
290;He Paid A Debt;C;"He paid a debt He did not owe,
I owed a debt I could not pay,
I needed someone to wash 
     my sins away;
And now I sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay.

He paid a debt at Calvary,
He cleansed my soul and 
     set me free,
I'm glad that Jesus did all 
     my sins erase.
I now can sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay.

One day He's coming back for me,
To live with Him eternally,
Won't it be glory to see Him 
     on that day!
I then will sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay."
291;Until Then;Ab;"My heart can sing 
When I pause to remember,
A heartache here  
Is but a stepping stone,
Along the trail 
That's winding always upward,
This troubled world 
Is not my final home.

CHORUS
But until then, 
My heart will go on singing,
Until then, 
With joy I'll carry on.
Until the day 
Mine eyes behold the city
Until the day 
God calls me home.

The things of earth 
Will dim and lose their value,
If we recall, 
They're borrowed for awhile
And things of earth 
That cause the heart to tremble
Remember there,

From glory land over the sea;
A soul-thrilling message 
From Jesus our Lord,
And this is like heaven to me."

They're white as snow,
I was bound but today I am free;
I was lost in the darkness
But now I'm found,
I was blind but now I see.

When at last in His presence
I stand above,
He will wipe every tear 
From my eyes;
And I'll thank Him for giving 
A wretch like me,
A new home beyond the sky."

And lay, lay hold on the new,
In laying it down a new life is found
There a new life waits for you.

Cast your bread upon the waters
After many days it shall return.
If you pour out your soul
Not a part, but the whole
A new life is there for you.

In saving your life, you will lose it,
But by losing it, you will find it,
Down in the ground 
That's where death is found,
Death that brings life anew."

With thorns they crowned His head,
As a lamb unto the slaughter

Was thrust into His side,

     Holy Ghost,
And pow'r for service came;
Now what He did for them that day
He will do for you the same;
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

Come, my brother, seek this blessing
That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy-bells ringing
And will keep the soul aflame;
It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His name,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!"
322;Living Where the Healing Waters Flow;F;"I've cast my heavy burdens down 
      on Canaan's happy shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
I'll wander in the wilderness of
      doubt and sin no more;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

Chorus 
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, 
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

With Israel's trusting children
     I'm rejoicing on my way, 
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
The cloudy, fiery pillar
     is my guiding light today.
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

My hung'ring soul is satisfied 
     with manna from above,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
No more I thirst, the rock I've found,
      that fount of endless love;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

I'm singing ""Hallelujah,""
      safely anchored in my soul,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
I'm resting on his promises; 
      the blood has made me whole.
I'm living where the healing waters flow."
323;Hidden Peace;C;"I cannot tell thee whence it came. 
This peace within my breast;
But this I know, there fills my soul
A strange and tranquil rest.

Chorus
There's a deep, settled peace in my soul,
There's a deep settled peace in my soul;
Tho' the billows of sin near me roll, 
He abides, Christ abides.

Beneath the toil and care of life,
This hidden stream flows on;
My weary soul no longer thirsts,
Nor am I sad and lone.

I cannot tell the half of love,
Unfeigned, supreme, divine,
That caused my darkest in-most self
With beams of hope to shine.

I cannot tell thee why He chose
To suffer and to die,
But if I suffer here with Him
I'll reign with Him on high."
324;I Would Not Be Denied;C;"When pangs of death 
Seized on my soul,
Unto the Lord I cried,
Till Jesus came and 
     made me whole,
I would not be denied.

CHORUS
I would not be denied,
I would not be denied,
Till Jesus came and 
     made me whole,
I would not be denied.

As Jacob in the days of old,
I wrestled with the Lord;
And instant, with 
     a courage bold,
I stood upon His word.

Old Satan said my Lord 
     was gone
And would not hear my prayer,
But, praise the Lord! 
The work is done
And Christ the Lord is here."
325;The Solid Rock;F;"My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

CHORUS
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne."
326;Deeper, Deeper;G;"Deeper, deeper,
In the love of Jesus
Daily let me go;
Higher, higher,
In the school of wisdom,
More of grace to know.

CHORUS
Deeper yet, I pray,
And higher every day,
And wiser, blessed Lord,
In Thy precious, holy Word.

Deeper, deeper!  
Blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is 
Wholly lost in Jesus,
And His perfect will.

Deeper, deeper! 
Though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the 
Holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

Deeper, higher, 
Every day in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqueror, 
And in His own image
Perfected at last."
327;It Is Truly Wonderful;Bb;"He pardoned my transgressions, 
He sanctified my soul,
He honors my confessions, 
Since by His blood I'm whole.

Chorus
It is truly wonderful 
What the Lord has done!
It is truly wonderful! 
It is truly wonderful!
It is truly wonderful  
What the Lord has done!
Glory to His name.

He keeps me every moment  
By trusting in His grace;
'Tis thro His blest atonement,  
That I may see His face.

He brings me through affliction,  
He leaves me not alone;
He's with me in temptation, 
He keeps me for His own.

He prospers and protects me,  
His blessings ever flow;
He fills me with His glory, 
He makes me white as snow.

He keeps me firm and faithful,  
His love I do enjoy,
For this I shall be grateful,
And live in His employ.

There's not a single blessing  
Which we receive on earth
That does not come from heaven,  
The source of our new birth."
328;Beulah Land;F;"I've reached the land of 
   corn and wine, 
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed 
   one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.

Chorus
Oh Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.
As on Thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory-shore,
My heav'n, my home forevermore!

My Savior comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by the hand, 
For this is heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from eververnal trees,
And flow'rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody.
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song."
329;A Shelter In The Time Of Storm;F;"The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever ill be tide,
A shelter in the time of storm.

CHORUS
Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land,
A weary land, A weary land;
Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land -
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shade by day, defense by night,
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes afright,
A shelter in the time of storm.

The raging storms may round us beat,
A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.

Oh Rock divine, Oh Refuge dear,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our Helper ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm."
330;The Haven of Rest;F;"My soul in sad exile 
Was out on life's sea,
So burdened with sin 
     and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice 
Saying, ""Make me your choice;""
And I entered the Haven of Rest.

CHORUS
I've anchored my soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
I'll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep 
O'er the wild, stormy deep;
In Jesus I'm safe evermore.

I yielded myself 
To his tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, 
And I anchored my soul;
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, 
Since the Lord made me whole,    
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus who'll save 
Whosoever will have
A home in the Haven of Rest.

How precious the thought 
That we all may recline,
Like John the beloved and blest,
On Jesus' strong arm 
Where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the Haven of Rest.

Oh come to the Savior, 
He patiently waits,
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
And say, ""My Beloved is mine."""
332;Standing On The Promises;Ab;"Standing on the promises 
Of Christ my King,
Through eternal ages
Let His praises ring;
Glory in the highest 
I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.

CHORUS
Standing, standing, 
Standing on the promises 
Of God, my Savior;
Standing, standing, 
I'm standing on 
The promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
That cannot fail,
When the howling storms 
Of doubt and fear assail,
By the living Word of God 
I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I now can see
Perfect, present cleansing 
In the blood for me;
Standing in the liberty 
Where Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
Of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally 
By love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily 
With the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I cannot fall,
Listening every moment 
To the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Savior 
As my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God."
333;How Firm A Foundation;G;"How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said, 
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled?
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, I will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee and cause thee
     to stand,
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for  repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor
     to shake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"
334;Alone With God;F;"When storms of life are round 
     me beating.
When rough the path that I have trod,
Within my closet door retreating,
I love to be alone with God.

Chorus
Alone with God, the world forbidden.
Alone with God, Oh blest retreat!
Alone with God and in Him hidden,
To hold with Him communion sweet.

What tho' the clouds have 
    gathered o'er me?
What tho' I've passed beneath the rod?
God's perfect will there lies before me,
When I am thus alone with God.

'Tis there I find new strength for duty,
As o'er the sands of time I plod;
I see the King in all His beauty.
While resting there alone with God.

And when I see the moment nearing
When I shall sleep beneath the sod,
When time with me is disappearing,
I want to be alone with God."
335;Marching On;C;"Marching on in the light of God,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Up the path that the Master trod, 
Marching, marching on.

Chorus
A robe of white, a crown of gold,
A harp, a home, a mansion fair,
A victor's palm, a joy untold,
Are mine when I get there.

Marching on thro' the hosts of sin, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Vict'ry's mine, while I've Christ within,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on while the skeptics sneer, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Perfect love casteth out all fear,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on with the flag unfurled,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Preaching Christ to the dying world,
Marching, marching on."
336;To God be the Glory;Ab;"To God be the glory, 
Great things He hath done,
So loved He the world that 
He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life 
An atonement for sin,
And opened the Life Gate 
That all may go in.

CHORUS
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, 
Through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; 
Great things He hath done.

Oh, perfect redemption, 
The purchase of blood,
To every believer 
The promise of God;
The vilest offender 
Who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus 
A pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing 
Through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, 
And greater will be
Our wonder, our transport 
When Jesus we see."
337;Oh To Be Like Thee;C;"Oh to be like Thee, 
Blessed Redeemer,
This is my constant 
Longing and prayer;
Gladly I'll forfeit,
All of earth's treasures,
Jesus, Thy perfect 
Likeness to wear.

CHORUS
Oh to be like Thee,
Oh to be like Thee,
Blessed Redeemer, 
Pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, 
Come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image 
Deep on my heart.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Full of compassion,
Loving, forgiving, 
Tender and kind,
Helping the helpless, 
Cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wandering 
Sinner to find.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless, 
Patient and brave;
Meekly enduring 
Cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer, 
Others to save.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lord, I am coming,
Now to receive 
Th' anointing divine,
All that I am and have 
I am bringing,
Lord, from this moment 
All shall be Thine.

Oh to be like Thee, 
While I am pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit, 
Fill with Thy love,
Make me a temple 
Meet for Thy dwelling,
Fit me for life 
And heaven above."
338;Count Your Blessings;C;"When upon life's billows 
You are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged, 
Thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you 
What the Lord hath done.

CHORUS
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Count your blessings,
See what God hath done;
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Count your many blessings,
See what God hath done.

Are you ever burdened 
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing 
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised 
You His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings, 
Money cannot buy
Your reward in Heaven, 
Nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict, 
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, 
God is over all;
Count your many blessings, 
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you 
To your journey's end."
339;What A Friend;F;"What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there."
340;I Will Praise Him;C;"When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing,
When He said, Wilt thou be clean?

CHORUS
I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His blood has washed away 
     each stain.

Though the way seems straight 
     and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him,
Glory, glory to His name!

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in;
He's forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin."
341;Ho! Everyone that Is Thirsty;F;"Ho! ev'ry one that is thirsty in spirit,
Ho! ev'ry one that is weary and sad,
Come to the fountain, 
There's fullness in Jesus,
All that you're longing for, 
Come and be glad.

Chorus
""I will pour water on him 
    who is thirsty, 
I will pour floods upon 
     the dry ground;
Open your heart 
For the gift I am bringing,
While ye are seeking Me, 
I will be found.""

Child of the world, 
Are you tired of your bondage?
Weary of earth-joys,
So false, so untrue;
Thirsting for God, 
And his fullness of blessing?
List to the promise -- 
A message for you.

Child of the kingdom, 
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Nothing but fullness 
Thy longing can meet.
'Tis the enduement 
For life and for service;
Thine is the promise, 
So certain, so sweet."
342;Feasting With My Lord;F;"Since my soul is saved 
     and sanctified,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
In this land of Canaan I'll abide,
Feasting with my Lord.

CHORUS
Feasting, I am feasting,
Feasting with my Lord;
Feasting, I am feasting
On the living Word.

Feeding on the honey 
     and the wine,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Gathering the clusters 
     from the vine,
Feasting with my Lord.

Day by day we have 
     a new supply,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
And the food is never 
     stale nor dry,
Feasting with my Lord.

Many times we have 
     an extra spread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Then to deeper truths 
     I have been led,
Feasting with my Lord.

Often there are only 
     just us two,
Feasting I'm feasting
Then He tells me what 
     He'd have me do,
Feasting with my Lord.

If perchance the cupboard's
     scarce of bread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
On the hidden manna 
      I am fed,
Feasting with my Lord."
343;Oh Say, But I'm Glad;C;"There is a song in my heart today,
Something I never had;
Jesus has taken my sins away,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

CHORUS
Oh say, but I'm glad, I'm glad,
Oh say, but I'm glad;
Jesus has come 
And my cup's overrun;
Oh say but I'm glad.

Wonderful, marvelous 
Love He brings,
Into a heart that's sad;
Through darkest tunnels 
The soul just sings,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

We have a fellowship 
Rich and sweet,
Tongues can never relate;
Abiding in Him is a real treat,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

Won't you come to Him 
With all your care,
Weary and worn and sad?
You too, will sing 
As His love you share.
Oh say, but I'm glad."
344;The Comforter Has Come;C;"O spread the tidings 'round,
      wherever man is found,
Wherever human hearts
      and human woes abound;
Let ev'ry Christian tongue
      proclaim the joyful sound:
The Comforter has come!

Chorus
The Comforter has come, 
The Comforter has come!
The Holy Ghost from Heav'n, 
The Father's promise giv'n;
O spread the tidings 'round, 
     wherever man is found --
The Comforter has come!

The long, long night is past, 
     the morning breaks at last,
And hushed the dreadful wail 
     and fury of the blast,
As o'er the golden hills 
     the day advances fast!
The Comforter has come!

Lo, the great King of kings,
      with healing in His wings,
To ev'ry captive soul 
     a full deliv'rance brings;
And thro' the vacant cells
      the song of triumph rings;
The Comforter has come!

O boundless love divine! 
      how shall this tongue of mine 
To wond'ring mortals tell
      the matchless grace divine
That I, a child of hell,
      should in His image shine!
The Comforter has come!"
345;Trust And Obey;F;"When we walk with the Lord
In the Light of His Word
What a glory He sheds 
   on our way!
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will 
   trust and obey.

CHORUS
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To bring glory to Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly 
   drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we 
   trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth 
   richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we 
   trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will 
   trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side 
   in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey."
346;The Breaking of the Day;Eb;"'Tis almost time for the Lord to come, 
I hear the people say;
The stars of heav'n are growing dim:
It must be the breaking of the day.

Chorus
O, it must be the breaking of the day,
O, it must be the breaking of the day;
The night is almost gone,
The day is coming on:
O, it must be the breaking of the day.

The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
In earth and sea and sky,
Aloud proclaim to mortal men,
That the coming of the Master
     draweth nigh.

It must be time for the waiting church 
To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps
To look for the breaking of the day.

There must be those in the field of sin,
Far from the fold astray,
Who once were happy in Jesus' love,
And looking for the breaking of the day.

Go quickly out in the streets and lanes,
And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt and blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the day."
347;Faith Of Our Fathers! Living Still;G;"Faith of our fathers! living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
Oh how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word

CHORUS
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children's fate,
If they, like them, could die for Thee!

Faith of our fathers! we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, 
As love knows how,
By kindly words and virtuous life!"
348;Under His Wings;C;"Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Though the night deepens 
     and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him, 
I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, 
And I am His child.

CHORUS
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

Under His wings, 
What a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly 
Turns to His rest!
Often when earth has 
No balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, 
And there I am blest.

Under His wings, 
O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till 
Life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, 
No evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus 
I'm safe evermore."
349;Lead Me, Savior;C;"Savior lead me, lest I stray,
Gently lead me all the way;
I am safe when by Thy side, 
I would in Thy love abide.

Chorus
Lead me, lead me, Savior, 
lead me, lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me Savior, all the way.

Thou the refuge of my soul,
When life's stormy billows roll,
I am safe when Thou art nigh,
All my hopes on Thee rely.

Savior, lead me, then at last, 
When the storm of life is past,
To the land of endless day, 
Where all tears are wiped away."
350;I See A Crimson Stream;Ab;"On Calvary's hill of sorrow
Where sin's demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid.

CHORUS
I see a crimson stream of blood.
It flows from Calvary,
Its waves which reach 
     the throne of God,
Are sweeping over me.

Today no condemnation
Abides to turn away
My soul from His salvation,
He's in my heart to stay.

When gloom and sadness whisper
You've sinned, no use to pray,
I look away to Jesus,
And He tells me to say:

And when we reach the portal
Where life forever reigns,
The ransomed hosts grand final
Will be this glad refrain."
351;Like Zion's Holy Mount;C;"All they who put their trust in God
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount,
By many ages proved.

Chorus
Like the mount of God, 
Like the mount of God;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
By many ages proved.
They can never be removed, removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
They can never be removed.

As round about Jerusalem
The rugged mountains lie,
So round about His holy saints
Our God is ever nigh.

Tho' fierce the storm in fury beat
And awful thunders roar,
The children of the mighty God
Are safe forevermore.

Thus over-shadowed by His love,
Where harm can ne'er betide,
Within this refuge safe and sure
I ever would abide"
352;My Faith Looks Up To Thee;Eb;"My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Savior divine!
Now hear me while I pray,
Take all my sin away,
O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside."
353;Blessed Be The Name;Ab;"All praise to Him who reigns above,
In majesty supreme,
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem.

CHORUS
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

His name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father's own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.

His name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace;
Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man,
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,
For Thou hast died for all.

Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord;
Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord.

There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord;
There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord.

Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord;
Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord.

We baptize in the name, 
We baptize in the name,
We baptize in the name of the Lord;
We baptize in the name, 
We baptize in the name,
We baptize in the name of the Lord."
354;Joy Unspeakable;Ab;"I have found His grace 
Is all complete,
He supplieth every need;
While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet,
I am free, yes free indeed.

CHORUS
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Oh, the half has never yet been told.

I have found the pleasure 
I once craved,
It is joy and peace within;
What a wondrous blessing! 
I am saved
From the awful guilt of sin.

I have found that hope 
So bright and clear,
Living in the realm of grace;
Oh, the Savior's presence is so near,
I can see His smiling face.

I have found the joy 
No tongue can tell,
How its waves of glory roll!
It is like a great o'erflowing well,
Springing up within my soul."
355;Higher Ground;Ab;"I'm pressing on the 
     upward way,
New heights I'm gaining 
     every day;
Still praying as I'm 
     onward bound,
Lord, plant my feet on 
     higher ground.

CHORUS
Lord, lift me up and 
     let me stand,
By faith on Heaven's 
     table land,
A higher plane than 
     I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on 
     higher ground.

My heart has no 
     desire to stay
Where doubts arise and 
     fears dismay;
Tho' some may dwell 
     where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, 
     is higher ground.

I want to scale the 
     utmost height,
And catch a gleam 
     of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till heaven 
     I've found,
Lord, lead me on to 
     higher ground."
356;In the Twinkling of an Eye;Bb;"When the trump of the great archangel
Its mighty tones shall sound,
And, the end of the world proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of man shall come in His glory,
With all the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies 
     from the multitudes that rise,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Chorus
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
The trumpet shall sound, the dead 
     shall be raised,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

When He comes in the clouds descending,
And they who loved Him here,
From their graves shall awake and praise Him
With joy and not with fear;
When the body and the soul are united,
And clothed no more to die,
What a shouting there will be 
     when each other's face we see,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Oh the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in pow'r
And the songs of the blood-bought millions 
Shall hail that blissful hour;
When we gather safely home in the morning,
And night's dark shadows fly,
What a shouting on the shore
     when we meet to part no more,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye."
357;Break Thou The Bread Of Life;C;"Break Thou the bread of life,
Dear Lord to me,
As Thou didst break
The loaves beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page,
I seek Thee Lord;
My spirit pants for Thee,
Oh living Word!

Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord
To me, To me,
As Thou didst bless
The bread by Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My All in All.

Teach me to live, dear Lord,
Only for Thee,
As Thy disciples lived in Galilee;
Then, all my struggles o'er,
Then, victory won,
I shall behold Thee, Lord,
The living One."
358;Rock of Ages;Ab;"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Not the labor of my hands 
Can fulfill thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no despite know,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee."
359;Signs Are Everywhere;Bb;"The King is coming in glory 
To catch His bride away,
It may be in the morning  
It may be at mid-day, 
At the even or midnight; 
The trump will sound so clear,
The dead in Christ, and we that live,
His voice shall hear.

Chorus
The King is coming, hallelujah! 
He's coming in the air,
The fig tree is budding, 
The signs are everywhere,
The saints are looking ever up-ward
While jour'ning on their way, 
He's coming, hallelujah!
To catch his bride away.

Behold! He cometh, and leaping  
And skipping o'er the hills;
Like the young roe, like the young hart, 
My soul with rapture thrills; 
Thru the window He's looking,
Thru the lattice-work is seen, 
The winter's past, the rain is o'er, 
The figs are green.

The King is coming , ""Be ready,""  
To meet Him on that day;
With your heart right, 
     with your robes white,
And in this holy way;  
Like the light'ning that flashes
In the twinkling of an eye, 
Our Lord shall come to claim His own
He's drawing nigh."
360;I Remember Calvary;Eb;"Where He may lead me, I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him so,
And I remember 'twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

CHORUS
Jesus shall lead me night and day,
Jesus shall lead me all the way,
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

Oh, I delight in His command,
Love to be lead by His dear hand;
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.

Onward I go, no doubt, nor fear,
Happy with Christ my Savior near,
Trusting that I some day shall see,
Jesus, my Friend of Calvary."
361;Close To Thee;F;"Thou, my everlasting portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior let me walk with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior let me walk with Thee.

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Nor for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me through the 
   vale of shadows,
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee."
362;Cleanse Me;F;"Search me, Oh God, and 
   know my heart today;
Try me, Oh Savior, know 
   my thoughts, I pray:
See if there be some 
   wicked way in me:
Cleanse me from every sin, 
    and set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord, for 
   cleansing me from sin:
Fulfill Thy Word, and make 
   me pure within:
Fill me with fire where once 
   I burned with shame:
Grant my desire to magnify 
     Thy name.

Lord take my life, and make 
   it wholly Thine:
Fill my poor heart with 
   Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, 
     self and pride;
I now surrender: Lord in 
   me abide.

Oh, Holy Ghost, revival 
   comes from Thee:
Send a revival, 
   start the work in me:
Thy Word declares, 
   Thou wilt supply our need:
For blessing now, Oh Lord, 
     I humbly plead."
363;He Rolled the Sea Away;C;"When Israel out of bondage came,
A sea before them lay;
The Lord reach'd down 
    His mighty hand,
And rolled the sea away.

Chorus
Then forward still, 
    'tis Jehovah's will, 
Tho' the billows dash and spray,
With a conq'ring tread 
    we will push ahead
He'll roll the sea away.

Before me was a sea of sin,
So great I feared to pray;
My heart's desire the Savior read,
And rolled the sea away.

When sorrows dark, like stormy waves,
Were dashing o'er my way,
Again the Lord in mercy came, 
And rolled the sea away.

And when I reach the sea of death,
For needed grace I'll pray;
I know the Lord will quickly come,
And roll the sea away."
364;Oh That Will Be Glory;F;"When all my labors and trials are o'er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

CHORUS
Oh that will be glory for me,
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace 
I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.

When by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in Heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Friends will be there 
I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Savior, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me."
365;We'll Understand It Better By And By;F;"We are often tossed and driven
On the restless sea of time,
Somber skies and howling tempests
Oft succeed a bright sunshine,
In that land of perfect day,
When the mists have rolled away,
We will understand it 
   better by and by.

CHORUS
By and by when the morning comes,
When the saints of God 
   are gathered home,
We will tell the story 
   how we've overcome;
For we'll understand it 
   better by and by.

We are often destitute
Of the things that life demands,
Want of food, want of shelter,
Thirsty hills and barren lands,
We are trusting in the Lord,
And according to His Word,
We will understand it 
   better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares
Often take us unawares,
And our hearts are made to bleed
For many thoughtless word or deed,
And we wonder why the test
When we try to do our best,
But we'll understand it 
    better by and by."
366;He Was Nailed To The Cross For Me;Eb;"What a wonderful, wonderful Savior,
Who would die on the cross for me!
Freely shedding His 
   precious life blood,
That the sinner might be made free.

CHORUS
He was nailed to the cross for me,
He was nailed to the cross for me;
On the cross crucified, 
   for me He died;
He was nailed to the cross for me.

Thus He left His heavenly glory
To accomplish His Father's plan;
He was born of the Virgin Mary,
Took upon Him the form of man.

He was wounded  for 
   our transgressions,
And He carried our sorrows, too;
He's the Healer of every sickness,
This He came to the world to do.

So He gave His life for others
In redeeming this world from sin,
And He's gone to prepare 
   a mansion,
That at last we may enter in."
367;Redeemed;Ab;"Redeemed how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
Redeemed through His infinite mercy
His child and forever, I am.

CHORUS
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps
And giveth me songs in the night.

I know there's a crown that is waiting
In yonder bright mansions for me,
And soon with the spirits made perfect
At home with the Lord I shall be."
368;God Leads Us Along;Eb;"In shady green pastures, 
     so rich and sweet,
God leads His dear 
   children along;
Where the water's cool flow 
Bathes the weary one's feet,
God leads His dear 
   children along.

CHORUS
Some thro' the waters, 
Some thro' the flood,
Some thro' the fire, 
But all thro' the blood;
Some thro' great sorrow, 
But God gives a song;
In the night season 
And all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount 
Where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear 
   children along;
Sometimes in the valley 
In the darkest of night,
God leads His dear 
   children along.

Tho' sorrows befall us, 
And Satan oppose,
God leads His dear 
   children along;
Through grace we can conquer, 
Defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear 
   children along.

Away from the mire, 
And away from the clay,
God leads His dear 
   children along;
Away up in glory, eternity's day.
God leads His dear 
   children along."
369;He Brought Me Out;C;"My heart was distressed 
'Neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins 
Dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord 
From the deep, miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out 
     to golden day.

CHORUS
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah.

He placed me upon 
The strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established 
     and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling 
While here I remain,
But stand by His grace 
Until the crown I gain.

He gave me a song, 
'Twas a new song of praise,
By day and by night 
Its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing, 
I'm happy and free,
I'll praise my Redeemer, 
Who has rescued me.

I'll sing of His wonderful 
     mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men 
His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation 
At home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth 
And trust in God.

I'll tell of the pit, 
With its gloom and despair,
I'll praise the dear Father, 
Who answered my prayer;
I'll sing my new song, 
The glad story of love,
Then join in the chorus 
With the saints above."
370;Beneath The Cross Of Jesus;C;"Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the 
     noonday heat,
And the burden of the day.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart 
     with tears,
Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love
And my own worthlessness.

I take, Oh cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross."
371;Like a Mighty Sea;F;"My soul today is thirsting 
     for living streams divine,
To sweep from highest heaven 
     to this poor heart of mine;
I stand upon the promise, 
     in Jesus' name I plead;
Oh send the gracious current
     to satisfy my need.

Chorus
Like a mighty sea,
      like a mighty sea,
Comes the love of Jesus, 
     sweeping over me;
The waves of glory roll,
     the Savior to extol,
Comes the love of Jesus,
     sweeping o'er my soul.

I see the clouds arising,
     the mercy clouds of love,
That come to bring refreshing
   down from the throne above,
The earnest of the shower,
     just now to us is giv'n,
And now we wait, expecting 
     the floods of grace from heav'n.

The show'rs of grace are falling,
     the tide is rolling in,
The flood-tide of salvation,
     with pow'r to cleanse from sin;
It's surging thro' my being 
     and takes my sin away,
It keeps me shouting glory!
     thro' all the happy day.

It's coming, yes, it's coming,
     it's coming down this hour,
A torrent of salvation  
     in saving cleansing pow'r.
I hear the billows surging,
     I see them mount and roll;
Oh glory, hallelujah!
     they're sweeping thro' my soul."
372;Glory To His Name;F;"Down at the cross 
Where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing 
From sin I cried;
There to my heart 
Was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

CHORUS
Glory to His name!
Glory to His name!
There to my heart 
Was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

I am so wondrously 
Saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly 
Abides within,
There at the cross 
Where He took me in;
Glory to His name!

Oh, precious fountain 
That saves from sin!
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me 
And keeps me clean;
Glory to His name!

Come to this fountain 
So rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul 
At the Savior's feet;
Plunge in today 
And be made complete;
Glory to His name!"
373;It Is Mine;Bb;"God's abiding peace 
Is in my soul today,
Yes, I feel it now,
Yes, I feel it now;
He has taken all my 
Doubts and fears away,
Though I cannot tell you how.

CHORUS
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
He has given peace, 
Perfect peace to me;
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
Mine for all eternity!

He has wrought in me 
A sweet and perfect rest,
In my raptured heart 
I can feel it now;
He each passing moment 
Keeps me saved and blest,
Floods with light 
My heart and brow.

He has given me 
A never failing joy,
Oh, I have it now! 
Oh, I have it now!
To His praise I will my 
Ransomed pow'rs employ,
And renew my grateful vow.

Oh, the love of God 
Is comforting my soul,
For His love is mine, 
Yes, His love is mine!
Waves of joy and gladness 
O'er my spirit roll,
Thrilling me with life divine."
374;Builded on the Rock;F;"I builded on the Rock,
On the Rock of God,
Builded on the Rock,Christ Jesus;
I dug down deep 
And builded on the Rock,
Builded on the Rock of God.

Chorus
I hold not the Rock,
But the Rock holds me
The Rock holds me, 
The Rock holds me;
I rest on the Rock,
And the Rock holds me,
Resting on the Rock of God.

Why should I fear 
When the winds sweep by?
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Or shaken be when 
The waves roll high?
Builded on the Rock of God.

Hush, raging billows at His command, 
Builded of the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Oh, peace be still 'neath 
His loving hand!
Builded on the Rock of God.

Praise God for our foundation sure! 
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
No storms can harm our house secure,
Builded on the Rock of God."
375;At Calvary;C;"Years I spent in 
     vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord
     was crucified,
Knowing not it was 
     for me He died
On Calvary.

CHORUS
Mercy there was great, 
     and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied 
     to me;
There my burdened soul 
     found liberty,
At Calvary.

By God's Word at last
     my sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law 
     I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring 
     turned
To Calvary.

Now I've giv'n to Jesus 
     everything,
Now I gladly own Him as 
     my King,
Now my raptured soul can 
     only sing
Of Calvary.

Oh, the love that drew 
     salvation's plan!
Oh, the grace that brought 
      it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that 
     God did span
At Calvary!"
376;My Burdens Rolled Away;F;"I remember when my burdens 
     rolled away,
I had carried them for years, 
Night and day;
When I sought the blessed Lord, 
And I took Him at His Word,
Then at once all 
My burdens rolled away.

CHORUS
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away;
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away.

I remember when 
My burdens rolled away,
That I feared would never leave 
Night or day;
Jesus showed to me the loss, 
So I left them at the cross,
I was glad when 
My burdens rolled away.

I am singing since 
My burdens rolled away,
There's a song within my heart 
Night and day;
I am living for my King, 
And with joy I shout and sing
Hallelujah! all 
My burdens rolled away."
377;Bring Them In;F;"Hark, 'tis the Shepherd's 
   voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who've 
   gone astray
Far from the Shepherd's 
   fold away.

CHORUS
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring the little ones to Jesus.

Who'll go and help this 
   Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wandering 
   ones to find?
Who'll bring the lost 
   ones the fold,
Where they'll be sheltered 
   from the cold?

Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountains 
   wild and high,
Hark! 'tis the Master 
   speaks to thee,
""Go find My sheep 
   where'er they be."""
378;Jesus Paid It All;Eb;"I hear the Savior say,
""Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, 
watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.""

CHORUS
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.

Since nothing good have  I,
Whereby Thy grace to claim,
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb"
379;Friendship With Jesus;C;"A friend of Jesus, oh, what bliss
That one so weak as I
Should ever have a friend 
     like this
To lead me to the sky.

CHORUS
Friendship with Jesus,
Fellowship divine;
Oh, what blessed sweet 
     communion,
Jesus is a friend of mine.

A friend when other friendships 
      cease,
A friend when others fail;
A friend who gives me joy 
     and peace,
A friend who will prevail.

A friend to lead me in the dark,
A friend who knows the way;
A friend to steer my weak, 
     frail bark,
A friend my debts to pay.

A friend when sickness lays 
     me low,
A friend when death draws near;
A friend as through the vale I go,
A friend to help and cheer.

A friend when life's rough 
     voyage is o'er.
A friend when death is past;
A friend to greet on heaven's 
     shore,
A friend when home at last."
380;A Glorious Church;C;"Do you hear them coming, brother,
Thronging up the steeps of light,
Clad in glorious shining garments,
Bloodwashed, garments pure 
      and white?

CHORUS
'Tis a glorious church 
Without spot or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb;
'Tis a glorious church 
Without spot or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb;

Do you hear the

And day by day
They abide in the fold
And go not astray;
They love me because
I have made them my choice

My sheep know my voice
And the pastures of green
Where I lead them so often to feed;
My sheep know my voice and the
     cool sparkling stream
Where beside its still waters I lead.

For I will be with them alway."

By suffering saints here below.
Jesus is coming to banish our sorrow,
And lead us where tears never flow.

Come, dear Lord Jesus. 
Thy promise fulfilling;
""Come quickly!"" our souls cry to Thee:
Long has the world been enthralled 
     by the tempter,
The curse is on land and on sea.
Yet Thou shalt triumph, the nations subduing,
The truth of the Word cannot fail;
God's wondrous glory, like ocean's deep billows,
To earth's farthest bounds shall prevail."

Hear the trumpet blow!

In the new Jerusalem.

Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown,
And when the battle's over
We shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

Must I be carried to the skies,
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed the bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?

Sure, I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord:
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word."

He took my sins away.

No condemnation 
Have I in my heart,
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.
His perfect peace 
He did to me impart,
He took my sins away.

If you will come 
To Jesus Christ today,
He'll take your sins away,

And keep you happy 
In His love each day,
He'll take your sins away."

Echoes of mercy, 
Whispers of love.

Am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, 
Looking above,
Filled with His goodness, 
Lost in His love."

Tell the world the story,
How His blood will save them
From their awful fate.

Chorus
Jesus opened up 
The way to heaven's gate
When He died on the cross
To redeem all the lost;
He prepared the road 
That leads to His abode,
'Tis a road, marked by blood
But it leads us home to God.

And the way is marked
By the foot-prints of the Savior,
With His blood He made it,
Made it plain and straight;
If you walk that way,
It will lead you into heaven,
Lead you safely into 
Glory's golden gate.

Sinner, will you come and join
      in this heav'nly journey,
Walk the bloody pathway 
That the Savior trod;
Then when life is over 
And all the sheaves are garnered,
You will meet the Savior 
     and be not afraid."
394;Master, the Tempest Is Raging;C;"Master, the tempest is raging! 
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o'er-shadowed with blackness,

How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

Chorus

Peace, be still!""

Or demons or men or whatever it be,

The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, be still! Peace be still! 
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, peace, be still!

Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
O waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul!
And I perish! I perish, dear Master; 
O hasten and take control!

Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast.
Linger, O blessed Redeemer, 
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
And rest on the blissful shore."

To restore a world 
To happiness and God;

The bleeding sacrifice 
Who for Adam's race 
Paid such a fearful price;

The Paschal Lamb of God,
For the world received 
""Redemption thro' His blood.""

""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
Let men and angels sing, 
""Worthy is the Lamb,""

And when life is past, 
Upon the golden shore,
""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
We'll shout forevermore."

Consecrate me now, 
    to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up 
    with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of 
   a single hour,
That before Thy 
   throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer, 
    and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend 
   with friend!

There are depths of love

Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy

Till I rest in peace with Thee."

And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than the snow,
Whiter than the snow;
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o'ercame;
Grievous were the sorrows he bore,
But He suffered thus not in vain.
May I to that fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below;
Wash me in the blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me-
Water cannot wash them away.

Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."

Chorus
Launch out into the deep,
Oh, let the shoreline go,
Launch out, launch out in the
     ocean divine,
Out where the full tides flow.

But many, alas! only stand 
    on the shore
And gaze on the ocean so wide;
They never have ventured its 
    depths to explore,
Or to launch on the fathomless tide.

And others just venture away 
    from the land,
And linger so near to the shore,
That the surf and the slime
      that beat over the strand,
Dash o'er them in floods evermore.


Oh,let us launch out on this
     ocean so broad,
Where the floods of salvation e'er flow;
Oh, let us be lost in the mercy of God,
Till the depths of His fullness we know."

What! never thirst again? 
No, never thirst again,
For he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

The keener thirst endure.

This stream from Calvary still flows,
To bless and cleanse and heal,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
New life and rest shall feel.

Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried

   of my troubles;
He is a kind, 
   compassionate Friend;
If I but ask Him,

Make of my troubles

Tempted and tried I 
   need a great Savior,
One who can help my 
   burdens to bear;
I must tell Jesus, 
   I must tell Jesus;
He all my cares and 
   sorrows will share.

Oh how the world to 
   evil allures me!
Oh how my heart is 
   tempted to sin!
I must tell Jesus, 
   and He will help me
Over the world 
   the vict'ry to win."

Sometimes where Eden's 
     bowers bloom,
By waters still, 
O'er troubled sea,
Still 'tis His hand 
That leadeth me!

Lord, I would clasp 
Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content, whatever lot I see, 
Since 'tis my God 
That leadeth me!

And when my task 
On earth is done,
When, by Thy grace, 
The victry's won,
E'en death's cold wave 
I will not flee,
Since God thro' Jordan 
     leadeth me."

And beyond I see the haven I desire;
There I view the beacon lights of home,
And my soul is burning with the fire."

He's fairer than the lily, 
      brighter than the morning star;
He fills and satisfies
      my longing spirit o'er and o'er;
Each day He grows still sweeter 
      than He was the day before.

My heart is sometimes heavy,
      but He comes with sweet relief;
He folds me to His bosom 
      when I droop with blighting grief;
I love the Christ who all my burdens
      in His body bore;
Each day He grows still sweeter 
      than He was the day before."

To our fathers who were true;
This is promised to believers,
And we all may have it, too."

My Savior stands between;
He stands to shield me from danger,
When earthly friends are gone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

When in affliction's valley
I'm treading the road of care;
My Savior helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet, entangled with briars
Ready to cast me down,
My Savior whispers His promise, 
""I never will leave thee alone.""

He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side;
For me He opened the fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He's waiting in glory,
Seated upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone."

Strong and mighty tower;
I have all for Him forsaken, 
And all my idols torn from my heart, 
And now He keeps me by His power.
Though all the world forsake me, 
And Satan tempts me sore,
Through Jesus I shall 
Safely reach the goal;

He will never, never leave me, 
Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith 
And do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, 
I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He 
My hungry soul shall fill.
Then sweeping up to glory, 
To see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll!"

Wonderful story of love; 
For all the pure and blest,
Rest in those mansions above us,
With those who've gone on before us,
Singing the rapturous chorus,

Help me ring the Savior's praises

With her dazzle and her dreams,
Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,
For my soul looks up to heaven 
Where the golden sunlight gleams,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Not for all earth's golden millions
Would I leave this precious place,
Tho' the tempter to persuade me 
     oft has tried,
For I'm safe in God's pavilion,
Happy in His love and grace,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Here the sun is always shining,
Here the sky is always bright;
'Tis no place for gloomy 
     Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music 
And my heart with great delight,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

And upon the streets of Glory, 
When we reach the other shore,
And have safely crossed the Jordan's 
     rolling tide,
You will find me shouting ""Glory"" 
Just outside my mansion door,
Where I'm living on the hallelujah side."

Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading 
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided, 
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never 
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, 
Which can never fail.

Onward, then ye people! 
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honor, 
Unto Christ the King;
This thro' countless ages 
Men and angels sing."

Met the giant on the field all alone;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He knew what God had said,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Daniel prayed unto the Lord 
     thrice each day,
Then unto the lion's den led the way;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He did not fear or dread,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Often with the carnal mind I was tried,
Asking for deliverance oft I cried;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I reckoned I was dead,
By faith I saw the victory ahead.

When like those who've gone before 
     to that land,
By death's river cold and dark 
     I shall stand;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I will not fear or dread,
By faith I see the victory ahead."

I'll go where you want me to go , dear Lord
O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;

Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand'rer whom I should seek,
Oh Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide, 
Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I'll say what you want me to say.

There's surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth's harvest-fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life's short day
For Jesus, the Crucified.
So, trusting my all unto Thy care, 
I know Thou lovest me!
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what you want me to be."

Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."

Why do you tarry, 
Why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; 
Oh hasten today
And out with the Life-Boat! 
Away, then, away!

Throw out the Life-Line 
To danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish 
Where you've never been;
Winds of temptation 
And billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out 
Where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season 
Of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift 
To eternity's shore;
Haste then,my brother, 
No time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line 
And save them today."

To Zion then with joy,
And in all His holy mountain 
Nothing hurts or shall destroy;
Perfect peace shall reign in every heart,
     and love without alloy,
After Jesus shall come back 
     to earth again.

Then the sin and sorrow, pain and death
     of  this dark world shall cease,
In a glorious reign with Jesus of a

For that day of sweet release,
For our Jesus to come back

Under the precious blood.

The sinner's refuge here alone,
Under the blood, under the blood;
Here Jesus makes salvation known,
Under the precious blood.

Lord, with Thy self my spirit fill,
Under the blood, under the blood;
And work in me to do Thy will,
Under the precious blood.

Sweet peace abides within the heart,
Under the blood ,under the blood;
And gifts divine their joy impart,
Under the precious blood.

The Holy Spirit, hour by hour,
Under the blood, under the blood;
Exerts His sanctifying power,
Under the precious blood."
436;The Message of His Coming;Bb;"We're looking for His coming,
      in the clouds of heaven,
Coming back to earth 
      to catch away His own;
Then may we all be ready, 
      when midnight cry is given,
To go and reign with Christ 
      on His throne.

Chorus
Gladly may we herald the message 
Of His blessed appearing,
Soon He's coming in glory, 
Tell to one and all;
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, 
Why slumber when the end is nearing,
But get ready for the final call.

We're longing for the glory 
     that awaits the faithful,
Who shall overcome, 
     and ev'ry conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward, 
     the prize is life eternal
To all who win the fight over sin.

We're praying for the advent 
      of our blessed Savior,
Who has promised life 
      to all who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending, 
      the message being given,
And soon we'll see our Lord 
      face to face.

We see the signs appearing 
      of His blessed coming,
Lo, behold the fig leaves 
      now becoming green;
The gospel of His kingdom 
      has gone to ev'ry nation;
That we are near the end 
      can be seen."
437;Wonderful Words Of Life;F;"Sing them over again to me,

   the heart of God,
Wonderful words of Life!
Words that speak of the 
   cleansing blood,
Wonderful words of Life!
Words of life and glory
Tell the wondrous story."
438;Yes, I Know!;F;"Come, ye sinners, lost and hopeless,
Jesus' blood can make you free;
For He saved the worst among you,
When He saved a wretch like me.

CHORUS
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' blood can make the 
     vilest sinner clean.
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' blood can make the 
     vilest sinner clean.

To the faint He giveth power,
Through the mountains makes a way;
Findeth water in the desert,
Turns the night to golden day.

In temptation He is near thee,
Holds the powers of hell at bay;
Guides you to the path of safety,
Gives you grace for every day.

He will keep thee while the ages
Roll throughout eternity;
Though earth hinders and hell rages,
All must work for good to thee."
439;Hiding In Thee;Eb;"Oh safe to the Rock
That is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts
And sorrows would fly;
So sinful, so weary, Thine,
Thine would I be;
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

CHORUS
Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Oh blessed Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noontide,
In sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation
Casts o'er me its power;
In the tempests of life,
On its wide heaving sea,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict,
When pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and
Breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials
Like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee,
Oh Thou Rock of my soul."
440;My Savior's Love;F;"I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.

CHORUS
How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!

For me it was in the garden
He prayed, ""Not My will, but Thine,""
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me."
441;Tell Me The Old, Old Story;C;"Tell me the old,  old story 
Of unseen things above;
Of Jesus and His glory,  
Of Jesus and His love.
Tell me the story simply, 
As to a little child,
For I am weak and weary, 
And helpless and defiled.

CHORUS
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story softly, 
That I may take it in,
That wonderful redemption,  
God's remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often, 
For I forget so soon,
The early dew of morning, 
Has passed away at noon.

Tell me the same old story 
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory 
Is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world's glory 
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell  me the old, old story: 
Christ Jesus makes thee whole."

A place of honor is reserved

Come, while He waits 
To welcome thee;
Delay not while this day is thine,
Tomorrow may never be.

Leave ev'ry care and 
     worldly strife;
Come, feast upon the love of God,
And drink everlasting life."
443;I've Anchored In Jesus;Ab;"Upon life's boundless ocean 
Where mighty billows roll,
I've fixed my hope in Jesus, 
Blest anchor of my soul;
When trials fierce assail me 
As storms are gathering o'er,
I rest upon His mercy 
And trust Him more.

CHORUS
I've anchored in Jesus, 
The storms of life I'll brave,
I've anchored in Jesus, 
I fear no wind or wave,
I've anchored in Jesus, 
For He hath power to save,
I've anchored to the Rock of Ages.

He keeps my soul from evil 
And gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters 
And bid their tumult cease;
My pilot and deliverer, 
To Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him, 
He's at my side,

He is my Friend and Savior, 
In Him my anchor's cast,
He drives away my sorrows 
And shields me from the blast;
By faith I'm looking upward 
Beyond life's troubled sea,
There I behold a haven 
Prepared for me."
444;My Redeemer;Ab;"I will sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

CHORUS
Sing, oh, sing, of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell

I will sing of my  Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be."
445;Let The Lower Lights Be Burning;Ab;"Brightly beams our Father's mercy
From His lighthouse evermore,
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.

CHORUS
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave!
Some poor fainting, struggling sea-man
You may rescue, you may save.

Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;
Some poor sailor tempest tossed,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost."
446;The Sure Foundation;F;"There stands a Rock on shores of time
That rears to heav'n its head sublime;
That Rock is cleft, and they are blest
Who find within this cleft a rest.

Chorus
Some build their hopes on the 
     ever drifting sand,
Some on their fame, or their treasure, 
     or their land;
Mine's on a Rock that forever will stand,
Jesus, the ""Rock of Ages.""

That Rock's a cross, its arms outspread,
Celestial glory bathes its head;
To its firm base my all I bring,
And to the Rock of Ages cling.

That Rock's a tow'r, whose lofty height,
Illum'd with heav'n's unclouded light,
Opes wide its gate beneath the dome
Where saints find rest with Christ at home."
447;Wonderful Peace;Ab;"Far away in the depths 
Of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody 
Sweeter than psalm;
In celestial like strains 
It unceasingly falls
O'er my soul 
Like an infinite calm.

CHORUS
Peace! peace! wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray
In fathomless billows of love.

What a treasure I have 
In this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul;
So secure that no power 
Can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll.

I am resting tonight 
In this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus' control;
For I'm kept from all danger 
By night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul.

And me thinks when I rise 
To that city of peace,
Where the author of peace 
I shall see,
That one strain of the song 
Which the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom shall be:

Ah! soul, are you here 
Without comfort or rest,
Marching down the rough 
Pathway of time?
Make Jesus your friend 
Ere the shadows grow dark;
Oh, accept this sweet 
Peace so sublime."
448;'Tis Burning In My Soul;C;"God sent His mighty power 
    to this poor, sinful heart,
To keep me every hour, 
    and needful grace impart;
And since His Spirit came, 
    to take supreme control,
The love enkindled flame 
    is burning in my soul.

CHORUS
'Tis burning in my soul, 
    'tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heavenly love 
    is burning in my soul,
The Holy Spirit came, 
    all glory to His name!
The fire of heavenly love 
    is burning in my soul.

Before the cross I bow, 
    upon the altar lay
A willing offering now, 
    my all from day to day.
My Savior paid the price,  
    my name He sweetly calls;
Upon the sacrifice the fire 
    from heaven falls.

No good that I have done, 
    His promise I embrace;
Accepted in the Son, 
    He saves me by His grace.
All glory be to God! 
    let hallelujahs roll;
His love is shed abroad, 
    the fire is in my soul."
449;Leaning On The Everlasting Arms;F;"What a fellowship, 
What a joy divine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms
What a blessedness, 
What a peace is mine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms

Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms

Oh, how sweet to walk 
In this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms
Oh, how bright the path 
Grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms

What have I to dread, 
What have I to fear,
Leaning on the everlasting arms
I have blessed peace 
With my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms"

Jesus full salvation brought,
Victory, victory.

Jesus gives me victory.
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He is all in all to me.

I am trusting in the Lord,
I am standing on His word,
Victory, victory.
I have peace and joy within,
Since my life is free from sin,
Victory, victory.

Shout your freedom everywhere,
His eternal peace declare,
Victory, victory.
Let us sing it here below,
In the face of every foe,
Victory, victory.

We will sing it on that shore,
When this fleeting life is o'er,
Victory, victory.
Sing it here, ye ransomed throng,
Start the everlasting song:
Victory, victory."
451;His Yoke Is Easy;Ab;"The Lord is my Shepherd, 
I shall not want,
He maketh me down to lie
In pastures green, 
He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

CHORUS
His yoke is easy, 
His burden is light,
I've found it so, 
I've found it so;
He leadeth me 
By day and by night,
Where living waters flow.

My soul crieth out: 
""Restore me again,
And give me 
The strength to take
The narrow path 
     of righteousness,
E'en for Thine own 
     name's sake.""

Yea, though I should walk 
The valley of death,
Yet what should I fear from ill?
For Thou art with me and 
Thy rod and staff support me still."
452;Jesus Loves Even Me;F;"I am so glad that 
Our Father in heav'n
Tells of His love in the Book 
He has giv'n,
Wonderful things 
In the Bible I see;
This is the dearest 
That Jesus loves me.

CHORUS
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me:
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

Tho' I forget Him 
And wander away,
Still He doth love me 
Wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving 
Arms would I flee,
When I remember 
That Jesus loves me.

Oh, if there's only one 
Song I can sing,
When in His beauty 
I see the  great King,
This shall my song 
In eternity be:
""Oh, what a wonder 
That Jesus loves me.""

Jesus loves me,
And I know I love Him;
Love brought Him down
My poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was love made 
Him die on the tree;
Oh, I am certain that 
Jesus loves me!

If one should ask of me, 
How can I tell?
Glory to Jesus, 
I know very well!
God's Holy Spirit 
With mine doth agree,
Constantly witnessing 
Jesus loves me.

In this assurance 
I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus, 
I know I am blessed;
Satan, dismayed, from my 
Soul now doth flee,
When I just tell him that
Jesus loves me."
453;Beautiful;Bb;"Beautiful robes so white,

Beautiful robes, beautiful land, 
Beautiful home, beautiful band,
Beautiful crown, shining so fair,
Beautiful mansion bright,
Gather us there.

Beautiful tho't to me,
We shall forever be 
Thine in eternity,
When from this world we're free;
Free from its toil and care,
Heavenly joys to share,
Let me cross over there;
This is my pray'r.

Beautiful things on high,
Over in yonder sky,
Thus I shall leave this shore,
Counting my treasures o'er;
Where we shall never die,
Carry me by and by,
Never to sorrow more,
Heavenly shore."
454;Sitting At The Feet Of Jesus;F;"Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
O what words I hear him say!
Happy place! so near, so precious!
May it find me there each day;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
I would look upon the past;
For His love has been so gracious,
It has won my heart at last.

Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Where can mortal be more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And, when weary, find sweet rest;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
There I love to weep and pray,
While I from his fullness gather
Grace and comfort every day.

Bless me, oh my Savior, bless me,
As I sit low at Thy feet;
Oh look down in love upon me,
Let me see Thy face so sweet,
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
Make me holy as He is;
May I prove I've been with Jesus,
Who is all my righteousness."

Oh! praise the Lord, it cleanseth me,
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me!

I see the new creation rise,
I hear the speaking blood,
It speaks! polluted nature dies!
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

I rise to walk in heav'n's own light
Above the world and sin,
With heart made pure, and 
     garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

Amazing grace! 'tis heav'n below
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus know,
My Jesus crucified."

Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

CHORUS
Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

For my pardon this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my cleansing, this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Now by this I'll overcome
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Now by this I'll reach my home
Nothing but the blood of Jesus."

CHORUS
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I have passed the riven veil,
Where the glories never fail,

I am living in the presence 
     of the King.

I'm a king and priest to God,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
By the cleansing of the blood,
Oh glory be to God!
By the Spirit's pow'r and light,
I am living day and night,
In the holiest place so bright,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I have passed the outer veil,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
Which did once God's light conceal,
Oh glory be to God!
But the blood has brought me in
To God's holiness so clean,
Where there's death to self and sin,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I'm within the holiest pale,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the inner veil,
Oh glory be to God!
I am sanctified to God
By the power of the blood,
Now the Lord is my abode,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!"
458;Amazing Grace;F;"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed;

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

Praise God, Praise God
    Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Praise God, 
    Praise God.
Praise God, Praise God

459;At The Cross;Eb;"Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

CHORUS
At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light,
And the burdens of my heart, 
     rolled away,
It was there by faith, 
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day.

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
Tis all that I can do!"
460;Come Unto Me;C;"Hear the blessed Savior

Hear Me and be blest;
I am meek and lowly,
Come and trust My might;
Come, My yoke is easy,
And My burden's light.

Are you disappointed, 
      wand'ring here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt 
      and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle
      in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus, 
He will give you rest.

Stumbling on the mountains 
      dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling tow'rd the pit
      of hell's consuming flame,
By the pow'rs of sin 
      deluded and oppressed, 
Hear the tender Shepherd,
""Come to Me and rest.""

Have you by temptation 
      often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness 
      brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you, 
      if you'll claim His best,
In the Holy Spirit, 
He will give you rest."

And go with me, with me

462;I Know Whom I Have Believed;C;"I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

CHORUS
But I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day.

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus thro' the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air."

I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow;
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow.

In coming, my sin I deplore,
My weakness and poverty show;
I long to be saved evermore,
To be washed and made 
     whiter than snow.

To Jesus I give up my all,
Every treasure and idol I know;
For His fullness of blessing I call,
Till His blood washes 
     whiter than snow"
464;Sweet By And By;F;"There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;

In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that 
   hallow our days."
465;When I Survey;F;"When I survey the wondrous cross,
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

His dying crimson like a robe
Spreads o'er His body on the tree;
Then am I dead to all the world,
And all the world is dead to me.

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all."
466;The Great Physician;Eb;"The great Physician now is near;
The sympathizing Jesus.
He speaks the drooping 
   heart to cheer,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus.

CHORUS
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

Your many sins are all forgiv'n,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace 
   to heav'n,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

All glory to the risen Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed 
   Savior's name,
I love the name of Jesus.

His name dispels my 
   guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus,
Oh, how my soul delights 
   to hear,
The charming name of Jesus."
467;Oh Happy Day;F;"Oh happy day that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Savior and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice
And tell its raptures all abroad.

CHORUS
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray
And live rejoicing every day
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away.

'Tis done, the great transaction's done
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;
He drew me, and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

Now rest, my long-divided heart;
Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
Nor ever from my Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed.

High heaven that heard the solemn vow
That vow renewed shall daily hear,
Till in life's latest hour I bow,
And bless in death a bond so dear!"
468;The Old Account Settled;Ab;"There was a time on earth, 
When in the book of heaven
An old account was standing
For sins yet unforgiven;
My name was at the top, 
And many things below,
I went unto the keeper, 
And settled long ago.

CHORUS
Long ago, long ago, 
Yes the old account 
Was settled long ago;
And the record's clear today, 
For He washed my sins away,
When the old account 
Was settled long ago.

The old account was large, 
And growing every day,
For I was always sinning, 
And never tried to pay;
But when I looked ahead, 
And saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle,
I settled long ago.

When at the judgment bar, 
I stand before my King,
And He the book will open, 
He cannot find a thing;
Then will my heart be glad, 
While tears of joy will flow
Because I had it settled, 
And settled long ago.

When in that happy home, 
My Savior's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story, 
And praise Him for His love;
I'll not forget that book, 
With pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled, 
And settled long ago.

O sinner, seek the Lord, 
Repent of all your sin,
For thus He hath commanded, 
If you would enter in;
And then if you should live 
A hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it, 
You settled long ago."
469;Stand Up For Jesus;G;"Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
   ye soldiers of the cross,
Lift high His royal banner, 
   it must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory, 
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished 
   and Christ is Lord  indeed.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
   the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict, 
   in this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him, 
   against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, 
   and strength to strength oppose.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus; 
   stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you - 
   ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor, 
   and watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger, 
   be never wanting there."
470;Yesterday, Today, Forever;Ab;"Oh, how sweet the glorious message, 
     simple faith may claim;
Yesterday today, forever,
 Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful, 
     heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest; 
     Glory to His name!

CHORUS
Yesterday, today, forever, 
Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never! 
     Glory to His name,
Glory to His name, Glory to His name;
All may change but Jesus never! 
     Glory to His name.

He who was the friend of sinners, 
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at 
His footstool penitently bow.
He who said, ""I'll not condemn thee, 
     go and sin no more;""
Speaks to thee that word of pardon, 
     as in days of yore.

Oft on earth He healed the sufferer 
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows 
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue, 
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His fullness 
Still will give as much.

He who pardoned erring Peter,
Never needs't thou fear;
He that came to faithless Thomas,
All thy doubt will clear
He who let the loved disciple
On His bosom rest,
Bids thee still, with love as tender,
Lean upon His breast

He who 'mid the raging billows,
Walked upon the sea;
Still can hush our wildest tempest,
As on Galilee
He who wept and prayed in anguish
In Gethsemane,
Drinks with us each cup of trembling
In our agony

As of old He walked to Emmaus, 
      with them to abide;
So through all life's way He walketh, 
      ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him, 
     hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be this same Jesus, 
     as He went away."
471;Revive Us Again;F;"We praise Thee, O God, 
For the Son of Thy love, 
For Jesus who died
And is now gone above.

Chorus
Hallelujah! 
Thine the glory,
Hallelujah! amen; 
Hallelujah!
Thine the glory, 
Revive us again.

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior,
And scattered our night.

All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins
And has cleansed ev'ry stain.

Revive us again;
Fill each heart with Thy love,
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above."
472;Take The Name Of Jesus With You;F;"Take the name of Jesus 
   with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it, then, where'er you go.

CHORUS
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

Take the name of Jesus with you,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

Oh the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our 
   tongues employ.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven 
   we'll crown Him
When our journey is complete."
473;Jesus Loves Me;C;"Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak but He is strong.

CHORUS
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin.
Let His little child come in.

Jesus loves me! loves me still,
Though I'm very weak and ill;
From His shining throne on high,
Comes to watch me where I lie.

Jesus loves me; He will stay
Close beside me all the way;
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high."
474;Look To The Lamb Of God;F;"If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God;
He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.

CHORUS
Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,
For He alone is able to save you;
Look to the Lamb of God.

When Satan tempts, 
and doubts and fears assail,
Look to the Lamb of God;
You in His strength 
Shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you aweary, 
Does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer 
And fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows 
On your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow 
Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God."
475;Blest Be The Tie That Binds;F;"Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, 
    our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again."
476;Sweet Hour Of Prayer;C;"Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
The joy I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return!
With such I hasten to the place
Where God, my Saviour, shows His face,
And gladly take my station there,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear,
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer."
477;When They Ring The Golden Bells;Eb;"There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore 
By faith's decree;
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

CHORUS
Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee.
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

We shall know no sin nor sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond
    the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
When in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands 
   the spirit to be free
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Aiden,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me."
478;Jesus, Lover Of My Soul;F;"Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high!
Hide me, oh my Savior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:
Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me!
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, oh Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
False and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace."
479;Joy To The World!;C;"Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.

Joy to the world! the Savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills
    and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, and wonders of His love."

Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.

Come, Desire of nations, come!
Fix in us Thy humble home:
Rise, the woman's conqu'ring seed,
Bruise in us the serpent's head;

Stamp Thine image in its place:
Second Adam from above,
Reinstate us in Thy love."

Radiant beams from Thy holy face,

483;Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem;Eb;"Oh little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by:
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary;
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Oh holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend on us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today.
We hear the holy angels
The great glad tidings tell;
Oh come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel."
484;It Came Upon The Midnight Clear;Bb;"It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
From heaven's all-gracious King:""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still thro' the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
Oh rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing.

For lo, the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the evercircling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing."
485;Away In A Manger;F;"Away in a manger,
No crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head;

Looked down where He lay,

Asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing,
The Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
No crying He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle,
Till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever,
And love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And take us to heaven,
To live with Thee there."

There's no other way but His way;

Do you not feel, dear brother,
His Spirit now striving within?
Oh, why not accept His salvation,
And throw off your burden of sin?

Why do you wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Savior is longing to bless you;
There's danger and death in delay."

For He's done so very 
   much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins,

Oh, I love, I love that

He cried, ""O Lord, 
   be merciful to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin, 
and a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this 
Man from Galilee.""

the dump was made to talk, 
That power was spoken with 
   love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that 
   Man from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
to know the way of right,
He asked the Son of man 
   what must he do.
These words He said to him, 
""Ye must be born again,""
By the Spirit of that

To the mountains, the lakes or the sea;
Where they rest from the cares and their worries,
What a wonderful time that must be!
But it seems not my lot to be like them,
I must toil thru the heat and the cold,
Seeking out the lost sheep on the mountains,
Bringing wanderers back to the fold.

CHORUS
When I take my vacation in heaven,
What a wonderful time that will be;
Hearing concerts by the heavenly Chorus'
And the face of my Saviour I'll see;
Sitting down by the banks of the river;
'Neath the shade of the ever green tree,
I shall rest from my burdens forever,
Won't you spend your vacation with me.

Now some day I shall take my vacation
To the city John tells us about;
With its foundation walls all so precious,
Where from gladness of heart I shall shout!
O no sights ever witnessed by mortals,
Can compare with the glories up there
I shall spend my vacation with Jesus,
In the place He went on to prepare.

There the weather will always be perfect,
Not a cloud shall sweep over the sky;
And no earthquakes or cyclones shall threaten,
In the land of the ""Sweet by and by"";
soon there's going to be an excursion,
I am booked for a ride in the air,
You're invited to share my vacation,
And the feast with our Bridegroom to share.

Here on earth when we take our vacation,
We return to our homes by and by;
When I take my vacation in heaven,
In those mansions of gold in the sky,
I shall dwell with my Savour forever,
With Him sit on His Heavenly Throne;
All the days will be one, long vacation,
When my Saviour takes me to His home."
633;What Then?;Ab;"When the great plants of our cities 
have turned out their last finished work,
When our merchants have 
sold their last yard of goods and 
dismissed the last tired clerk,
When our banks have raked 
in their last dollar and paid the last dividends,
When the Judge of the 
earth says, ""closed for the night,"" 
and asks for a balance What Then?

Chorus
What then? What then?
When the Great Book is opened, what then?
When the ones that's rejecting 
this Message tonight,
Will be asked to give a reason What Then?

When the choir has sung its last 
song and the preacher has said his last prayer,
When the people have heard their l
ast sermon and the sound has died out in the air,
When the Bible lies close on the altar 
and the pews are all epty of folks,
And each one stands facing his record 
and the Great Book is opened What Then?

When the actors have played drama 
and their last drama and the mimic 
has made his last fun,
When the film has flashed its last film 
and the billboard displayed its last run,
When the crowds seeking pleasure 
have vanished and all the liquor stores 
and beer joints have been closed,
And the salesman sold his last drink 
and gone out in the darkness,
When the trumpet of ages is sounded 
and we stand before Him, What Then?

When the bugle call sinks into silence 
and the long marching columns stand still,
And the captain repeats his last orders,
And the flag has been hauled from the mast,
And the wounded afield checked 
in and a world that rejects its 
Saviour is asked for a reason, What Then?"
634;It shall flow like a river;Ab;"It shall flow like a river, 
It shall fall like the rain,
It shall rise as a dew in 
morning o'er the plain;
For the knowledge of the 
Lord shall fill all the earth
When the Spirit of the 
Lord shall fall.

Flow, river, flow; flow, 
river, flow;
Flow out through the nations 
wherever man may go;
Cause life to spring forth, 
that all men may know
That You're the river of the Spirit;
Oh, flow, river, flow."

638;Please Let Me Walk With You;;"I've been on the 
   mountains with Jesus
I've been to the 
   valleys so low
But there's never one 
   time that He failed me
So to Him with 
   my troubles I'll go

CHORUS
Oh, please let me 
   walk with you Jesus,
Don't ever leave me alone,
For without You 
   I can never,
I can never make 
   heaven my home.

He found me when 
   I was so lonely
He found me when 
   I was so low
He found me when no 
   one could help me
When no one knew just 
   where to go

If I had all the wealth 
   of this world
And all that money could buy
But I had not the love 
   of my Saviour
I'd rather be dead than alive"
641;The Great Judgement;;"I dreamed that the great judgement morning
Had dawned, and the trumpet had blown;
I dreamed that the nations had gathered
To judgement before the white throne;
From the throne came a bright shining angel,
And stood on the land and the sea,
And swore with his hand raised to heaven,
That time was no longer to be.

CHORUS
And O, what a weeping and wailing,
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
They prayed, but their prayers were too late.

The rich man was there, but his money 
Had melted and vanished away;
A pauper he stood in the judgement,
His debts were too heavy to pay;
The great man was there, but his greatness,
When death came, was left far behind.
The angel that opened the records,
Not a trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there with the orphans,
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven forever,
God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
The gambler was there and the drunkard,
And the man that had sold them drink,
With people who gave him the licence,
Together in hell they did sink.

The moral man came to the judgement,
But his self-righteous rags would not do;
The men who had crucified Jesus
Has passed off as moral men, too;
The soul that had put off salvation,
""Not tonight; I'll get saved by and by,
No time now to think of religion!""
At last they had found time to die."
645;Farther along;;"Tempted and tried we're 
   oft made to wonder,
Why it should be thus 
   all day long,
While there are others 
   living about us,
Never molested though 
   in the wrong.

CHORUS
Farther along 
   we'll know all about it,
Farther along 
   we'll understand why;
Cheer up, my brother, 
   live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it 
   all by and by

When death has come and 
   taken our loved ones,
It leaves our home so 
   lonely and drear,
Then do we wonder 
   why others prosper,
Living so wicked 
   year after year.

Faithful till death said our 
   loving Master,
A few more days 
   to labor and wait;
Toils of the road will 
   then seem as nothing,
As we sweep through 
   the beautiful gate.

When we see Jesus 
   coming in glory,
When He comes from His 
   home in the sky;
Then we shall meet Him 
   in that bright mansion,
We'll understand it 
   all by and by."
646;Lead Me Higher;;"Jesus, lead me up the mountain,
Where the whitest robes are seen,
Where the saints can see the fountain,
Where the pure are keeping clean.

CHORUS
Lead me higher up the mountain,
Give me fellowship with Thee;
In Thy light I see the fountain,
And the blood is cleansing me.

Higher up, where light increases,
Rich above all earthly good,
Where the life of sinning ceases,
Where the Spirit comes in flood.

Lead me higher, nothing dreading,
Never in the race to stop,
In Thy footsteps keep me treading,
Give me grace to reach the top.

Save me better, make me surer,
Put me where the fire refines,
Where the breath of hope is purer,
Where the brightest glory shines."
647;My Sins Were Higher Than The Mountain;;"My sins were higher than

649;Wear a Crown;;"Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,

Yes, we shall wear a crown! Yes, 
   we shall wear a crown!
And when the battle's over, we 
   shall wear a crown!
In the new Jerusalem.

Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown.
And when the battle's over, we 
   shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Must I be carried to the skies
On flow'ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

And when the battle's over, we
   shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown! Yes, 
   we shall wear a crown!
And when the battle's over, we 
   shall wear a crown!
In the new Jerusalem.

Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown.
And when the battle's over, we 
   shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God?

And when the battle's over, we
   shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown! Yes, 
   we shall wear a crown!
And when the battle's over, we

Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown.
And when the battle's over, we

Increase my courage, Lord;
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word.

650;Just A Closer Walk;;"I am weak but Thou art strong,
Jesus keep me from all wrong;

As I walk, let me walk 
   close to Thee.

CHORUS
Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus is my plea;
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be dear Lord, let it be.

Thru this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, 
   none but Thee.

When my feeble life is o'er,
Time for me shall be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o'er,
To Thy kingdom shore, 
   to Thy shore."
651;Baptized into the Body;;"Have been baptized into 
the Body?
Baptized with the Holy Ghost;
There is but one way to 
enter in it,
Just as they did on Pentecost.

CHORUS
Are in the Church triumphant?
Are you in the Saviour's Bride?
Come and be baptized into 
the Body,
And forevermore abide.

There is but one Church, Bride 
or Body,
And into it we're all baptized;
By the one, true, promised 
Holy Spirit;
Though by ther world we're all 
despised.

Every creed has claimed to 
be the Body,
But the ""plumb line"" proved 
untrue,
All their dreams, for God 
has so determined,
To bring His Son's true Bride 
to view.

Many thought that they were in 
the Body.
'Til the Holy Ghost had come;
When the Word of God was 
opened to them,
They entered in, and yet 
there's room.

Those who died before the 
Holy Spirit
Came upon us from on high,
May, by faith with Saints of 
old departed,
Arise to meet Him in the sky.

When the Bridegroom comes, 
will you be ready;
And your vessel all filled 
and bright?
You will be among the foolish 
virgins
If you do not walk in the light."
652;What Would You Exchange;;"Brother a-far from the Saviour today,
Risking your soul on the things

Oh, if today God should call it away,
What would you give in exchange 
for your soul?

CHORUS
What would you give? What would
you give?
What would you give in exchange 
for your soul?
Oh, if today God should call it away,
What would you give in exchange 
for your soul?

Mercy is calling you, won't you
give heed?
Must the dear Saviour still
tenderly plead?
Risk not your soul, it is precious
indeed;
What would you give in exchange 
for your soul?

More than the silver and gold of
the earth,
More than all jewels thy spirit is
worth!
God, the Creator, has given it birth!
What would you give in exchange 
for your soul?

If, when you stand at the bar by
and by,
When you are weighed in the
balance on high,
You should be sentenced forever
to die,
What would you give in exchange 
for your soul?"
653;When He Reached Down;;"Once my soul was astray 
   from the heavenly way,
And was wretched and 
   vile as could be;
But my Saviour above, gave me
   peace, joy and love,
When He reached down 
   His hand for me.

CHORUS
When He reached down 
   His hand for me,
When He reached down 
   His hand for me;
I was lost and undone, 
   without God or His Son,
When He reached down 
   His hand for me.

I was nearing despair, 
   when He came to me there,
And He showed me that I 
   could be free;
Then He lifted my feet, 
   gave me glory complete,
When He reached down 
   His hand for me.

How my heart doth rejoice since 
   I made Him my choice,
From the tempest to 
   Him now I flee;
Now I lean on His arm, 
I'm secure from all harm,
Since He reached down 
   His hand for me.

Since the Lord gave me peace,
   heavenly joys never cease;
Lord, I give all my 
   life unto Thee;
Guide my feet, hold my hand, 
   grant with Thee I may stand,
For You reached down 
   Your hand for me."

will answer,
When He calls for me I will hear;

I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
for my name;
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
for my name.

If my heart is right when He 
calls me,
If my heart is right I will hear;
If my heart is right when He 
calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
for my name.

If my robe is white when He 
calls me,
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white when He 
calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
for my name."
656;The Old Rugged Cross;;"On a hill far away stood an 
   old rugged cross,
The emblem of suff'ring 
   and shame,
And I love that old cross where 
   the Dearest and best,
For a world of lost sinners 
   was slain.

CHORUS
So I'll cherish the 
   old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last 
   I lay down;
I will cling to the 
   old rugged cross,
And exchange it some 
   day for a crown.

Oh, that old rugged cross, so
   despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me
For the dear Lamb of God left
His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary

In the old rugged cross stained 
   with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see.
For 'twas on that old cross 
   Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

To the old rugged cross 
   I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day 
   to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share."
657;The More I Surrender;;"The more that I surrender,

I love you more."

CHORUS
What are you going to present to the Lord
At the end of your journey?
He's not going to be touched by anything
Save His testimony
What are you going to present to the Lord
I hope it makes you sigh and cry
Oh don't be found in that position
Where you would be wondering why

Though the world may offer its 
   pleasure and peace
And the luxurious life of ease
But we simply cannot continue on
For man's just like a breeze
A moment here and moment gone
Like a flower he fades away 
But I just want to stay
Right on to that perfect day.

Lord take thy Word, Thy Precious Word
And anoint It to my soul
Perfect what is lacking in my faith
And make thy servant whole
Drive my fears and my doubts away
For I just want to hear You say
Recieve thy crown, my beloved son
You have overcome .......well done

Take rest my soul in no other arms
Save Jesus own today
For He has opened my eyes to see
That judgement is on its way
But tho' ten thousand fell at my side
I will never be tossed aside
For in the shadow of the mighty Rock
Is where I'll abide."
803;Greater Is He That Is In Me;F;"On the day of Pentecost,
A mighty rushing wind
Flew into the upper room
And baptized all within.

CHORUS
Greater is He that is in me
Greater is He that is in me
Greater is He that is in me
Than he that is in the world

Satan, like a roaring lion,
Roaming to and fro,
Seeking whom he may devour,
The Bible tells me so.

Many souls have been his prey,
To fall in some weak hour,
But God has promised us today,
Overcoming power.

With a power greater than
Any earthly foe,
And I�m so glad I�ve got it too,
I�m gonna let the whole world know."
804;His Eye Is On The Sparrow;;"Why should I feel discouraged
Why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for Heav'n and home,
When Jesus is my portion?
My constant friend is He;
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

CHORUS
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me.

Let not your heart be troubled
His tender Word I hear
And resting on His goodness
I lose my doubts and fears;
Tho' by the path He leadeth
But one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me.
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me.

Whenever I am  tempted,
Whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place so sighing,
When hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him
From care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me.
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me."
805;God Is My Refuge;;"God is my refuge

806;He' Coming Soon;;"In these, the closing 
   days of time,
What joy the glorious 
   hope affords,
That soon oh, 
   wondrous truth sublime!
He shall reign, King of kings 
   and Lord of lords.

CHORUS
He's coming soon, 
   He's coming soon;
With joy we welcome 
   His returning;
It may be morn, 
   it may be night or noon,
We know He's 
   coming soon.

The signs around, 
   in earth and air,
Or painted on the starlit sky,
God's faithful 
   witnesses declare
That coming of the 
   Saviour draweth nigh.

The dead in Christ 
   who 'neath us lie,
In countless numbers, 
   all shall rise
When through the 
   portals of the sky
He shall come to 
   prepare our Paradise.

And we who, living, 
   yet remain,
Caught up, shall meet 
   our faith Lord;
This hope we cherish 
   not vain,
But we comfort one 
   another by this word."
808;Dying To Be Reunited;D;"Always inside of me there was a
   deep that was calling
But there never was a 
   deep to respond
My heart began searching
I didn�t know what for 
   until the day He came
Until He called my name
I can never, ever be the same

CHORUS
I'm dying to be reunited
And in my soul I'm excited
I'm dying to be reunited
With the One
Who always known me

Indeed He came to me
But that wasn�t all
The words He spoke to me 
   controlled my heart
Daily I die a death unseen 
   to human eyes
Until they see in me God 
   manifest in flesh
I can never, never be the same

[I�m looking for a change 
   in the inside
That will manifest on the outside] 2x
A body change in the 
   twinkle of an eye

811;He Looked Beyond My Fault;C;"Amazing grace shall always be 
My song of praise, 
For it was grace that bought my liberty.
I know just now why He came 
To love me so. 
He looked beyond my fault 
And saw my need.

I shall forever
Lift mine eyes to Calvary,
To view the cross
Where Jesus died for me. 
How marvellous, the grace
That caught my falling soul.
He looked beyond my fault
And saw my need."
812;In The Garden;Ab;"I come to the garden alone,
While the dew is still 
On the roses,
And the voice I hear,
Falling on my ear,
The Son of God discloses.

CHORUS
And He walks with me, 
And He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share, 
As we tarry there,
None other has ever known.

He speaks, 
And the sound of His voice
Is so sweet 
The birds hush their singing,
And the melody
That He gave to me,
Within my heart is ringing.

I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night 
Around me be falling,
But He bids me go;
Through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling."
813;Oh I Want To See Him;G;"As I journey through the land 
Singing as I go,
Pointing souls to Calvary, 
To the crimson flow,
Many arrows pierce my soul 
From without, within;
But my Lord leads me on, 
Through Him I must win.

CHORUS
Oh I want to see Him, 
Look upon His face,
There to sing forever 
Of His saving grace;
On the streets of Glory 
Let me lift my voice;
Cares all past, home at last, 
Ever to rejoice.

When in service for my Lord 
Dark may be the night,
But I'll cling more close to Him, 
He will give me light;
Satan's snares may vex my soul, 
Turn my thoughts aside;
But my Lord goes ahead, 
Leads whate'er betide.

When in valleys low I look 
Tow'rd the mountain height,
And behold my Savior there, 
Leading in the fight,
With a tender hand outstretched 
Tow'rd the valley low,
Guiding me, I can see, 
As I onward go.

When before me billows rise 
From the mighty deep,
Then the Lord directs my bark; 
He doth safely keep,
And He leads me gently on 
Through this world below;
He's a real friend to me, 
Oh I love Him so."
814;Spread Your Wings;;"So spread your wings 
Little Eagle and fly,
You weren't born for the valley
You were born for the sky

815;Power of Your Love;;"Lord, I come to You, let my 
   heart be changed, renewed,
Flowing from the grace, 
   That I found in You.
Lord, I've come to know, 
   The weaknesses I see in me,
Will be stripped away, 
   By the power of Your love.

CHORUS
Hold me close, 
Let Your love surround me.
Bring me near,
   draw me to Your side,
And as I wait, I'll rise up,
   like the eagle.
And I will soar with You, 
   Your Spirit leads me on,
By the power of Your Love.

Lord unveil my eyes, Let me,
   see You face to face.
The knowledge of Your love,

   will unfolds in my life.
Renew it everyday,

816;Eternal Rest;C;"Time's clock is striking the hour,
Jesus will soon descend,
Clothed in the garments of power,
The reign of sin to end.
Then will this anthem be ringing
Like to a mighty flood,
Then 'round the throne we'll be singing
Glory and praise to God.

CHORUS
Glory, glory to God!
Thus will the ransomed sing;
Glory, glory to God,
The everlasting King!
Praise Him, alleluia!
To that eternal sphere
We are waiting 
For our translating;
The time is near.

In those bright mansions supernal,
Death cannot enter there;
Ages on ages eternal
His likeness we shall bear.
There will the once broken-hearted
Rest in the spirit know;
Sorrow forever departed,
Gladness shall overflow.

Sighing forever is ended,
Foes shall oppress no more;
Voices in worship are blended
To Him whom all adore.
Bathed in the light soft and tender,
Sealed for eternity,
Praise to the Lamb we will render
Worthy of praise is He.

Beautiful, wonderful story! 
Jesus Himself the light;
There in the kingdom of glory
Never shall fall the night.
Now I am singing of heaven
While here I wage the strife;
Then will the victors be given
Crowns of eternal life."
817;Highway to Heaven;;"It is a Highway to Heaven
None can walk up there
But the pure in heart

If you are not walking
Start while I'm talking
Walking on the King's Highway

It will be a blessing
You will be confessing
Walking on the King's Highway

It is a Highway to Heaven
None can walk up there
But the pure in heart
It is a Highway to Heaven
Walking on the King's Highway"
818;My Tribute;G;"How can I say thanks 
For the things You have done for me,
Things so undeserved,
Yet You give 
To prove Your love for me;
The voices of a million angels
Could not express my gratitude;
All that I am and ever hope to be
I owe it all to Thee.

CHORUS
To God be the glory, 
To God be the glory,
To God be the glory,
For the things He has done;
With His blood He has saved me,
With His power He has raised me;

Let it be pleasing Lord, to Thee;
And should I gain any praise, 
Let it go to Calvary."

In my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart;
I have light in my soul 
For which long I had sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

CHORUS
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
Floods of joy o'er my soul
Like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I have ceased from my wandering
And going astray
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins which were many
Are all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I'm possessed of a hope
That is steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And no dark clouds of doubt 
Now my pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

There's a light in the valley 
Of death now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And the gates of the city 
Beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I shall go there to dwell
In that city I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I'm happy, so happy, 
As onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart."

Through it all, through it all,

And I've seen a lot of faces,
But there were times I felt so all alone;
But in my lonely hours,
Yes, those precious lonely hours,
Jesus let me know 
That I'm still one of His own.

So I thank God for the mountains,
And I thank Him for the valleys,
And I thank Him for the storms 
He brought me through;
For if I'd never had a problem,
I wouldn't know 
That He could solve them;
I wouldn't know 
What faith in God could do."

Raised up by God and given power

But gave away all of his secrets
Was now bound and in captivity.

In the book of his remembrance
Were all the great victories
   he had won
Realizing his present condition
From deep down inside this cry
began

CHORUS
Just once more Lord,
Just once more Lord.
So we can feel Your Spirit
Moving once again
Just once more Lord

Repenting of all
   mistakes and failures
Praying in his heart Lord let me die
Not considering
   what it would cost him
Should God hear and would
   answer his sincere cry

For he could feel his locks
   had grown out
Thinking is there a possibility
   of the power of God coming back
Began to cry more earnestly

With a promise of retoration
We have seen God�s church rise in
   power through each stage
Until God sent to us a prophet
And we have seen the fullness of
God�s life on display

Inaugurated at Pentecost
Signs and wonders,
   manifestation of His name
But there at the council of Nicea
The early church
   had its locks shaved

But it's been so long
   since the eyes have gone out
And there is a new crop
   that is coming forth
For greater works and dynamic

The darkness deepens; 
   Lord with me abide. 
When other helpers fail 
   and comforts flee, 
Help of the helpless, 
   O abide with me. 

Swift to its close ebbs 
   out life�s little day; 
Earth�s joys grow dim; 
   its glories pass away; 
Change and decay in all 
   around I see; 
O Thou who changest not, 
   abide with me. 

Not a brief glance I beg, 
   a passing word; 
But as Thou dwell�st with 
   Thy disciples, Lord, 
Familiar, condescending,
   patient, free. 
Come not to sojourn, 
   but abide with me. 

Come not in terrors, 
   as the King of kings, 
But kind and good, 
   with healing in Thy wings, 
Tears for all woes, 
   a heart for every plea
Come, Friend of sinners, 
   and thus bide with me. 

Thou on my head in early 
   youth didst smile; 
And, though rebellious and 
   perverse meanwhile, 
Thou hast not left me, 
   oft as I left Thee, 
On to the close, O Lord, 
   abide with me. 

I need Thy presence 
   every passing hour. 
What but Thy grace can foil 
   the tempter�s power? 
Who, like Thyself, my guide 
   and stay can be? 
Through cloud and sunshine, 
   Lord, abide with me. 

I fear no foe, with Thee 
   at hand to bless; 
Ills have no weight, 
   and tears no bitterness. 
Where is death�s sting? Where, 
   grave, thy victory? 
I triumph still, if Thou 
   abide with me. 

Hold Thou Thy cross before 
   my closing eyes; 
Shine through the gloom and 
   point me to the skies. 
Heaven�s morning breaks, 
   and earth�s vain shadows flee; 
In life, in death, O Lord, 
   abide with me."

Speak, my Lord,
Speak and I'll be quick 
To answer Thee;
Speak, my Lord, 
Speak, my Lord
Speak, and I will answer, 
""Lord send me.""

When the coal of fire 
Touched the prophet,
Making him as pure, 
As pure can be;
When the voice of God said, 
""Who'll go for us?'
Then he answered, 
""Here I am, send me.""

Millions now in sin 
And shame are dying;
Listen to their sad 
And bitter cry;
Hasten, brother, 
Hasten to the rescue;
Quickly answer,

Soon the time for reaping 
Will be over;
Soon we'll gather for 
The harvest home;
May the Lord of harvest 
Smile upon us,
May we hear His blessed,

841;I Pledge Allegiance;G;"I have heard how Christians long ago
Were brought before a tyrant's throne
They were told that he would spare their lives
If they would renounce the name of Christ
But one by one, they chose to die,
The Son of God they would not deny.
Like a great angelic choir sings, 
I can almost hear their voices ring

CHORUS
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honour His command
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb.

Now the years have come
   and the years have gone.
But the cause of Jesus still goes on
Now our time has come to count the cost
To reject this world, to embrace the cross
So, one by one, let us live our lives

Not a shadow can 
My blissful soul affright;
For I know 
That up in heaven there is room,
In that city 
Where the Lamb is the light."

We're feeding on the Living Bread,
We're drinking at the Fountain-head;
And who-so drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

And who-so drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

There everlasting spring abides,
And never-with'ring flowers:
Death, like a narrow sea, divides
This heavenly land, from ours.

O could we make our doubts remove,
Those gloomy thoughts that rise,
And view the Canaan that we love
With un-beclouded eyes.

Could we but climb where Moses stood?
And view the landscape o'er,
Not Jordan's stream , nor death's cold flood,
Should fright us from the shore.

We're marching through Immanuel's, ground,
And soon shall hear the trumpet sound.
And then we shall with Jesus reign,
And never, never part again.

No, never part again!]       X2

And never, never part again."

Looking to the unseen,
   We see a brighter and better world,
So on the promises of God,
   Is what we'd anchor our souls. 

Born to overcome this wicked world

The promises of God
