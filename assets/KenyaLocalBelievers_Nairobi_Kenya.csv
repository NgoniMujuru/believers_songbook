1;ONLY BELIEVE;;"Fear not, little flock, 
from the cross to the throne,
From death into life 
He went for His own;
All power in earth, 
all power above,
Is given to Him 
for the flock of His love.

CHORUS
Only believe, only believe,
All things are possible, 
Only believe, Only believe, 
only believe,
All things are possible, 
only believe. 
(Lord, I believe...) 
(Lord, I receive. .
(Jesus Is here...)

Fear not, little flock,
He goeth ahead,
Your Shepherd selecteth 
the path you must tread; 
The waters of Marah 
He’ll sweeten for thee, 
He drank all the bitter 
in Gethsemane.

Fear not, little flock, 
whatever your lot,
He enters all rooms, 
the doors being shut;
He never forsakes, 
He never is gone, 
So count on His presence 
in darkness and dawn."
2;AMAZING GRACE;;"Amazing grace! 
How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, 
but now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.


Twas grace that taught 
my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did 
that grace appear
The hour I first believed!


Through many dangers, 
toils and snares,
I have already come; 
Tis grace that brought 
me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.


When we’ve been there 
ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun;
We’ve no less days 
to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun."
3;THEY COME;;"They come from the East and West,
They come from the lands afar,
To feast with the King, to dine as
His guest
How Blessed these pilgrims are
Beholding His hallowed face
Aglow with light divine;
Blest partakers of His grace,
As gems in His crown to shine.


CHORUS
Since Jesus has set me free,
I’m happy as heart can be;
No longer I bear the burden of care,
His yoke Is so sweet to me,
My soul was as black as night,
But darkness has taken flight;
Now I shout the victory,
For Jesus has set me free.


I look on the great white throne,
Before it the ransom’d stand;
No longer are tears, no sorrow is known
Nor death in that goodly land.
My Saviour has gone before,
Preparing the way for me;
Soon we’ll meet to part to more
Thru’ time or eternity.


The gates of that holy place
Stand open by night and day;
Oh look to the Lord who giveth more grace,
Whose love has prepared the way.
A home in those mansions fair
His hand hath reserved for all.
For the wedding feast prepare,
Obeying the gracious call.


Oh Jesus is coming soon, 
Our trials will then be o’er
 What if our Lord this moment should come
For those who are free from sin?
Then would it bring you joy,
Or sorrow and deep despair?
When our Lord in glory comes,
We’ll meet Him up in the air."
4;I LOVE HIM;;"Gone from my heart the 
world and all its charms;
Now, through the blood,
I’m saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my 
heart is bending low, 
The precious blood of Jesus 
cleanses white as snow.

CHORUS
I love Him, I love Him
Because He first loved me 
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary’s tree.

Once I was lost, and 
way down deep in sin;
Once was a slave to 
passions fierce within;
Once was afraid to trust 
a loving God; 
But now I’m cleansed 
from every stain
Through Jesus’ blood.


Once I was bound, 
but now I am set free;
Once I was blind, 
but now the light I see;
Once I was dead, 
but now in Christ I live,
To tell the world around the 
peace that He doth give."
5;SWEET HOUR OF PRAYER;;"Sweet hour of prayer,
sweet hour of prayer, 
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me, at my Father’s throne,
Make all my wants and wishes known
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter’s snare, 
By Thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer,
sweet hour of prayer, 
The joy I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for Thy return! 
With such I hasten to the place
Where God, my Saviour,
shows His face,
And gladly take my station there, 
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.


Sweet hour of prayer,
sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear 
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His Word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer."
6;OH, HOW I LOVE JESUS;;"There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in mine ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

CHORUS
Oh, how I love Jesus,
Oh, how I love Jesus,
Oh, how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.

It tells me of a Savior’s love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood;
The sinner’s perfect plea.

It tells me what my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part,
That none can bear below."
7;WHEN THE REDEEMED GATHER;;"I am thinking of the rapture
In our blessed home on high,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
How we'll raise the heavenly anthem
In that city in the sky
When the redeemed are gathering in.

CHORUS
When the redeemed are gathering In
Washed like the snow, 
and free from all sin;
How we will shout, 
and how we will sing,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

There will be a great procession 
over on the streets of goId,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Oh what music, O what singing,
o’er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed are gathering in.


Saints will sing redemption’s story 
with their voices clear and strong
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Then the angels all will listen,
for they cannot join that song,
When the redeemed are gathering in.


Then the Saviour will give orders 
to prepare the banquet board,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
And we'll hear His invitation,
Come, ye blessed of the Lord,
When the redeemed are gathering in."
8;OH, I WANT TO SEE HIM;;"As I journey through the land,
singing as I go, 
Pointing souls to Calvary, 
to the crimson flow,
Many arrows pierce my soul
from without, within;
But my Lord leads me on,
through Him I must win.

CHORUS
Oh, I want to see Him,
look upon His face,
There to sing forever of His 
saving grace;
On the streets of Glory let me 
lift my voice;
Cares all past, home at last, 
ever to rejoice.


When in service for my Lord, 
dark may be the night,
But I’ll cling more close to Him,
He will give me light; 
Satan’s snares may vex my soul,
turn my thoughts aside;
But my Lord goes ahead,
leads whate’er betide.


When in valleys low 
I look toward the mountain height,
And behold my Saviour there,
leading in the fight, 
With a tender hand outstretched
toward the valley low;
Guiding me, I can see, as I onward go.


When before me billows rise
from the mighty deep, 
Then my Lord directs my back,
He doth safely keep,
And He leads me gently on
through this world below;
He’s a real Friend to me,
Oh I love Him so"

They that wait upon the Lord,
shall renew their strength 
They shall mount up with wings 
as an eagle,
They shall run and not be weary, 
they shall walk and not faint;
Teach me Lord, teach me Lord, 
to wait.


Teach me Lord, to wait 
while hearts are aflame,
Help me humble my pride

Help me be on this earth 
what You want me to be."

we shall wear a crown! 
Yes, we shall wear a crown!

And when the battle’s over, 
we shall wear a crown 
In the new Jerusalem.
Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown,
And when the battle’s over
we shall wear a crown 
In the new Jerusalem.

Must I be carried to the skies
On flow’ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God?

Sure I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord; 
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
Supported by Thy word."

And cleanse within;

Threaten the soul 
With infinite loss;

Points to the refuge,

That we cannot hide,
What can avail 
To wash it away?

A crimson tide;
Whiter than snow

mortal ken,
Some day, God only knows just where 
and when,
The wheels of mortal life shall 
all stand still, 
And I shall go to dwell on Zion’s hill.


Some day I'll hear the angels 
singing, 
Beyond the shadows of the tomb; 
And all the bells of heaven 
ringing, 
While saints are singing, 
sweet Home, sweet Home


Some day my labors will be 
ended,
And all my wand’rings will be o’er,
And all earth’s broken ties be 
mended,
And I shall sigh and weep 
no more.

be lifted,
And all the night of gloom be past;
And all life’s burdens will be lifted,
The day of rest shall dawn at last."

May speak their joys abroad,

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the 
heavenly fields,
Before we reach the

They abide in the fold,
And go not astray,

I have made them My choice,
And they follow My call,
For My sheep know My voice.

My sheep know My voice, 
And the pastures of green, 
Where I lead them so 
often to feed;
My sheep know My voice, 
And the cool sparkling stream, 
Where beside its still 
waters I lead.

We are not divided,
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.

Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
‘Gainst the Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise,
Which can never fail.

At the sign of triumph,
Satan’s host doth flee;
Oh, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!

At the shout of praise;

How a Saviour came from glory,

Of His precious blood’s atoning,
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory.

CHORUS
Oh victory in Jesus
My Saviour, forever,
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing blood

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing pow’r revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit,
And somehow Jesus came and brought,
To me the victory.

I heard about a mansion,
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
The song of victory."

Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou has died for me,
Oh may my love to Thee,
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life’s dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow’s tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside."

Trusting, confiding In His great love;
From all harm safe In His sheltering arm, 
I’m living by faith and feel no alarm.

Though tempest may blow and the 
storm clouds arise, 
Obscuring the brightness of life, 
I’m never alarmed at the overcast skies, 
The Master looks on at the strife.

I know that He safely will carry 
me through, 
No matter what evils betide? 
Why should I then care, though the 
tempest may blow, 
If Jesus walks close to my side.

Our Lord will return to this earth 
some sweet day,
Our troubles will then all be o’er! 
The Master so gently will lead us away, 
Beyond that blest heavenly shore."

When I reach that city on the hill.

I’m invited to come home to that city,
For the Word says, whosoever will,

When I reach that city on the hill.

Death will never molest me in that city,
Never leave me lying cold and chill;
And I’ll enter to live up there forever
When I reach that city on the hill.

Farther along we’ll know 
all about it, 
Farther along we’ll 
understand why;
Cheer up, my brother, 
live in the sunshine, 
We’ll understand it all 
by and by

When death has come and 
taken our loved ones, 
It leaves our home 
so lonely and drear;
Then do we wonder 
why others prosper
Living so wicked year 
after year.

Faithful till death said our 
loving Master, 
A few more days to labor and wait; 
Toils of the road will then 
seem as nothing, 
As we sweep through the 
beautiful gate.

When we see Jesus coming 
in glory,
When He comes from His 
Home in the sky;
Then we shall meet Him in that 
bright mansion, 
We’ll understand it all 
by and by."

As I walk with the heavenly Dove;
Let me go all the while, 
with a song and a smile, 
Fill my way every day with love.

Keep me close to the side 
of My Saviour and Guide,
Let me never in darkness rove;
Keep my path free from wrath, 
and my soul satisfied,
Fill my way every day with love.

Let me sing, blessed King, 
all the way to the shore, 
Fill my way every day with love."

of God my Saviour 
Standing, standing, 
I’m standing on the promises 
of God.


Standing on the promises that 
cannot fail, 
When the howling storms of 
doubt and fear assail, 
By the living Word of God I shall 
prevail, 
Standing on the promises 
of God.


Standing on the promises I now 
can see
Perfect, present cleansing in the blood 
for me; 
Standing In the liberty where Christ 
makes free, 
Standing on the promises 
of God.


Standing in the liberty where 
Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally by love’s 
strong cord, 
Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s 
sword, 
Standing on the promises 
of God.


Standing on the promises I 
cannot fall, 
List’ning every moment to the Spirit’s 
call, 
Resting In my Saviour, as my all 
in all, 
Standing on the promises 
of God."
32;BY AND BY, WHEN THE MORNING COMES;;"We are often tossed and driven 
on the restless sea of time, 
Sombre skies and howling tempests
oft succeed a bright sunshine; 
In that land of perfect day, 
when the mists have rolled away, 
We will understand it better by and by.

CHORUS
By and by when that 
morning comes, 
When all the saints of God are 
gathered home, 
We will tell the story of how 
we overcome, 
For we’ll understand It better by and by.

We are often destitute of the things
that life demands, 
Want of food and want of shelter, 
thirsty hills and barren lands, 
But we’re trusting in the Lord, 
and according to His Word, 
We will understand it better by and by.

Trials dark on every hand, 
and we cannot understand, 
All the ways that God would lead us
to that blessed Promised Land; 
But He guides us with His eye 
and we’ll follow till we die, 
For we’ll understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares 
often take us unawares, 
And our hearts are made to bleed 
for many a thoughtless word or deed, 
And we wonder why the test 
when we try to do our best, 
But we'll understand it better by and by."
33;ROCK OF AGES;;"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure, 
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee."
34;WHEN I SEE THE BLOOD;;"Christ our Redeemer died 
on the cross, 
Died for the sinner, paid all His due;
Sprinkle your soul with the 
blood of the Lamb, 
And I will pass, will pass over you.

CHORUS
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
I will pass, I will pass over you.

Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save;
All He has promised, 
that will He do;
Wash in the fountain 
opened for sin, 
And I will pass, will pass over you.

Judgement is coming, 
all will be there, 
Each one receiving justly his due; 
Hide in the saving
sin-cleansing blood, 
And I will pass, will pass over you.

Oh, great compassion! 
O boundless love!
Oh loving kindness, faithful and true!
Find peace and shelter 
under the blood, 
And I will pass, will pass over you."
35;LOVE LIFTED ME;;"I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more;
But the Master of the sea
Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
Now safe am I.

CHORUS
Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 
When nothing else could help, 
love lifted me. 
Love lifted me Love lifted me 
When nothing else could help, 
love lifted me.

All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I’ll cling,
In His blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing,
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul’s best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belongs.

Souls in danger, look above,
Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by His love
Out of the angry waves
He’s the Master of the sea,
Billows His will obey;
He your Saviour wants to be;
Be saved today."
36;SHOWERS OF BLESSINGS;;"There shall be showers of blessing,
This is the promise of love; 
There shall be seasons refreshing, 
Sent from the Saviour above,

CHORUS
Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercydrops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing,
Precious reviving again; 
Over the hills and the valleys, 
Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of blessing,
Send them upon us, O Lord; 
Grant to us now a refreshing, 
Come, and now honor Thy Word.

There shall be showers of blessing,
Oh, that today they might fall, 
Now as to God we’re confessing, 
Now as on Jesus we call!"
37;HAVE THINE OWN WAY,;;"Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Thou art the Potter;
I am the clay.
Mould me and make me
After Thy will,
While I am waiting,
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way
Search me and try me,
Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in Thy presence,
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray!
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine!

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o’er my being
Absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me!"
38;DRAW ME NEARER;;"I am Thine O Lord, 
I have heard Thy voice,
And it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise 
In the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

CHORUS
Draw me nearer,
nearer, blessed lord, 
To the cross 
where Thou has died;
Draw me nearer, 
nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious bleeding side.

Consecrate me now 
To Thy service Lord,
By the pow’r of grace divine;
Let my soul lookup with a
steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight 
of a single hour
That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, 
and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend.

There are depths of love 
that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea, 
There are heights of joy 
that I may not reach, 
Till I rest in peace with Thee."
39;I AM MARKED;;"I have lost my reputation 
since I turned my back on sin, 
And a lot of friends went from me, 
since I let my Saviour in; 
Now they pass me by unknown, 
when they once passed with a smile;
Now they say I’m very foolish, 
and they say I’m out of style.

CHORUS
I am marked, marked, marked,
I am marked, now wherever I go;
I am marked, marked, marked,
Just what I am every-one
seems to know.
I am sealed, sealed, sealed,
I am sealed by- His Spirit Divine;
Oh glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen!
I am His, and I know He is mine.

Well, they say my life is ruined, 
and my talent thrown away, 
And they cannot understand it, for
I had such plans one day; 
But I know what I surrendered 
when I promised I’d go through; 
And I gained far more glory 
since God made me over new."
40;WON'T IT BE WONDERFUL?;;"When with the Saviour 
we enter the gloryland, 
Won't it be wonderful there? 
Ended the troubles 
and cares of the storyland, 
Won't it be wonderful there?

CHORUS
Won't It be wonderful there,
Having no burdens to bear?
Joyously singing with heart-
bells all ringing,
Oh won't It be wonderful there?

Walking and talking with Christ, 
the supernal One, 
Won't it be wonderful there? 
Praising, adoring 
the matchless eternal One, 
Won't it be wonderful there?

There where the tempest 
will never be sweeping us, 
Won't it be wonderful there? 
Sure that forever 
the Lord will be keeping us, 
Won't it be wonderful there?"
41;WINGS OF A DOVE;;"Noah had drifted
On the floods many days,
He searched for land
In various ways;
Troubles he had some,
But not from above,
God gave him His sign
On the wings of a dove.

CHORUS
On the wings of a 
snow-white dove, 
God sends down 
His pure, sweet love, 
A sign from above, 
On the wings of a dove.

Jesus, our Saviour
Came to earth one day;
He was born in a stable,
In a manger of hay;
Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign
On the wings of a dove.

Though I have suffered
In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;
Faith wasn’t forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign
On the wings of a dove."
42;I FEEL LIKE TRAVELLING ON;;"My heavenly home 
is bright and fair, 
I feel like travelling on, 
Nor pain, nor death 
can enter there, 
I feel like travelling on.

CHORUS
Yes, I feel like travelling on,
I feel like travelling on,
My heavenly home 
is bright and fair,
I feel like travelling on.

It's glittering towers the sun 
outshine, 
I feel like travelling on, 
That heavenly mansion 
shall be mine,
I feel like travelling on.

Let others seek a home below,
I feel like travelling on,
Which flames devour, 
or waves o’er flow,
I feel like travelling on.

The Lord has been so good to me,
I feel like travelling on,
Until that blessed home I see,
I feel like travelling on."
43;COME AND DINE;;"Jesus has a table spread 
where the saints of God are fed, 
He invites His chosen people 
‘Come and dine;
With His manna He doth feed 
And supplies our every need; 
Oh, ‘tis sweet to sup 
with Jesus all the time!

CHORUS
Come and dine, the Master calleth, 
Come and dine;
You may feast at Jesus’ 
table all the time; 
He who fed the multitude, 
turned the water into wine, 
To the hungry calleth now, 
Come and dine.

The disciples came to land, 
Thus obeying Christ’s command, 
For the Master called to them, 
Come and dine;
There they found their hearts’ 
desire, 
Bread and fish upon the fire; 
Thus He satisfies the hungry 
every time.

Soon the Lamb will take His bride 
To be ever at His side,
All the host of heaven 
will assembled be; 
Oh, ‘twill be a glorious sight, 
All the saints in spotless white,
And with Jesus they will feast
Eternally."
44;GOD LEADS US ALONG;;"In shady, green pastures, 
so rich and so sweet, 
God leads His dear children along; 
Where the water’s cool flow 
bathes the weary one’s feet, 
God leads His dear children along.

CHORUS
Some through the waters, 
Some through the flood, 
Some through the fire, 
but all through the Blood; 
Some through great sorrow, 
but God gives a song, 
In the night season and all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount 
where the sun shines so bright, 
God leads His dear children along; 
Sometimes in the valley 
in the darkest of night, 
God leads His dear children along.

Tho’ sorrows befall us, 
and Satan oppose, 
God leads His dear children along; 
Through grace we can conquer, 
defeat all our foes, 
God leads His dear children along.

Away from the mire, 
and away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity’s day,
God leads His dear children along."
45;LEANING ON THE EVERLASTING ARMS;;"What a fellowship, 
what a joy divine, 
Leaning on the everlasting arms; 
What a blessedness, 
what a peace is mine, 
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

CHORUS
Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Oh, how sweet to walk 
in this pilgrim way, 
Leaning on the everlasting arms; 
Oh, how bright the path 
grows from day to day, 
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

What have I to dread, 
what have I to fear, 
Leaning on the everlasting arms; 
I have blessed peace 
with my Lord so near, 
Leaning on the everlasting arms."
46;SUNLIGHT;;"I wandered in the shades of night,
Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee.

CHORUS
Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today, 
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way;
Since the Saviour found me, 
took away my sin, 
I have had the sunlight of His love within.

Though clouds may gather 
in the sky,
And billows ‘round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I’ve sunlight in my soul.

While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigour on,
And leave the world behind.

I cross the wide extended fields,
I journey o’er the plains,
And in the sunlight of His love
I reap the golden grain.

Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The light that came to me;
Behold the brightness of His face,
Throughout eternity."
47;I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED;;"I know not why God's 
wondrous grace
to me he hath made known,
nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His Own.

CHORUS
But I know whom I have Believed
And I'm persuaded that He Is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against the day,

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may
come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I’ll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air.’"
48;BRINGING IN THE SHEAVES;;"Sowing in the morning, 
sowing seeds of kindness, 
Sowing in the noontide 
and the dewy eve;
Waiting for the harvest 
and the time of reaping, 
We shall come rejoicing, 
bringing in the sheaves.

CHORUS
Bringing in the sheaves, 
bringing In the sheaves, 
We shall come rejoicing, 
bringing In the sheaves;
Bringing In the sheaves, 
bringing in the sheaves, 
We shall come rejoicing 
bringing In the sheaves.

Sowing in the sunshine, 
sowing in the shadows, 
Fearing neither clouds
nor winter’s chilling breeze; 
By and by the harvest 
and the labor ended, 
We shall come rejoicing, 
bringing in the sheaves.

Going forth with weeping, 
sowing for the Master, 
Though the loss sustained, 
our spirit often grieves; 
When our weeping’s over, 
He will bid us welcome, 
We shall come rejoicing, 
bringing in the sheaves."
49;SOME GOLDEN DAYBREAK;;"Some glorious morning 
sorrow will cease, 
Some glorious morning 
all will be peace; 
Heartaches all ended, 
schooldays all done, 
Heaven will open, 
Jesus will come.

CHORUS
Some golden daybreak, 
Jesus will come;
Some golden daybreak, 
battles all won, 
He’ll shout the victory, 
break through the blue, 
Some golden daybreak, 
for me, for you.

Sad hearts will gladden, 
all shall be bright, 
Good-bye forever to earth’s 
dark night;
Changed in a moment, 
like Him to be, 
Oh, glorious daybreak, 
Jesus I’ll see.

Oh, what a meeting, 
there in the skies,
No tears nor crying shall dim our
eyes;
Loved ones united eternally, 
Oh, what a daybreak
that morn will be."
50;SHALL WE GATHER  AT THE RIVER;;"Shall we gather at the river,
Where bright angels feet have trod,
With it's crystal tide forever,
Flowing by the throne of God?

CHORUS
Yes, we’ll gather at the river, 
The beautiful, the beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God.

On the bosom of the river, 
Where the Saviour-King we own 
We shall meet and sorrow never, 
‘Neath the glory of the throne.

On the margin of the river,
Washing up it's silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy, golden day.

Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver
And provide a robe and crown.

At the smiling of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour’s face,
Saints whom death will never
sever
Lift their songs of saving grace.

Soon we’ll reach the shining river
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace."
51;GLORY TO HIS NAME;;"Down at the cross 
where my Saviour died,
Down where for cleansing 
from sin I cried;
There to my heart 
was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

Glory to His name!
There to my heart was the
blood applied;
Glory to His name!

I am so wondrously 
saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly 
abides within,
There at the cross 
where He took me in;
Glory to His name!

Oh, precious fountain 
that saves from sin!
I am so glad I have entered in; 
There Jesus saves me 
and keeps me clean;
Glory to His name!

Come, to this fountain 
so rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul 
at the Saviour’s feet;
Plunge in today 
and be made complete;
Glory to His name!"
52;HE BROUGHT ME OUT;;"My heart was distressed 
‘neath Jehovah’s dread frown,
And low in the pit 
where my sins dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord 
from the deep miry clay, 
Who tenderly brought me 
out to golden day.

CHORUS
He brought me out 
of the miry clay, 
He set my feet on the Rock 
to stay; 
He puts a song in my 
soul today, 
A song of praise, hallelujah!

He placed me upon 
the strong Rock by His side, 
My steps were established 
and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling 
while here I remain, 
But stand by His grace 
until the crown I gain.

He gave me a song, 
‘twas a new song of praise, 
By day and by night 
its sweet notes I will raise; 
My heart’s overflowing, 
I’m happy and free, 
I'll praise my Redeemer, 
who has rescued me.

I’ll sing of His wonderful 
mercy to me, 
I’ll praise Him till all men 
His goodness shall see; 
I’ll sing of salvation
at home and abroad, 
Till many shall hear 
the truth and trust in God."
53;SWEET BY AND BY;;"There's a land that is 
fairer than day, 
And by faith we can 
see it afar; 
For the Father waits 
over the way, 
To prepare us a dwelling 
place there.

CHORUS
In the sweet by and by, 
We shall meet on that 
beautiful shore; 
In the sweet by and by, 
We shall meet on that 
beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that 
beautiful shore, 
The melodious songs of 
the blest,
 And our spirits shall 
sorrow no more, 
Not a sigh for the 
blessing of rest.

To our bountiful Father 
above,
We will offer our tribute 
of praise,
For the glorious gift of 
His love,
And the blessings that 
hallow our days."
54;THERE IS A FOUNTAIN;;"There is a fountain 
filled with blood, 
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins, 
And sinners plunge 
beneath that flood, 
Lose all their guilty stains. 

Lose all their guilty stains, 
Lose all their guilty stains; 
And sinners plunge beneath 
that flood, 
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious
 blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

Be saved , to sin no more,
Be saved , to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been 
 my theme,
And shall be till I die.

And shall be till I die,
And shall be till l die,
Redeeming Iove has been 
 my theme,
And shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy power to save, 
When this poor lisping, 
 stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave. 

Lies silent in the grave, 
Lies silent in the grave; 
When this poor lisping, 
 stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave.

I do Believe, I will believe
That Jesus died for me
That on the cross He shed
His Blood, From sin to set
 me Free !"

His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires 
of a hundred circling camps; 
They have builded Him an altar 
in the evening dews and damps; 
I can read His righteous sentence 
by the dim and flaring lamps; 
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet 
that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men 
before His judgment seat; 
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him! 
Be jubilant, my feet! 
Our God is marching on.

In the Beauty of the lilies 
Christ was born, across the sea, 
With a glory in His bosom 
that trans-figures you and me; 
As He died to make men holy, 
let us die to make men free; 
While God is marching on."

59;THE CIRCUIT RIDER;;"The circuit-rider preacher 
went riding through the land, 
With a rifle on his shoulder 
and a Bible in his hand;
He told the prairie people 
of a blessed promised Land, 
As he went riding, singing along.

Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arm;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning On the everlasting arm.

He preached the coming judgment 
of fire and brimstone; 
And a glorious endless Heaven 
of the justified alone.
As he rode across the mountain 
you could hear him sing this song, 
As he went riding on.

There is power, power, 
wonder working power, 
In the blood of the Lamb; 
There is power, power, 
wonder working power, 
In the precious blood of the Lamb.

His rifle’s old and rusty, 
and it’s hanging on the wall; 
His Bible’s worn and dusty, 
and it’s seldom touched at all; 
But his Message from this Bible 
will meet us at Judgment Day, 
For God’s Truth keeps marching on

Glory! glory, hallelujah!
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on."

One step at a time;
live for the moment,

Each step of the way.

The pathway is narrow,
But He leads me on;

My fears are all gone.
My spirit grows stronger,
Each moment, each day,
For Jesus is leading
Each step of the way."

Just like a tree that’s 
planted by the waters, 
I shall not be moved.

Though the tempest rages, 
I shall not be moved;
On the Rock of Ages, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that’s 
planted by the waters, 
I shall not be moved."
62;YESTERDAY, TODAY,FOREVER;;"Oh, how sweet the glorious
message,
Simple faith may claim;
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same..
Still He loves to save the sinful,
Heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the
tempest;
Glory to His name!

CHORUS
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same;
All may change, but Jesus
never!
Glory to His name.
Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
All may change but Jesus
never!
Glory to His name.

He who was the friend of sinners,
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at His footstool
Penitently bow.
He who said, I’ll not condemn
thee,
Go and sin no more;
Speaks to thee that word of
pardon,
As in days of yore.

Oft on earth He healed the suff’rer
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue,
To a woman’s touch;
To the faith that claims His
fullness,
Still will give as much.

He who pardoned erring Peter,
Never need’st thou fear;
He that came to faithless Thomas,
All thy doubt will clear.
He who let the loved disciple
On His bosom rest,
Bids thee still, with love as tender,
Lean upon His breast.

He who ‘mid the raging billows, 
Walked upon the sea;
 Still can hush our wildest tempest 
As on Galilee.
He who wept and prayed in anguish
In Gethsemane, 
Drinks with us each cup of trembling,
 in our agony.

As of old He walked to Emmaus
With them to abide;
So through all life’s way He
walketh,
Ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him,
Hasten, Lord, the day!
But ‘twill still be this same Jesus,
As He went away."
63;THE OLD TIME RELIGION;;"It’s the old-time Holy Spirit, 
And the devil won’t go near it

But it’s good enough for me.

CHORUS
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
It’s good enough for me.

It will make you stop your lying; 
It will save you when you’re dying;
It will start the devil flying;
And It’s good enough for me.

It’s so good I want no other,
For it makes me love my brother;
And it brings things from under cover,
And it’s good enough for me.

(It was good in the fiery furnace)
(It was good for Paul and Silas)
(It was good for our fathers)
And it’s good enough for me.

(It was good for Brother Branham)
(Makes me love everybody)
(It will take us all to heaven)
And it’s good enough for me.

communion,
Jesus is a friend of mine.

A friend when other friendships cease,
A friend when others fail,

A friend when sickness lays me low,
A friend when death draws near,
A friend as through the vale I go,
A friend to help and cheer.

A friend when life’s short race is o’er,
A friend when earth is past,
A friend to meet on heaven’s shore,
A friend when home at last."

Let Him have His way 
until the day is done;

Life is but an empty tomb,
Breathe a prayer to Jesus only,

Over on the other side."

All I need to cleanse and 
make me fully whole. 


In sorrow He’s my comfort, 
in trouble He’s my stay, 
He tells me every care on Him to roll,
Hallelujah!
He’s the Lily of the Valley, 
 the Bright and Morning Star, 
He’s the fairest of ten thousand 
to my soul.

He all my griefs has taken, 
and all my sorrows borne;
In temptation He’s my strong and 
mighty tow’r;
I have all for Him forsaken, 
and all my idols torn
From my heart, and now 
He keeps me by His power.


Though all the world forsake me, 
and Satan tempt me sore, 
Through Jesus I shall safely 
reach the goal.
Hallelujah!
He's the Lily of the Valley, 
the Bright and Morning Star, 
He’s the fairest of ten thousand 
to my soul.

He’ll never, never leave me, 
nor yet forsake me here, 
While I live by faith 
and do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, 
I’ve nothing now to fear;
With His manna He my hungry 
soul shall fill.


Then sweeping up to glory, 
we’ll see His blessed face, 
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll
Hallelujah!
He’s the Lily of the Valley, 
the Bright and Morning Star,
He’s the fairest of ten thousand 
to my soul."
84;HE CARETH FOR YOU;;"He careth for you,
He careth for you;
Through sunshine or shadow,
He careth for you."
85;WHEN I GET TO THE END;;"The sands have been washed in
 the footprints
Of the Stranger on Galilee’s shore, 
And the voice that subdued the
 rough billows, 
Will be heard in Judea no more.

But the path of that lone Galilean
With joy I will follow today
And the toils of the road will seem nothing, 
When I get to the end of the way, 
And the toils of the road will seem nothing, 
When I get to the end of the way.

There are so many hills to climb upward, 
I often am longing for rest, 
But He who appoints me my pathway, 
Knows just what is needful and best.

I know in His word He hath promised, 
That my strength, it shall be as my day.
And the toils of the road will seem nothing, 
When I get to the end of the way, 
And the toils of the road will seem nothing, 
When I get to the end of the way.

He loves me too well to forsake me 
Or give me one trial too much,
All His people have been dearly purchased, 
And Satan can never claim such, 

By and by I shall see Him and praise Him
In the city of unending day.
 And the toils of the road will seem nothing,
When I get to the end of the way,
And the toils of the road will seem nothing, 
When I get to the end of the way.

When the last feeble step has been taken, 
And the gates of that city appear, 
And the beautiful songs of the angels 
Float out on my listening ear.

When all that now seems so mysterious 
Will be bright and as clear as the day.
Then the toils of the road will seem nothing, 
When I get to the end of the way, 
Then the toils of the road will seem nothing
When I get to the end of the way."
86;ROOM AT THE CROSS;;"The cross upon which Jesus died 
Is a shelter in which we can hide,
And His grace so free is sufficient
for me, 
And deep is its fountain; 
as wide as the sea.

CHORUS
There's room at the cross for you,
There's room at the cross for you, 
Though millions have come, 
there's still room for one, 
Yes, there's room at the cross for you.

Though millions have found Him a friend
And have turned from the sins 
they have sinned, 
The Saviour still waits to open the gates,
And welcome a sinner before it’s too late.

The hand of my Saviour is strong
And the love of my Saviour is long, 
Through sunshine or rain, 
through loss or in gain, 
The blood flows from Calv’ry 
to cleanse every stain."
87;WHEN THE ROLL IS CALLED UP YONDER;;"When the trumpet of the Lord 
shall sound, and time shall be 
no more, 
And the morning breaks eternal, 
bright and fair;
When the saved of earth 
shall gather over on the other shore, 
And the roll is called up yonder,
 I’ll be there.

CHORUS
When the roll is called up yonder, 
When the roll is called up yonder, 
When the roll is called up yonder, 
When the roll is called up yonder, 
I’ll be there.

On that bright and cloudless morning
when the dead in Christ shall rise, 
And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather 
to their home beyond the skies, 
And the roll is called up yonder,
 I’ll be there.

Let us labor for the Master 
from the dawn till setting sun, 
Let us talk of all His wondrous 
love and care;
Then when all of life is over, 
and our work on earth is done, 
And the roll is called up yonder, 
I’ll be there."
88;THE HAVEN OF REST;;"My soul in sad exile 
was out on life’s sea, 
So burdened with sin 
and distressed, 
Till I heard a sweet 
voice saying, 
Make me your choice;
And I entered the 
Haven of  Rest!

CHORUS
I’ve anchored my soul 
In the haven of rest, 
I’ll sail the wild seas no more; 
The tempest may sweep o’er 
the wild, stormy deep, 
With Jesus I’m safe evermore.

I yielded myself to 
His tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word, 
My fetters fell off, 
and I anchored my soul;
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, 
since the Lord made me whole, 
Has been the old story, so blest, 
Of Jesus, who’ll save
whosoever will have 
A home in the Haven of Rest!

How precious the thought 
that we all may recline, 
Like John, the beloved and blest, 
On Jesus’ strong arm, 
where no tempest can harm, 
Secure in the Haven of Rest!

Oh come to the Saviour,
He patiently waits,
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul
in the Haven of rest,
And say, 
My Beloved is mine."
89;MUST JESUS BEAR THE CROSS  ALONE?;;"Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there’s a cross for every one,
And there’s a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I’ll bear,
Till death shall set me free,
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there’s a crown for me. 

Upon the crystal pavement down
At Jesus’ pierced feet,
With joy I’ll cast my golden crown,
And His dear name repeat.

Oh precious cross! Oh glorious crown!
Oh resurrection day!
Ye angels from the stars come down
And bear my soul away."
90;BLESSED BE THE NAME;;"All praise to Him who reigns above
In majesty supreme;
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem.

CHORUS
Blessed be the name, 
blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, 
blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

His name above all names 
shall stand, 
Exalted more and more, 
At God the Father’s own right
 hand, 
Where angel hosts adore.

Redeemer, Saviour, Friend of men
Once ruined by the fall;
Thou hast devised salvation’s plan,
For Thou hast died for all.


His name shall be the Counselor,
The Mighty Prince of Peace,
Of all earth’s kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease."
91;I'M GOING THROUGH;;"Lord, I have started to walk 
in the light, 
Shining upon me from heaven 
so bright; 
I bade the world and its follies 
adieu, 
I’ve started in Jesus and 
I’m going through.

CHORUS
I’m going through, yes, 
I’m going through, 
I’ll pay the price whatever 
others do, 
I’ll take the way with the Lord’s 
despised few, 
I’m going through Jesus, 
I’m going through.

Oh there are many who start 
in the race, 
But with the light 
refuse to keep pace; 
Others accept it because 
it is new, 
But not very many expect 
to go through.

I’d rather walk with Jesus 
alone,
Have for a pillow, 
like Jacob, a stone;
Living each moment with His 
face in view, 
Than shrink from my pathway 
and fail to go through.

O brother, now will you take up 
the cross?
Give up the world and count 
it as dross;
Sell all thou hast and give to
the poor’
Then go through with Jesus and 
those who endure."
92;SPEAK, MY LORD;;"Hear the Lord of harvest 
sweetly calling, 
Who will go and work for 
Me today?
Who will bring to Me the 
lost and dying?
Who will point them to 
the narrow way?

CHORUS
Speak, my Lord, speak, 
my Lord
Speak, and I'll be quick to
answer Thee;
Speak, my Lord, speak, my
Lord
Speak, and I will answer,
Lord, send me?

When the coal of fire 
touched the prophet, 
Making him as pure as pure 
can be, 
When the voice of God, said 
Who’ll go for us?
Then he answered, 
Here I am, send me.

Millions now in sin and 
shame are dying
Listen to their sad and bitter cry; 
Hasten, brother, 
hasten to the rescue;
Quickly answer, Master, here am I.

Soon the time for reaping 
will be over;
Soon we’ll gather for the harvest 
home;
May the Lord of harvest smile 
upon us, 
May we hear His blessed, 
Child, well done."
93;OH LOVE OF GOD;;"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

CHORUS
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure?
How measureless and strong?
It shall forevermore endure
The saints and angels song.

When hoary time shall pass away, 
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who hear refuse to pray, 
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God’s love so sure, shall still endure
All measureless and strong; 
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race 
The saints’ and angels’ song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."
94;THE MEETING IN THE AIR;;"You have heard of little Moses 
in the bulrush, 
You have heard of fearless David 
and his sling; 
You have heard the story told of 
dreaming Joseph,
And of Jonah and the whale you 
often sing.
There are many, many others 
through the Bible, 
I should like to meet them all, 
I do declare
By and by the Lord will surely 
let us meet them
At the meeting in the air.

CHORUS
There is going to be a meeting in the air, 
In the sweet, sweet by and by; 
I am going to meet you, meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky; 
Such singing you will hear, 
never heard by mortal ear, 
Twill be glorious, I do declare 
And God’s own Son 
will be the leading One
At the meeting in the air.

Many things will there be missing, 
in that meeting
For the mourners bench will have 
no place at all;
There will never be a sermon 
preached to sinners, 
For the sinner had refused to 
heed the call
There will be no mourning over 
wayward loved ones, 
There will be no lonely nights of 
pleading prayer;
All our burdens and our anguish 
will be lifted
At the meeting in the air.

There the doubters will be missing 
altogether, 
All the skeptics will be absent on that day;
There will be no grumblers present 
to disturb us, 
And the Achans will be busy 
far away, 
There the saints will have His seal 
upon their foreheads,
Dressed in raiment none but ransomed 
ones can wear; 
All who have the wedding garments 
will be present 
At the meeting in the air."
95;IT'S DRIPPING WITH BLOOD;;"The first one to die for 
this Holy Ghost plan, 
Was John the Baptist, 
but he died like a man;
Then came the Lord Jesus, 
they crucified Him, 
He taught that the Spirit 
would save men from sin.

CHORUS
It’s dripping with blood, yes, 
it’s dripping with blood, 
This Holy Ghost Gospel is 
dripping with blood, 
The blood of disciples, who 
died for the Truth, 
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
is dripping with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, 
and John the divine, 
They gave up their lives 
so this Gospel could shine;
They mingled their blood,
like the prophets of old, 
So the true Word of God 
could honestly be told.

Then they stoned Stephen, 
he preached against sin, 
He made them so angry,
they dashed his head in; 
But he died in the Spirit, 
and gave up the ghost, 
And went to join others, 
in that life-giving host.

There’s souls under the altar, 
crying, how long?
For the Lord to punish those 
who’ve done wrong; 
But there’s going to be more 
who’ll give their life’s blood 
For this Holy Ghost Gospel 
and its crimson flood."
96;HOLY, HOLY, HOLY;;"Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of
hosts,
Heaven and earth are full of Thee,
Heaven and earth are praising
Thee,
Oh Lord Most High."
97;THIS WORLD CAN’T HOLD ME;;"This old world can never hold me,
Any moment I’ll be gone,
For I’ve made my consecration,
And I have the wedding garment on."
98;OUR LORD'S RETURN;;"I am watching for the coming
of the glad millennial day, 
When our blessed Lord 
shall come and catch 
His waiting Bride away; 
Oh! My heart is filled with 
rapture as I labor, 
watch and pray, 
For our Lord is coming back 
to earth again.

CHORUS
Oh! Our Lord is coming back 
to earth again, 
Yes, our Lord is coming back 
to earth again, 
Satan will be bound a thousand 
years, we’ll have no tempter then,
After Jesus shall come back 
to earth again.

Jesus’ coming back will be 
the answer to earth’s sorr’wing cry, 
For the knowledge of the Lord 
shall fill the earth and sea and sky; 
God shall take away all sickness 
and the suff’rer’s tears will dry, 
When our Saviour shall come 
back to earth again.

Yes, the ransomed of the Lord 
shall come to Zion then with joy, 
And in all His holy mountain 
nothing hurts or shall destroy; 
Perfect peace shall reign in every 
heart, and love without alloy, 
After Jesus shall come back 
to earth again.

Then the sin and sorrow, 
pain and death of this dark 
world shall cease, 
In a glorious reign with Jesus 
of a thousand years of peace; 
All the earth is groaning, 
crying for that day of sweet release, 
For our Jesus to come 
back to earth again."
99;I SHALL KNOW HIM;;"Standing somewhere in the 
shadows you’ll find Jesus, 
He’s the One who always 
cares and understands;
Standing somewhere in the 
shadows you will find Him, 
And you’ll know Him by the 
nail prints in His hands.

CHORUS
I shall know Him, 
I shall know Him, 
As redeemed by His side 
I shall stand; 
I shall know Him, 
I shall know Him
By the prints of the nails 
In His hands."
100;THEN JESUS CAME;;"One sat alone beside 
the highway begging, 
His eyes were blind, 
the light he could not see; 
He clutched his rags 
and shivered in the shadows, 
Then Jesus came 
and bade his darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the 
tempter’s pow’r is broken; 
When Jesus comes the 
tears are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and
fills the life with glory, 
For all is changed when
Jesus comes to stay.

From home and friends
the evil spirits drove him, 
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery, 
He cut himself as demon pow’rs 
possessed him, Then Jesus came 
and set the captive free.

Unclean! unclean! the leper
cried in torment, 
The deaf, the dumb,
in helplessness stood near; 
The fever raged, disease had 
gripped its victim 
Then Jesus came and
cast out every fear.

So men today have found 
the Saviour able, 
They could not 
conquer passion, lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them 
sad and lonely, 
Then Jesus came and dwelt 
Himself within."
101;WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS;;"When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.


Forbid it Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me
most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from his head, his hands, 
his feet, 
Sorrow and love flow mingled down; 
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet, 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature
mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all!"
102;THE WATER WAY;;"Long ago the maids drew 
water In the evening time, 
they say.
 One day Isaac sent his servant
 To stop Rebekah on her way. 
My master sent me here to tell thee;
See these jewels rich and rare; 
Would’st thou not his lovely bride be
In that country over there?

CHORUS
It shall be light In the evening time, 
The path to glory you will find;
Thru the water way, 
It Is the light today, 
Buried In the precious 
Name of Jesus Christ. 
Young and old, repent 
of all your sin, 
The Holy Ghost will surely 
enter in
The evening Light has come, 
It is a fact that God and Christ are one.

So God’s servants come to tell you
Of a Bridegroom in the sky,
Looking for a holy people
To be His bride soon, by and by;
He sends to us refreshing water
In this wondrous latter day;
They who really will be raptured
Must go thru the water way.

Are you on your way to ruin,
Cumbered with a load of care?
See the quick work God is doing
That so His glory you may share.
At last the faith He once delivered
To the saints, is ours today;
To get in the Church triumphant
You must go the water way.

Have you looked and often
wondered
Why the power is slack today?
Will you stay in that back number
And go on in the man-made way?
Oh saints who never have been
buried
In the blessed name of God,
Let the truth now sanctify you;
It’s the way apostles trod."
103;DON'T FORGET PRAYER;;"Don’t forget the family prayer,
Jesus wants to meet you there;
He wilt take your every care,
Oh, don’t forget the family prayer."
104;STAND ON THAT ROCK;;"Crying Holy unto the Lord,
Crying Holy unto the Lord,
If I could, I surely would
Stand on that rock where Moses
stood."
105;OH THAT MAN FROM GALILEE;;"In a manger long ago, 
I know it’s really so, 
A Babe was born to save 
men from their sin.
John saw Him on that 
shore, 
The Lamb forevermore, 
Oh, Christ, the Crucified of Calvary.

CHORUS
Oh, I love that Man from Galilee, 
from Galilee, 
For He’s done so 
very much for me.
He’s forgiven all my sins, 
placed the Holy Ghost within; 
Oh, I love, I love that Man
from Galilee.

The publican went to pray in 
the temple there one day, 
He cried, O Lord, be merciful to me!
He was forgiven of every sin, 
and a deep peace placed within; 
He said, Come see this Man 
from Galilee.

The lame was made to walk, 
the dumb was made to talk, 
That power was spoken with 
love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man 
from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
to know the way of right, 
He asked the Son of man 
what must he do.
These words He said to him, 
Ye must be born again,
By the Spirit of that Man from 
Galilee.

The woman at the well, 
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands 
she had at that time.
She was forgiven of every sin, 
and a deep peace came within; 
Then she cried, Come see that 
Man from Galilee!"
106;REACH OUT, TOUCH THE LORD;F;"Reach out and touch the Lord 
as He passes by, 
You'll find He’s not too 
busy to hear your 
heart’s cry; 
He’s passing by 
this moment, your needs to supply, 
Reach out and touch the Lord 
as He goes by."
107;IN THAT CITY, LAMB IS LIGHT;;"There's a country far beyond
 the starry sky, 
There’s a city where there 
never comes a night;
If we’re faithful we shall go 
there by and by
It's the city where the Lamb 
is the light.

CHORUS
In that city where the Lamb 
is the light, 
The city where there cometh 
no night;
I’ve a mansion over there, and 
when free from toil and care, 
I am going where the Lamb 
is the light.

Here we have our days of 
sunshine, but we know 
That the sun which shines 
upon us now so bright
Will be changed to clouds and 
rain until we go
To the city where the Lamb is 
the light.

There the flowers bloom forever 
and the day
Shall be one eternal day without 
a night;
And our tears shall be forever 
wiped away, 
In that city where the Lamb 
is the light.

Here we have our 
disappointments all the while, 
And our fondest hopes but 
meet with bitter blight; 
Though by night we weep, 
the morning brings a smile, 
In that city where the Lamb 
is the light.

Then let sunlight fade, 
let twilight bring its gloom, 
Not a shadow can my blissful 
soul affright;
For I know that up in heaven 
there is room, 
In that city where the Lamb 
is the light."
108;JESUS SET ME FREE;;"I'm so glad Jesus set me free,
I'm so glad Jesus set me free,
I'm so glad Jesus set me free.
I'm singing glory hallelujah, 
Jesus set me free.

The devil had me bound but
Jesus set me free
The devil had me bound but
Jesus set me free
The devil had me bound but
Jesus set me free
I'm singing glory hallelujah, 
Jesus set me free.

I'm on my way to Heaven,
shouting victory
I'm on my way to Heaven,
shouting victory
I'm on my way to Heaven,
shouting victory
I'm singing glory hallelujah, 
Jesus set me free."
109;WHEN I TAKE MY VACATION;;"Here so many are taking vacation, 
To the mountains, 
the lakes or the sea;
Where they rest from their cares 
and their worries, 
What a wonderful time that must be! 
But it seems not my lot to be like them, 
I must toil thru the heat and the cold, 
Seeking out the lost sheep on the mountains, 
Bringing wanderers back to the fold.

CHORUS
When I take my vacation In heaven
What a wonderful time that will be;
Hearing concerts by the heavenly Chorus,
And the face of my Saviour I’ll see,
Sitting down by the banks of the river; 
‘Neath the shade of the ever green tree, 
I shaIl rest from my burdens forever, 
Won’t you spend your vacation with me.

Now some day I shall take my vacation, 
To the city John tells us about; 
With its foundation walls all so precious, 
Where from gladness of heart I shall shout! 
Oh no sights ever witnessed by mortals.
Can compare with the glories up there
I shall spend my vacation with Jesus, 
In the place He went on to prepare.

There the weather will always be perfect, 
Not a cloud shall sweep over the sky
And no earthquakes or cyclones shall threaten, 
In the land of the Sweet by and by
Soon there’s going to be an excursion,
I am booked for a ride in the air, 
You’re invited to share my vacation, 
And the feast with our Bridegroom to share.

Here on earth we take our vacation, 
We return to our homes by and by; 
When I take my vacation in heaven, 
In those mansions of gold in the sky, 
I shall dwell with my Saviour forever, 
With Him sit on His Heavenly Throne; 
All the days will be one, long vacation, 
When my Saviour takes me to His home."
110;OH, IT IS JESUS;;"Oh, it is Jesus! Yes, it is Jesus!
It is Jesus in my soul;
For I have touched the hem of His
garment,
And His blood has made me whole."
111;WHAT THEN?;;"When the great plants of our cities 
have turned out their last finished work, 
When our merchants have sold 
their last yard of goods and dismissed 
the last tired clerk; 
When our banks have raked in their 
last dollar 
And paid the last dividends, 
When the Judge of the earth says, 
closed for the night,
And asks for a balance 
What Then?

CHORUS
What then, What then? 
When the great Book is opened, what then?
When the ones that’s rejecting 
this Message tonight, 
Will be asked to give a reason - 
What Then?

When the choir has sung its last song 
and the preacher has said his last prayer, 
When the people have heard their last 
sermon 
And the sound has died out in the air, 
When the Bible lies closed on the altar 
And the pews are all empty of folks, 
And each one stands facing his record 
And the great Book is opened  
What Then?

When the actors have played their last drama 
And the mimic has made his last fun, 
When the film has flashed its last film 
And the billboard displayed its last run, 
When the crowds seeking pleasure have vanished 
And all the liquor stores and beer joints have been closed, 
And the salesman sold his last drink
And gone out in the darkness, 
When the trumpet of ages is sounded 
And we stand before Him 
What Then?

When the bugle call sinks into silence 
and the long marching columns stand still, 
And the captain repeats his last orders, 
And the flag has been hauled from the mast, 
And the wounded afield checked in 
and a world that rejects its Saviour 
is asked for a reason - 
What Then?"
112;FAITH IN JEHOVAH;;"Faith in the Father, faith In the Son, 
Faith in the Holy Ghost, 
these three are One; 
Demons will tremble, 
and sinners awake; 
Faith in Jehovah makes anything shake."
113;LEAVE IT THERE;F;"If the world from you withhold 
of its silver and its gold, 
And you have to get along 
with meager fare, 
Just remember, in His word, 
how He feeds the little bird; 
Take your burden to the Lord 
and leave it there.

CHORUS
Leave it there, leave it there, 
Take your burden to the Lord 
and leave it there; 
If you trust and never doubt, 
He will surely bring you out; 
Take your burden to the Lord 
and leave it there.

If your body suffers pain 
and your health you can’t regain, 
And your soul is almost sinking in 
despair, 
Jesus knows the pain you feel, 
He can save and He can heal 
Take your burden to the Lord 
and leave it there.

When your enemies assail 
and your heart begins to fail, 
Don’t forget that God in heaven 
answers prayer;
He will make a way for you 
and will lead you safely through; 
Take your burden to the Lord 
and leave it there.

When your youthful days are gone 
and old age is stealing on, 
And your body bends beneath 
the weight of care;
He will never leave you then, 
He’ll go with you to the end; 
Take your burden to the Lord 
and leave it there."
114;I CAN, I WILL I DO BELIEVE;;"I can, I will, I do believe;
I can, I will, I do believe;
I can, I will, I do believe
That Jesus heals me now. 
(I’m trusting only in the Lord...)"
115;ISN'T HE WONDERFUL!;;"Isn't He wonderful, wonderful, wonderful?
Isn’t Jesus my Lord wonderful? 
Eyes have seen, ears have heard, 
what’s recorded in God’s Word; 
Isn’t Jesus my Lord wonderful?"
116;THE LIFEBOAT;;"We're floating down the stream 
of time,
We have not long to stay;
The stormy clouds of darkness
Will turn to brightest day,
Then let us all take courage,
For we’re not left alone;
The lifeboat soon is coming
To gather the Jewels home.

CHORUS
Then cheer, my brother cheer,
Our trials will soon be o’er,
Our loved ones we shall meet,
shall meet,
Upon the golden shore,
We’re pilgrims and we’re
strangers here.,
We’re seeking a city to come,
The lifeboat soon is coming,
To gather the jewels home.

Sometimes the Devil tempts me,
And says it’s all in vain
To try to live a Christian life
And walk in Jesus’ Name;
But then we hear the Master say,
I’ll lend you a helping hand,
And if you’ll only trust Me,
I'll guide you to that land.

The lifeboat soon is coming, 
By eyes of faith I see 
As she sweeps through the waters 
To rescue you and me,
 And land us safely in the port 
With friends we love so dear. 
Get ready, cries the Captain; 
Oh, look, she’s almost here,

Oh, now’s the time to get on board,
While she is passing by;
But if you stand and wait too long,
You shall forever die;
The fare is paid for one and all,
The Captain bids you come,
And get on board the lifeboat,
She’ll carry you safely home."
117;IT SHALL FLOW LIKE A RIVER;;"It shall flow like a river, 
It shall fall like the rain, 
It shall rise as the dew 
in morning o’er the plain; 
For the knowledge of the 
Lord shall fill all the earth 
When the Spirit of the Lord 
shall fall.

Flow, river, flow, flow, river, flow; 
Flow out through the nations 
wherever man may go; 
Cause life to spring forth, 
that all men may know
That You’re the river of the Spirit; 
Oh, flow, river, flow."
118;THE GREAT JUDGMENT;;"I dreamed that the great judgment morning
Had dawned, and the trumpet had blown;
I dreamed that the nations had gathered
To judgment before the white throne;
From the throne came a bright shining angel, 
And stood on the land and the sea,
 And swore with his hand raised to heaven, 
That time was no longer to be.

CHORUS
And Oh, what a weeping and wailing, 
As the lost were told of their fate; 
They cried for the rocks and the mountains, 
They prayed, but their prayers were too late.

The rich man was there, but his money
Had melted and vanished away; 
A pauper he stood in the judgment, 
His debts were too heavy to pay; 
The great man was there, but his greatness, 
When death came, was left far behind.
The angel that opened the records, 
Not a trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there with the orphans, 
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven forever, 
God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
The gambler was there and the drunkard, 
And the man that had sold them the drink, 
With the people who gave him the license, 
Together in hell they did sink.

The moral man came to the judgment, 
But his self-righteous rags would not do;
The men who had crucified Jesus
Had passed off as a moral men, too;
The soul that had put off salvation,
Not tonight; I'll get saved by and by,
No time now to think of religion!
At last they had found time to die."
119;I HAVE CROSSED;;"I have crossed the riven veil 
where the glory never fails, 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah;
I have crossed the riven veil 
where the glory never fails 
For I’m living in the presence 
of the King."
120;ROOM AT THE FOUNTAIN;;"I heard my loving Saviour say, 
There's room at the fountain for thee, 
Come, wash the stains of sin away,
There’s room at the fountain for thee.

CHORUS
Room, room, yes, there is room,
Room at the fountain for thee
Room, room, yes, there is room,
There’s room at the fountain for
thee.

I came to Him, my sins confessed, 
There was room at the fountain for me;
When I gave up, my heart was blest, 
There’s room at the fountain for thee.

I plunged beneath the crimson tide, 
There was room at the fountain for me;
And now by faith am sanctified, 
There’s room at the fountain for thee.

I found the crimson stream I know, 
There was room at the fountain for me;
His blood has washed me white as snow’
There’s room at the fountain for thee.

He cleansed my heart from inbred sin, 
There was room at the fountain for me;
And now He keeps me pure within, 
There’s room at the fountain for me.

I’ll praise Him while He gives me breath, 
There was room at the fountain for me;
He saved me from an awful death, 
There’s room at the fountain for thee.

His blood was shed but once for all, 
There was room at the fountain for me;
Oh, don’t reject sweet Mercy’s call, 
There’s room at the fountain for thee.

We’ll sing with all the saints above, 
There was room at the fountain for me;
And praise Him for redeeming love, 
There’s room at the fountain for thee."
121;COME AND GO WITH ME;;"Come and go with me to my
Father’s House,
To my Father’s House, to my
Father’s House.
Come and go with me to my
Father’s House,
Where there’s peace, peace, peace."
122;JUST ANOTHER TOUCH;;"Just another touch, Lord, from You,
To help in hard trials I go through;
Though dark may be the night,
You’ve sent a ray of light,
When I get a touch, Lord; from You."
123;THE PEARLY WHITE CITY;;"There's a holy and beautiful city,
Whose builder and ruler is God.
John saw it descending from
heaven
When Patmos, in exile, he trod;
Its high, massive wall is of jasper,
The city itself is pure gold;
And when my frail tent here is
folded,

CHORUS
Mine eyes shall its glory behold.
In that bright city, pearly white city, 
I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown;
Now I am watching, waiting and longing, 
For the white city John saw coming down.

No sin is allowed in that city,
And nothing defiling nor mean;
No pain and no sickness can enter,
No crape on the doorknob is seen;
Earth’s sorrows and cares are
forgotten,
No tempter is there to annoy;
No parting words ever are spoken,
There’s nothing to hurt and destroy.

No heartaches are known in that city, 
No tears ever moisten the eye, 
There’s no disappointment in heaven,
No envy and strife in the sky;
The saints are all sanctified wholly,
They live in sweet harmony there;
My heart is now set on that city,
And some day its blessings I’ll share.

My loved ones are gathering yonder,
My friends, too, are passing away;
And soon I shall join their bright
number,
And dwell in eternity’s day;
They’re safe now in glory with Jesus,
Their trials and battles are past;
They overcame sin and the tempter,
They’ve reached that fair city at last."
124;JUST A CLOSER WALK;;"I am weak but Thou are strong,
Jesus keep me from all wrong;
I’ll be satisfied as long,
As I walk let me walk close to Thee.

CHORUS
Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it Jesus is my plea;
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Thru this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none
but Thee.

When my feeble life is o’er,
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o’er,
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore."
125;THE MESSAGE OF HIS COMING;;"We're looking for His coming,
 in the clouds of heaven,
 Coming back to earth 
to catch away His own;
Then may we all be ready, 
when midnight cry is given, 
To go and reign with 
Christ on His throne.

CHORUS
Gladly may we herald the message 
of His blessed appearing, 
Soon He’s coming In glory, 
tell to one and all; 
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, 
why slumber when the end is nearing,
But get ready for the final call.

We’re longing for the glory 
that awaits the faithful, 
Who shall overcome, 
and every conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward, 
the prize is life eternal
To all who win the fight over sin.

We’re praying for the advent 
of our blessed Saviour, 
Who has promised life to all 
who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending,
the message being given, 
And soon we’ll see 
our Lord face to face.

We see the signs appearing 
of His blessed coming, 
Lo, behold the fig leaves 
now becoming green; 
The gospel of His kingdom 
has gone to every nation; 
That we are near the end 
can be seen."
126;THE SHEEP OP HIS PASTURE;;"The sheep of His pasture 
have gathered
To hear what the Shepherd 
would say, 
His voice like the sound of 
slow waters, 
Came rippling through vessels 
of clay.


As the voice that brought forth 
creation
And set all the stars in array,
And speaks words of Life and 
of wisdom, 

In the midst of His people today.
Through prophets, by precious blood
purchased,
Cleansed and surrendered and filled.
And set in the Body for service,
As the Head of the Body hath willed."
127;ARE YOU WASHED IN THE BLOOD;;"Have you been to Jesus 
for the cleansing pow’r?
Are you washed in the 
blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting 
in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the 
blood of the Lamb?

CHORUS
Are you washed in the blood, 
In the soul-cleansing 
blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless? 
Are they white as snow? 
Are you washed In the blood
 of the Lamb?

Are you walking daily 
by the Saviour’s side?
Are you washed in the blood 
of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment 
in the Crucified?
Are you washed in the blood 
of the Lamb?

When the Bridegroom cometh, 
will your robes be white, 
Pure and white in the blood 
of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready 
for the mansions bright 
And be washed in the blood 
of the Lamb?

Lay aside the garments 
that are stained with sin,
And be washed in the blood 
of the Lamb?
There’s a fountain flowing 
for the soul unclean, 
Oh, be washed in the blood 
of the Lamb."
128;JESUS LOVES ME;;"Jesus loves me this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak but He is strong.

CHORUS
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me He who died,
Heaven’s gates to open wide;
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in.

Jesus loves me loves me still,
Though I’m very weak and ill;
From His shining throne on high,
Comes to watch me where I lie."
129;BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY;;"Have you been baptized into the
Body?
Baptized with the Holy Ghost;
There is but one way to enter in it,
Just as they did on Pentecost.

CHORUS
Are you in the Church
triumphant?
Are you in the Saviour’s Bride?
Come and be baptized Into the
Body,
And forevermore abide.

There is but one Church, Bride
and Body,
And into it we’re all baptized;
By the one, true, promised Holy
Spirit;
Though by the world we’re all
despised.

Every creed has claimed 
to be the Body, 
But the plumb line proved untrue 
All their dreams, for God has 
so determined 
To bring His Son’s true Bride 
to view.

Many thought that they were 
in the Body, 
Till the Holy Ghost had come; 
When the Word of God was 
opened to them, 
They entered in, and yet 
there’s room.

Those who died before the Holy
Spirit
Came upon us from on high,
May, by faith with Saints of old
departed,
Arise to meet Him in the sky.

When the Bridegroom comes, 
will you be ready; 
And your vessel all filled and bright?
You will be among the foolish virgins
If you do not walk in the light."
130;THIS IS LIKE HEAVEN TO ME;;"We find many people who can’t
understand
Why we are so happy and free;
We’ve crossed over Jordan to
Canaan’s fair land
And this is like Heaven to me.

CHORUS
Oh, this Is like Heaven to me,
(Praise God!)
Yes, this is like Heaven to me;
I've crossed over Jordan to
Canaan’s fair land,
And this is like Heaven to me.


Oh, when I get happy, 
I sing and I shout
The devil don’t believe It, I see; 
But I’m filled with the Spirit, 
there isn’t a doubt, 
And that’s what’s the matter
 with me."
131;WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE;;"Brother a-far from the 
Saviour today, 
Risking your soul 
for the things that decay, 
Oh, if today God should 
call it away,
What would you give 
in exchange for your soul?

CHORUS
What would you give? 
What would you give? 
What would you give 
in exchange for your soul? 
Oh, if today God should call it away, 
What would you give 
in exchange for your soul?

Mercy is calling you, 
won’t you give heed?
Must the dear Saviour 
still tenderly plead?
Risk not your soul,

When He reached down 
His hand for me, 
When He reached down 
His hand for me;

without God or His Son, 
When He reached down 
His hand for me, for me.

I was nearing despair, 
when He came to me there, 
And He showed me that I 
could be free;
Then He lifted my feet, 
gave me glory complete, 
When He reached down 
His hand for me, for me.

How my heart doth rejoice 
since I made Him my choice, 
From the tempest to Him now I flee;
Now I lean on His arm, 
I’m secure from all harm, 
Since He reached down 
His hand for me, for me.

Since the Lord gave me peace, 
heavenly joys never cease; 
Lord, I give all my life unto Thee; 
Guide my feet, hold my hand, 
grant with Thee I may stand, 
For you reached down your 
hand for me, for me."

Help Him the wand’ring

Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art,

When through the woods 
and forest glades I wander 
And hear the birds 
sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down 
from lofty mountain grandeur 
And hear the brook 
and feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God,
 His Son not sparing, 
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
my burden gladly bearing, 
He bled and died 
to take away my sin.

When Christ shall come 
with shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow
 in humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
my God, how great Thou art!"

grace;
In every high 
and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within 
the veil.

His oath, His covenant, 
His blood, Support me in 
the whelming flood;
When all around my soul 
gives way, He then is all 
my hope and stay.

in Him be found; 
Dressed in His righteousness 
alone, 
Faultless to stand 
before the throne."

God is our strength, 
God is a very present help in 
trouble.
Therefore will not we fear,

Though the waters thereof roar
There is a river, the streams whereof 
make glad, make glad the city, 
City of God


God is in the midst in the midst of her;
He shall help her she shall not be moved
The LORD of hosts is with us;

I will be exalted in the earth.

143;WHEN WE SEE CHRIST;;"Oft times the day seems long, 
our trials hard to bear; 
We’re tempted to complain, 
to murmur and despair;
But Christ will soon appear, 
to catch His bride away, 
All tears forever over, 
in God’s eternal day.

CHORUS
It will be worth It all, 
when we see Jesus;
Life’s trials will seem so small, 
when we see Christ, 
One glimpse of His dear face, 
all sorrow will cease, 
So bravely run the race till we see Christ.

Sometimes the sky looks dark, 
with not a ray of light; 
We’re tossed and driven on, 
no human help in sight; 
But there is One in heaven, 
who knows our deepest care, 
Let Jesus solve your problem, 
just go to Him in prayer.

Life’s day will soon be o’er, 
all storms forever past; 
We’ll cross the great divide, 
to glory safe at last; 
We’ll share the joys of heaven, 
a harp, a home, a crown; 
The tempter will be banished, 
we’ll lay our burden down."
144;WHITER THAN THE SNOW;;"Blessed be the Fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God;
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Though I’ve wandered far from His
fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than snow!
Whiter than snow!
Wash me in the blood of the
Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me
Water cannot wash them away,
Jesus, to that Fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."
145;ALL HAIL JESUS NAME;;"All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ name
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all

Ye seed of Israel’s Chosen race
Ye ransom from the fall;
Hail Him, who saves you by His
grace 
And crown Him Lord of all; 
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all.

Let every kindred, every tribe,
On this terrestial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all;
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Oh that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall,
We’ll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all;
We’ll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all."
146;AT THE CROSS;;"Alas! And did my Saviour bleed,
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

CHORUS
At the Cross, at the cross 
where I first saw the light, 
And the burden of my heart
 rolled away, 
It was there by faith I received 
my sight, 
And now I am happy all the day!

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity, grace unknown,
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
 And shut his glories in, 
When Christ, the Mighty Maker,
 died
For man, the creature’s sin.

But drops of grief can ne’er repay
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord I give myself away
Tis all that I can do!"
147;THE GREAT I AM;;"I Am spoke to Moses in the 
burning bush of fire, 
I AM the God of Abraham, 
the Bright and Morning Star 
I AM the Rose of Sharon, 
from beginning whence I came; 
I AM the whole creation, 
and Jesus is My Name.

CHORUS
Oh, who do you say I am, 
and whence do you say I came, 
Do you know the Father, 
and can you tell His Name? 
In Jesus dwells the fullness 
of the Godhead, 
don’t you see; 
Jesus is the great I AM, 
and the Lord of Lord is He.

I AM was before old Abraham, 
He rejoiced to see My day.
When Jesus spoke 
these precious words, 
they stoned Him right away, 
Why do you stone Me?
Jesus said, in a holy, 
sweet command. 
Because you say 
you’re the great I AM,
we believe you’re just a man.

It was on the Day of Pentecost, 
oh, how the fire did fall;
The Holy Ghost descended 
and filled them one and all; 
Then Peter told the multitude, 
Repent of all your sins.
About three thousand souls 
were buried in Jesus’ 
precious Name."
148;ALMOST PERSUADED;;"Almost persuaded
now to believe; 
Almost persuaded
Christ to receive;
Seems now some
soul to say, Go, Spirit, go Thy way;
Some more convenient day, 
on Thee I’ll call,

Almost persuaded.
Come, come today;
Almost persuaded,
turn not away;
Jesus invites you here, 
Angels are ling’ring near, 
Prayers rise from hearts so dear; 
Oh wand’rer, come.

Almost persuaded, harvest is past!
Almost persuaded, 
doom comes at last!
Almost cannot avail; 
Almost is but to fail!
Sad, sad, that bitter wail: 
Almost but lost!"
149;NO DISAPPOINTMENT;;"There's no disappointment in heaven, 
No weariness, sorrow or pain; 
No hearts that are bleeding and broken,
No song with a minor refrain. 
The clouds of our earthly horizon 
Will never appear in the sky, 
For all will be sunshine and gladness,
With never a sob nor a sigh.

CHORUS
I'm bound for that beautiful city
My Lord has prepared for His own;
Where all the redeemed of all ages
Sing Glory! around the white throne;
Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven, 
And the glories I there shall behold:
What a joy that will be when my Saviour
 I see,
 In that beautiful city of gold!

We’ll never pay rent for our mansion,
The taxes will never come due; 
Our garments will never grow threadbare, 
But always be fadeless and new. 
We’ll never be hungry nor thirsty, 
Nor languish in poverty there, 
For all the rich bounties of heaven 
His sanctified children will share.

There’ll never be crape on the
doorknob,
No funeral train in the sky;
No graves on the hillsides of glory,
For there we shall nevermore die.
The old will be young there forever,
Transformed in a moment of time;
Immortal we’ll stand in His likeness,
The stars and the sun to outshine."
150;HAPPY DAY;;"Oh happy day, that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Saviour and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice
And tell its raptures all abroad.

CHORUS
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray, 
And live rejoicing every day, 
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away!

Oh happy bond, that seals my vows
To Him who merits all my love!
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,
While to that sacred shrine I move.

Tis done; the great transaction’s done!
I am my Lord’s and He is mine; 
He drew me, and I followed on, 
Charmed to confess the voice divine."
151;ONE OF THEM;;"There are people almost everywhere, 
Whose hearts are all aflame, 
With the fire that fell at Pentecost, 
Which cleansed and made them clean;
It is burning now within my heart, 
All glory to His name!
I’m so glad that I can say I’m one of them.

CHORUS
One of them, one of them, 
I’m so glad that I can say I’m one of them.
One of them, one of them 
I’m so glad that I can say I’m one of them.

Though these people may not learned be,
Nor boast of worldly fame,
They have all received their Pentecost,
Baptized in Jesus’ name; 
And are telling now, both far and wide, 
His power is yet the same, 
Im so glad that I can say I’m one of them.

They were gathered in the upper room,
All praying in His name,
They were baptized with the HolyGhost,
And pow’r for service came;
Now what He did for them that day
He’ll do for you the same,
I’m so glad that I can say I’m one of them.

Come, my brother, seek this blessing
That will cleanse your heart from sin, 
That will start the joy-bells ringing 
And will keep the soul aflame; 
It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His name.
I’m so glad that I can say I’m one of them."
152;I'LL BE LISTENING;;"When the Saviour calls I will answer, 
When He calls for me I will hear; 
When the Saviour calls I will answer
I’ll be somewhere list’ning for my name.

CHORUS
I’ll be somewhere list'ning
 I’ll be somewhere list’ning, 
I’ll be somewhere list'ning for my name; 
I'llbe somewhere list’ning, 
I'll be somewhere Iist’ning, 
I’ll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

If my heart is right when He calls me,
If my heart is right I will hear;
If my heart is right when He calls me,
I’ll be somewhere list’ning for my
name.

If my robe is white when He calls me,
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my
name."
153;THE HOMECOMING WEEK;;"Upon our journey here below 
we meet with pain and loss; 
Sometimes there is a crown of thorns, 
sometimes the heavy cross, 
The dreary road to Calvary, 
the bitter goad and sting, 
But what’s inside those gates of pearl 
Will be worth everything.

CHORUS
When we're inside the gates of pearl
we'll learn a lot of things,
We’ll have, a harp that’s made of gold
perhaps a thousand strings; 
We’ll sing and shout and dance about
The Lamb will dry our tears; 
We’ll have a grand homecoming week
The first ten thousand years.

The shadows now begin to fall, 
the time is drawing nigh,
When Christ our Lord shall come again 
like lightning from the sky. 
And while we wait and suffer here, 
praise God, we'll shout and sing, 
For one glimpse through those gates of pearl 
will be worth everything.

The precious blood of God’s own Son 
has saved and sanctified 
A wondrous people for His name 
and they are called the bride. 
Though here neglected and despised, 
one day the Lord will bring 
His chosen ones within the gates, 
and that’s worth everything."
154;JUST AS I AM;;"Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for
me,
And that Thou bidd’st me come to
Thee,
Oh Lamb of God, I come I come!

Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee, whose blood can cleanse
each spot,
Oh Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse,
relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
Oh Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down,
Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
Oh Lamb of God, I come, I come!"
155;PEACE IN THE VALLEY;;"Well, I'm tired and so weary 
but I must go along;
Till the Lord comes and calls 
me away, oh, yes;
Well the morning is bright, 
and the Lamb is the Light;
And the night, night is as 
fair as the day, oh, yes.

CHORUS
There will be peace 
In the valley for me some day;
there will be peace 
In the valley for me, 
Oh, Lord, I pray; 
There’ll be no sadness, 
no sorrow, no trouble I’ll see; 
There will be peace
 in the valley for me.

There the flow'rs will be blooming, 
and the grass will be green;
And the skies will be clear and
serene, oh, yes;
Well the sun ever beams,
in this valley of dreams;
And no clouds there 
will ever be seen, oh, yes.

Well, the bear will be gentle, 
and the wolf will be tame; 
And the lion shall lay down 
by the lamb, oh, yes;
Well the beast from the wild, 
shall be led by a little child,
 And I’ll be changed, changed
 from this creature that I am, oh, yes."
156;GREAT IS THE LORD;;"There is a Name I love to hear, 
it falls like music on my ear, 
It’s the Name of Jesus Christ the Lord;
He came from the Father in Heaven above,
 He died on the cross just to show us His love; 
Jesus, yes, Jesus is His Name.

CHORUS
Great is the Lord! Great Is the Lord!
Great Is the Father, great Is the Son 
Great Is the Holy Ghost, 
and these three are One;
Jesus, yea,  Jesus Is His Name.

He is the dear Saviour of men, He gave
His own life just to free us from sin, 
It’s the Name of Jesus Christ the Lord;
The wonderful Counselor, 
the Man from Galilee,
He calmed the angry waters 
and He walked on the sea; 
Jesus, yes, Jesus is His Name."
157;I'VE ANCHORED IN JESUS;;"Upon life's boundless ocean
where mighty billows roll, 
I've fixed my hope in Jesus, 
blest anchor of my soul;
When trials fierce assail me 
as storms are gath’ring o’er, 
I rest upon His mercy
and trust Him more.

CHORUS
I've anchored in Jesus, 
the storms of life I'll brave, 
I’ve anchored In Jesus, 
I fear no wind or wave; 
I’ve anchored In Jesus, 
for He hath pow’r to save,
I’ve anchored in the Rock of Ages.

He keeps my soul from evil 
and gives me blessed peace; 
His voice has stilled the waters 
and bid their tumult cease. 
My pilot and deliv’rer 
to Him I all confide, 
For always when I need Him, 
He’s at my side.

He is my Friend and Savior, 
in Him my anchor’s cast, 
He drives away my sorrows 
and shields me from the blast; 
By faith I’m looking upward 
beyond life’s troubled sea, 
There I behold a haven 
prepared for me."
158;BEYOND THE SUNSET;;"Beyond the sunset, 
O blissful, morning, 
When with our Saviour 
heaven is begun, 
Earth’s toiling ended,
O glorious dawning
Beyond the sunset, 
when day is done.

Beyond the sunset 
no clouds will gather,
No storms will threaten, 
no fears annoy, 
Oh day of gladness, 
O day unending 
Beyond the sunset, 
Eternal joy.

Beyond the sunset, 
a hand will guide me
To God, the Father, 
whom I adore; 
His glorious presence, 
His words of welcome,
Will be my portion 
on that fair shore.


Beyond the sunset, 
O glad reunion, 
With our dear loves ones
Who’ve gone before. 
In that fair homeland 
we'll know know no parting 
Beyond the sunset forevermore."
159;A CHILD OF THE KING;;"My Father is rich in 
houses and lands, 
He holdeth the wealth 
of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, 
of silver and gold, 
His coffers are full, 
He has riches untold.

CHORUS
I'm a child of the King!
A child of the King!
With Jesus my Saviour,
I’m a child of the King!

My Father’s own Son, 
the Saviour of men, 
Once wandered o’er earth 
as the poorest of them; 
But now He is reigning 
forever on high, 
And will give me a home 
in heav’n by and by.

I once was an outcast, 
stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, 
an alien by birth!
But I’ve been adopted, 
my name’s written down, 
An heir to a mansion, 
a robe, and a crown

A tent or a cottage, 
why should I care?
They’re building a palace
for me over there!
Though exiled from home; 
yet still I may sing:
All glory to God, 
I’m a child of the King"
160;HOLD TO GOD'S UNCHANGING HANDS;;"Time is filled with swift transition,
Naught of earth unmoved can stand,
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God’s unchanging hand!

CHORUS
Hold to God's unchanging hand
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God’s unchanging hand!

Trust in Him who will not leave you,
Whatsoever years may bring,
If by earthly friends forsaken,
Still more closely to Him cling!

Covet not this world’s vain riches,
That so rapidly decay,
Seek to gain the heavenly treasure,
They will never pass away

When your journey is completed,
If to God you have been true,
Fair and bright the home in glory,
Your enraptured soul will view"
161;THE DAY OF REDEMPTION;;"Nations are breaking, 
Israel’s awakening, 
The signs that the prophets foretold;
The Gentile days numbered, 
with horrors encumbered; 
Eternity soon will unfold.

CHORUS
The day of redemption is near, 
Men’s hearts are failing for fear, 
Be filled with the Spirit, 
your lamps trimmed and clear, 
Look up!
Your redemption is near.

The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem’s restoring, 
Her national life, long dethroned; 
Today she is calling, 
her latter rain’s falling, 
Return, O dispersed, to your own.

Heaven’s powers are shaking, 
and many are mistaking 
God’s meaning to be of the sky; 
God’s Church is the power 
that’s shaking this hour:
The day of redemption is nigh.


False prophets are lying, 
God's Truth they’re denying
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generaton spurns
God’s revelation,
We’ll walk where the apostles 
have trod."
162;ONLY TRUST HIM;;"Come, every soul by sin oppressed, 
There’s mercy with the Lord, 
And He will surely give you rest, 
By trusting in His Word.

CHORUS
Only trust Him, only trust Him
Only trust Him now; 
He will save you, 
He will save you, 
He will save you now.

For Jesus shed His precious blood
Rich blessings to bestow:
Plunge now into the crimson flood
That washes white as snow.

Yes, Jesus is the truth, the Way,
That leads you into rest;
Believe in Him without delay,
And you are fully blest.

Come, then, and join 
this holy band,
And on to glory go,
To dwell in that celestial land,
Where joys immortal flow."
163;ONE DAY!;;"One day when heaven 
Was filled with His praises, 
One day when sin was as 
Black as could be,
Jesus came forth 
To be born of a virgin- 
Dwelt amongst men,
My example is He!

CHORUS
Living, He loved me; dying, 
He saved me;
Buried, He carried 
My sins far away; 
Rising, He Justified
Freely forever
One day He’s coming - 
Oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him up 
Calvary’s mountain,
One day they nailed Him 
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, 
Despised and rejected;
Bearing our sins, 
My Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him 
Alone in the garden, 
One day He rested,
From suffering free;
Angels came down o’er 
His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, 
My Saviour is He!

One day the grave could 
Conceal Him no longer;
One day the stone rolled 
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death 
He had conquered; 
Now is ascended, 
My Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet 
Will sound for His coming, 
One day the skies with His 
Glories will shine;
Wonderful day, my beloved ones bring
Glorious Saviour, this Jesus is mine!"
164;SWING LOW, SWEET CHARIOT;;"I looked over Jordan 
and what did I see,
Coming for to carry me home;
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

CHORUS
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do,
Coming for to carry me home;
Tell all my friends I'm a-coming too
Coming for to carry me home."
165;WHEN THEY RING THE BELLS;;"There's a land beyond the river, 
That we call the sweet forever, 
And we only reach that shore 
by faith’s decree;
One by one we’ll gain the portals, 
There to dwell with the immortals, 
When they ring the golden 
bells for you and me.

CHORUS
Don't you hear the bells now ringing
Don't you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee. 
In that far-off sweet forever, 
Just beyond the shining river, 
When they ring the golden bells
for you and me.

We shall know no sin or sorrow,
In the haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail 
beyond the silver sea 
We shall only know the blessing 
Of our Father’s sweet caressing, 
Whey they ring the golden bells 
for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
When in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands 
the spirit to be free;
Nevermore with anguish laden, 
We shall reach that lovely aden, 
When they ring the golden bells 
for you and me."
166;WHEN WE ALL GET TO HEAVEN;;"Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing his mercy and his grace;
In the mansions, bright and
blessed,
He’ll prepare for us a place.

CHORUS
When we all get to heaven, 
What a day of rejoicing 
that will be!
When we all see Jesus, 
We’ll sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim
pathway,
Clouds will overspread the sky;
But when travelling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving, every day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon his beauty we’ll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold."
167;THE OLD RUGGED CROSS;;"On a Hill far away 
stood an old rugged cross, 
The emblem of suff’ring and shame,
And I love that old cross 
where the Dearest and best, 
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

CHORUS
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, 
Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
And exchange it some day for a crown.

Oh, that old rugged cross, 
so despised by the world, 
Has a wondrous attraction for me; 
For the dear Lamb of God
left His glory above, 
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In the old rugged cross, 
stained with blood so divine, 
A wondrous beauty I see. 
For ‘twas on that old cross
 Jesus suffered and died, 
To pardon and sanctify me.

To the old rugged cross 
I will ever be true, 
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He’ll call me some day 
to my home far away, 
Where His glory forever I’ll share."
168;WHERE HE LEADS ME;;"I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
Take thy cross and follow, follow Me.

Chorus
Where He leads me I will follow, 
Where He leads me I will follow, 
Where He leads me I will follow, 
I’ll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I’ll go with Him through the garden, 
I’ll go with Him through the garden, 
I'll go with Him through the garden, 
I’ll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I’ll go with Him through the judgement,
I’ll go with Him through the judgement, 
I'll go with Him through the judgement, 
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
And go with me, with me all the
way."
169;WONDERFUL;;"Oh my heart sings today, 
sings for joy and gladness, 
Jesus saves, satisfies, 
banishes my sadness;
Guilt is gone, peace is mine, 
peace like to a river,
Jesus is wonderful, 
mighty to deliver.

CHORUS
Wonderful, wonderful, 
Jesus is to me, Counselor, 
Prince of Peace, Mighty God
 Is He; 
Saving me, keeping me from all 
sin and shame; 
Wonderful Is my Redeemer, 
praise His name.

Once a slave, now I'm free, 
free from condemnation,
Jesus gives liberty 
and a full salvation;
Now the sins of the past 
have been all forgiven, 
And my name is inscribed 
on the book of heaven.

Living here with my Lord 
in a holy union, 
Day by day, all the way, 
holding sweet communion; 
Oh what change grace hath 
wrought in my lowly station! 
Since my soul has received 
full and free salvation."
170;WHERE COULD I GO?;;"Living below in this old sinful world,
Hardly a comfort can afford;
Striving alone to face 
temptations sore,
Where could I go but to the Lord?

CHORUS
Where could I go,  where
could I go?
Seeking a refuge for my soul?
Needing a friend to help me
In the end,
Where could I go but to the
Lord?

Neighbours are kind, 
I love them every one, 
We get along in sweet accord; 
But when my soul 
needs manna from above, 
Where could I go but to the Lord?

Life here is grand 
with friends I love so dear,
Comfort I get from God’s own word;
Yet when I face
 the chilling hand of death,
Where could I go but to the Lord?"
171;WONDERFUL PEACE;;"Far away in the depth of my
spirit tonight
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm:
In celestial-like strains it unceasingly falls
O’er my soul like an infinite calm.

CHORUS
Peace! Peace! wonderful peace, 
Coming down from the Father above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, 
I pray, In fathomless billows of love.

What a treasure I have in this
wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul;
So secure that no power can mine
It away,
While the years of eternity roll.

I am resting tonight 
in this wonderful peace, 
Resting sweetly in Jesus’ control;
For I’m kept from all danger 
by night and by day, 
And His glory is flooding my soul.

And me thinks when I rise 
to that City of peace, 
Where the Author of peace I shall see, 
That one strain of the song which
 the ransomed will sing 
In that heavenly kingdom shall be 

Ah Soul, are you here without 
comfort and rest, 
Marching down the rough pathways of time?
Make Jesus your friend 
ere the shadows grow dark; 
Oh, accept this sweet peace so sublime."
172;THE SUN WILL NEVER;;"The sun, it will never go down, 
in that city, The sun,
 it will never go down; 
The flowers are blooming forever,
 And the sun, it will never go down.

I feel like travelling on, I do,
I feel like travelling on;
The flowers are blooming forever,
And the sun,
it will never go down.

I feel like shouting, sometimes I do,
I feel like shouting, I do;
The flowers are blooming forever, 
And the sun, it will never go down."
173;I BOWED AND CRIED, HOLY;;"I dreamed I went 
to that city called glory, 
So bright and so fair, 
When I entered the gate 
I cried, Holy,
The angels all met me there; 
They showed me from 
mansion to mansion’
And oh, the sights I saw, 
But I said, 
I want to see Jesus, 
The One who died for all,

CHORUS
Then I bowed on my knees 
and cried, Holy, Holy, Holy,
 I clapped my hands and sang,
 Glory, Glory to the Son of God.

I thought when I entered that city,
My friends knew me well,
They showed me all through
heaven,
The scenes are too numerous to
tell;
They showed me Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob,
Mark, Luke, and Timothy,
But I said, I want to give praise
To the One who died for me.

I thought when I saw my Saviour,
I just fell right down before Him,
Oh! Glory to God?
Singing, Praise to the name of the
Lord,
I bowed down and worshipped
Jehovah,
My friend of Calvary,
For I wanted to give praise to Jesus,
For saving a sinner like me."
174;WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN;;"I'm a pilgrim and a stranger
Wand'ring through this world of sin,
On my way to that fair city,
When the Saints go marching in.

CHORUS
When the saints go marching in,
When the saints go marching in,
Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching In.

Oh, I know l’ll see my Saviour
If my life is free from sin,
Heaven’s door will open for me,
When the Saints go marching in.

When we gather ‘round the Throne
And the gates are closed within,
I’ll be shouting Glory, Glory
When the Saints go marching in.

I’m waiting for the chariot
To swing low and I'll step in,
On the clouds I’ll ride to Heaven,
When the Saints go marching in."
175;I'D RATHER BE A CHRISTIAN;;"In this world I've tried
most everything,
And I’m happy now to say
There is nothing like religion
In the good old-fashioned way;
I am walking in the old-time way,
And I want the world to know
That I’d rather be an 
old-time christian
Than anything I know.

CHORUS
I'd rather be an 
old-time Christian
Than anything I know,
There’s nothing like an 
old-time Christian
With a Christian love to show;
I’m walking In the grand 
old  highway,
And am telling everywhere I go
That I’d rather be an 
old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

There are many things 
I’d like to be
As my journey I pursue,
I have longed to be a leader,
Like a mortal man would do;
I would like to be a millionaire,
With a million to bestow,
But I’d rather be an 
old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

All the world is bright since
I got right,
Now I sing and pray and shout,
All my burdens have been lifted
Since the Saviour brought me out;
I will tell the world both far 
 and near
As l travel here below,
That I’d rather be an
old-time Christian
Than anything I know."
176;BLESSED ASSURANCE;;"Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchased of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His Blood.

CHORUS
This is my story, this is my song.
Praising my Saviour all the day long
This is my story,this is my song, 
Praising my Saviour all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love."
177;THE CLOUD AND FIRE;;"As of old, when the hosts 
of Israel were compelled in 
the wilderness to dwell, 
Trusting they in their God 
to lead the way 
To the light of perfect day.

CHORUS
So the sign of the fire by night
And the sign of the cloud by day
Hovering o’er, just before,
As they journey on their way,
Shall a guide and a leader be,
Till the wilderness be past,
For the Lord, our God,
In His own good time
Shall lead to the light at last.

To and fro, as a ship without a 
sail 
Not a compass to guide them 
through the vale, 
But the sign of their  God was ever near, 
Thus their fainting hearts to cheer

All the days of their wand’rings 
they were fed, 
To the land of the promise 
they were led;
By the hand of the Lord in
guidance sure, 
They were brought to Canaan’s shore."
178;I WON'T HAVE TO CROSS JORDAN ALONE;;"When I come to the river 
at ending of day, 
When the last winds of sorrow 
have blown; 
There’ll be somebody waiting 
to show me the way,
I won’t have to cross Jordan alone.

CHORUS
I won't have to cross Jordan alone, 
Jesus died all my sins to atone; 
When the darkness I see, 
He'll be waiting for me, 
I won’t have to cross Jordan alone.

Oftentimes I’m forsaken, 
and weary and sad,
When it seems that my friends
have all gone;
There is one thought that cheers me 
and makes my heart glad, 
I won’t have to cross Jordan alone.

Though the billows of sorrow 
and trouble may sweep, 
Christ the Saviour will care for His own;
Till the end of my journey, 
my soul He will keep,
I won’t have to cross Jordan alone."
179;SOFTLY AND TENDERLY;Ab;"Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, 
Calling for you and for me, 
See on the portals 
He's waiting and watching,
Watching for you and for me.

CHORUS
Come home, come home, 
Ye who are weary, come home; 
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
calling O sinner, come home!

Why should we tarry 
when Jesus is pleading, 
Pleading for you and for me? 
Why should we linger 
and heed not His mercies,
 Mercies for you and for me?

Time is now fleeting, 
the moments are passing, 
Passing from you and from me; 
Shadows are gathering, 
death’s night is coming, 
Coming for you and for me.

Oh! For the wonderful love 
He has promised, 
Promised for you and for me;
 Though we have sinned, 
He has mercy and pardon, 
Pardon for you and for me."
180;CLOSE TO THEE;;"Thou, my everlasting portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Saviour, let me walk with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
All along my pilgrim journey
Saviour, let me walk with Thee.

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Nor for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me through the vale of
shadows,
Bear me o’er life’s fateful sea;
Then the gate of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Then the gate of life eternal
May l enter, Lord, with Thee."
181;GOT ANY RIVERS?;;"Be of good courage,
God spake unto Joshua, 
When o’er the river 
God pointed the way;
Jordan uncrossable! 
Things seemed impossible, 
Waters divide as 
they march and obey.

CHORUS
Got any rivers you think 
are uncrossable? 
Got any mountains you can’t 
tunnel through? 
God specializes In things 
thought impossible,
 And He will do what no 
other power can do.

Battles to win? 
They would meet with
 their obstacles, 
Jericho’s walls, 
too, must fall to the ground.
God never failed;
 He stood back of 
His promises, 
Walls had to crumble 
as they marched around.

God is the same and His 
word is dependable, 
He’ll make a way through 
the waters for you; 
Life’s situations by His 
are amendable, 
Mountains and hills 
He will part for you too."
182;NEVER GROW OLD;;"I have heard of a land 
on the far away strand, 
Tis a beautiful home of the soul;
Built by Jesus on high, 
there we never shall die, 
‘Tis a land where 
we’ll never grow old.

CHORUS
Never grow old, never grow old, 
In a land where we’ll never grow old, 
Never grow old never grow old, 
In a land where we’ll never grow old.

In that beautiful home 
where we’ll nevermore roam, 
We shall be in the sweet by and by; 
Happy praise to the King,
 through eternity sing, 
‘Tis a land where we never shalt die.

When our work here is done 
and the life-crown is won,
And our troubles and trials are o’er 
all our sorrow will end, 
and our voices will blend, 
With the loved ones 
who’ve gone on before."
183;LIFT HIM UP;;"How to reach the masses, 
men of every birth?
For an answer Jesus gave a key, 
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, 
Will draw all men unto me.

CHORUS
Lift Him up, lift Him up, 
Still He speaks from eternity, 
And I, If I be lifted up from the earth, 
Will draw all men unto me.

Oh the world is hungry 
for the living bread, 
Lift the Saviour up for 
them to see; 
Trust Him, and do not doubt 
the words that He said, 
I’ll draw all men unto me.

Don’t exalt the preacher, 
don’t exalt the pew, 
Preach the Gospel simple, 
full and free;
Prove Him and you will find 
that promise is true, 
I’ll draw all men unto me.

Lift Him up by living 
as a Christian ought, 
Let the world in you 
the Saviour see, 
Then men will gladly 
follow Him who once taught, 
I’ll draw all men unto me."
184;BEULAH LAND;;"I've reached the land 
of corn and wine,
 And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed 
one blissful day, 
For all my night 
has passed away.

CHORUS
Oh Beulah Land, 
sweet Beulah Land,
 As on Thy highest mount I stand, 
I look away across the sea, 
Where mansions are prepared for me, 
And view the shining glory-shore,
My Heaven, my home forevermorel

My Saviour comes 
and walks with me,
 And sweet communion 
here have we; 
He gently leads me 
by His hand, 
For this is Heaven’s borderland.

A sweet perfume 
upon the breeze
Is borne from ever 
vernal trees,
And flow’rs, 
that never fading grow,
Where streams of life 
forever flow.

The zephyrs seem 
to float to me,
Sweet sounds of Heaven’s 
melody,
As angels with the 
white-robed throng
Join in the sweet 
redemption song."
185;THE LORD BROUGHT;;"I'm so glad that the Lord 
brought me out;
I’m so glad that the Lord 
brought me out;
If it had not been for Jesus, 
oh where would I be?
I’m so glad that the Lord 
brought me out.

I've been happy since the Lord 
brought me out;
I’ve been happy since the Lord 
brought me out;
If it had not been for Jesus, 
oh where would I be?
Pvc been happy since the Lord 
brought me out.

Aren’t you glad that the Lord 
brought you out? 
Aren’t you glad that the Lord 
brought you out?
 If it had not been for Jesus, 
oh where would I be? 
I’m so glad that the Lord 
brought me out.

I’ve been singing since the Lord 
brought me out;
I’ve been singing since the Lord 
brought me out;
If it had not been for Jesus, 
oh where would I be?
I’m so glad that the Lord 
brought me out."
186;GATHERING SHEAVES;;"To the harvest field away we 
will gladly go today, 
Gathering sheaves, 
beautiful sheaves;
From the early dawn till night 
we will labor with our might, 

CHORUS
Gathering sheaves, 
beautiful sheaves.
Gathering sheaves, 
beautiful sheaves, 
Gathering sheaves, 
beautiful sheaves;
Praise the Lord, we’re on our way to
That land of endless day, 
Gathering sheaves, 
beautiful sheaves.

On the mountain, 
hill or plain we will harvest in the grain, 
Gathering sheaves, 
beautiful sheaves;
Yes, we’ll labour far and near, never
falter, never fear, Gathering sheaves, 
beautiful sheaves.

We will sing and we will pray, 
and our Master’s voice obey, 
Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves;
As we go in foreign lands, 
doing what our Lord commands, 
Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves."
187;SUCH LOVE;;"That God should love 
a sinner such as I, 
Should yearn to change 
my sorrow into bliss, 
Nor rest till He had planned 
to bring me nigh, 
How wonderful is love like this!

CHORUS
Such love, such wondrous love,
Such love, such wondrous love,
That God should love a sinner
such as I,
How wonderful Is love like this!

That Christ should join 
so freely in the scheme,
Although it meant 
His death on Calvary, 
Did ever human tongue 
find nobler theme
Than love divine 
that ransomed me?

That for a wilful outcast 
such as I, 
The Father planned, 
The Saviour bled and died;
Redemption for a worthless 
slave to buy, 
Who long had law and grace 
defied.

And now He takes me 
to His heart, a son, 
He asks me not 
to fill a servant’s place;
The far-off country 
wand’rings all are done, 
Wide open are His arms 
of grace."
188;DOWN FROM HIS GLORY;;"Down from His glory, 
ever living story, 
My God and Saviour came, 
and Jesus was His name. 
Born in a manger, 
to His own a stranger,
 A Man of sorrows, 
tears and agony.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Him! 
How I adore Him! 
My breath, my sunshine, 
my all in all! 
The great Creator 
became my Saviour, 
And all God’s fullness 
dwelleth in Him.

What condescension, 
bringing us redemption, 
That in the dead of night, 
not one faint hope in sight; 
God, gracious, tender, 
laid aside His splendour, 
Stooping to woo, to win,
 to save my soul.

Without reluctance, 
flesh and blood His substance, 
He took the form of man, 
revealed the hidden plan.
Oh glorious mystery, 
Sacrifice of Calvary, 
And now I know Thou 
art the great I AM"
688;DO SOMETHING NEW IN MY HEART;;"Do something new in my heart

737;I WANT THAT KIND OF BLESSING;;"When Jacob met the Lord
Upon that lonely night
He wrestled there alone
Until the morning light
He won a princely title
To guard him for the night
I want that kind of blessing.

Chorus
I want yes I want that kind of blessing
That saves and keeps, and satisfies
the soul,
I want yes I want, that full salvation 
till the billows, 
of Heaven o'er me roll.

When Israel at last
Came to the promised land
The Lord His blessings gave
So full on every hand
He fought their enemies from them
They dwelt a happy band
I want that kind of blessing.

This is the day of grace
The Comforter has come
We are The Chosen Bride
The Lord is drawing nigh
He's waiting to be gracious
The prayer of faith to hear
And then He'll send the blessing."
941;WHY DID I WALK THRU THE VALLEY;;"Why did I walk thru the valley
Why was I forced to my knees
Why did the sun parch and dry me
When I walked thru the desert of defeat
Then came the clouds and the rain fell
I thought I'd never make it thru the night
God gave me the answer when I prayed in tears
He let me see the dark, before the light.

Chorus
I can kneel with a brother
Who is bearing a burden
And say I know just what you're going thru
I can pray with a sister, in the midst of her sorrow
And say I know because I've been there too
I can put my arms around, someone who is down
Tell them to have faith and confidence
What in pain I could not see
I now fully believe
God prepared me for such a time, as this.

You'll know without a doubt and you can say."

He’s a Friend who always cares and understands.
Standing somewhere in the shadows You’ll find Him,

As the darkness of night settles round you?
As your hope and your faith waver through?"

 Hide Thou, me.

Sometimes it seems I dare not 
go one step farther on,
And from my heart all courage 
has slipped away and gone;
But, I remember Jesus, 
and all His love for me, 
Then I cry, O Rock of Ages, 
Hide Thou me.

O what a Friend is Jesus, 
sure Anchor of my soul,
So tender, true and gracious,
 I'm safe in His control,
My help in time of danger, 
my strong defense is He, 
O Thou blessed Rock of Ages,
 Hide Thou me."
952;LIFE IS LIKE A MOUNTAIN RAILROAD;;"Life is like a mountain railroad, 
with an engineer that's brave;
We must make the run successful, 
from the cradle to the grave;
Watch the curves, the fills, the tunnels; 
never falter, never fail;
Keep your hands upon the throttle, 
and your eyes upon the rail.

Chorus
Bless'd Savior, Thou wilt guide us,
Till we reach that blissful shore;
Where the angels wait to join us
In Thy praise forevermore.

You will roll up grades of trial; 
you will cross the bridge of strife;
See that Christ is your Conductor 
on this lightning train of life;
Always mindful of obstruction, 
do your duty, never fail;
Keep your hands upon the throttle, 
and your eyes upon the rail.

You will often find obstructions; 
look for storms of wind and rain;
On a fill, or curve, or trestle, 
they will almost ditch your train;
Put your trust alone in Jesus; 
never falter, never fail;
Keep your hands upon the throttle, 
and your eyes upon the rail.

As you roll across the trestle, 
spanning Jordan's swelling tide,
You behold the Union Depot 
into which your train will glide;
There you'll meet the Superintendent, 
God the Father, God the Son,
With the hearty, joyous, plaudit, 
""Weary pilgrim, welcome home!"""
953;WHAT WAS HIS PURPOSE FOR YOU?;;"The Lord is coming just for you,
Why can't you be ready,
The life you spend He offers you free,
Then have you thought of the cost.

Chorus
What was His purpose for you on earth?
Why did He die for you (and me)?
The moments are passing but stop to think,
What have you done with God.

Your life is meant for His life alone,
Why give yourself to the world?
He sighed He paid by bearing your sins,
Just serve Him alone.

Just give me courage in hardest times,
Determination for challenging tasks,
Sufficient grace is what I need, 
To overcome always.

Don't harden your soul in sins deceit,
Provocation should not be your guide,
For Christ the Lord went toiling on earth,
And was the image of God."
954;STILL BLESSED;;"Sometimes I wake up in the morning
I see I made it through the night
I listen for my family sure enough they're alright
As we gather round the table
Bow our heads in thankfulness
With tear filled eyes my heart cries still blessed
 

Chorus
There's never a day He doesn't give me all I need
Even when I wake up to the storm
My soul cries peace
Sometimes I try to count them
They're too many I confess 
So with arms upraised I just say still blessed
 

Now I don't want to leave my family
I don't want to leave my friends
Oh but lately I've been homesick
How I long just to be with Him
So in the morning should you find me
With my eyes closed in death 
Oh what victory, what glory, still blessed
 

Sometimes I try to count them
They're too many I confess 
So with arms upraised I just say still blessed"
955;AVENUE OF PRAYER;;"My dear friend this sinful world is lost and dying,
Every Christian’s heart is burdened down with care,
Tell me are you doing all you can for Jesus,
Are you traveling down the Avenue of Prayer.

CHORUS
Keeping faith in your heart and consecrate it,
Every hour of every day do you prepare?
Are you ready should your Master call at midnight,
Are you traveling down the Avenue of Prayer.

Are you praying for the ones who know not Jesus,
As they are being there into the tempter’s snare,
Could you stand aside and see a losing battle,
Are you traveling down the Avenue of Prayer."
956;WASTED YEARS;;"Have you wandered along on 
life’s pathway? 
Have you lived without love a life of fear?        
Have you searched for that great
 hidden meaning?
Or is your life filled with long wasted years.

chorus
Wasted years wasted years oh how foolish        
As you walk on in darkness and fear                
Turn around, Turn around God is calling,
He’s calling you from a life of wasted years.

Search for wisdom and understanding,        
There’s someone who knows and always hears.
Come to Him! Come to Him! Your sins confessing,
You can’t go on with a life of wasted years.

Don’t you know Jesus died for all the sinners?
He loves you and all your guilt He gladly bears
Give it up; give it up the load you’re carrying
You can’t go on with a life of wasted years."
957;THERE'S DUST ON THE ALTAR;;"Children are scattered all over 
the land
We’ve lost our love for our fellow man
Fathers and mothers are parted today
There’s dust on the altar where we 
used to pray

Chorus
Let's seek out the old paths and 
walk therein
Our children are crying and dying in sin
Satan is laughing as God’s people stray
There’s dust on the altar where 
we used to pray

Tears that were once shed for a 
brother in need
Are now called old fashioned, they’re no
longer seen
Greed and proud hearts have gotten
in the way
There’s dust on the altar where 
we used to pray"
958;I WANT TO DO THY WILL OH LORD.;;"The cross that you bear,
May be hard to carry,
And every pain you feel so hard
To understand,
But every pain that you feel, 
He died just to heal,
I want to do Thy Will, Oh Lord.

Chorus
I want to do Thy Wil, Oh Lord,
I want to do Thy Will, Oh Lord,
Take me and  break me,
Mold me and make me,
I want to do Thy Will, Oh Lord.

He paid the price, 
The sacrifice with His  Blood at Calvary,
He stood alone in Pilate's judgment hall,
He took the Cross,  paid the cost, 
For my soul that was lost,
I want to do Thy Will, Oh Lord."
959;CAMEL TRAIN;;"Oh get ready evening shadows 
fall
Can't you hear the Eliezer calling
We have come into this wedding and 
our joy is now in Him
In the evening when the camel 
trains come in.

It was a day in the early spring time
By an ancient  wayside well
Eleazer paused to rest his camel train
He found  a bride for Isaac as the 
evening shadows fell
For his weary journey had not been 
in vain

So he took a fair Rebecca like 
we do it now and then
To Abraham and Isaac far away 
Now Rebecca loved her Isaac and 
he loved Rebecca too
Oh it must have been a happy wedding 
day 

Now the blessed Holy Spirit from our 
Father God above
Has come down to earth to find a 
worldly Bride
And our Isaac over yonder has prepared 
the tents of love
And He wants His fair Rebecca 
by His side

Now we left our kinfold gladly and we 
bade this world goodbye
We are going to a Home beyond the sky
Where we'll soon behold our Isaac in that 
blessed eternity
Oh what a happy happy wedding that 
will be

All things ready now the evening  
shadows fell
Can't you hear the Eleazer calling
We have come into this wedding and 
our joy is now in Him
And the Bridegroom bids His  lovely
Bride come in

Oh get ready evening shadows fall
Can't you hear the Eleazar calling
We have come into this wedding and 
our joy is now in Him
And the Bridegroom bids His  lovely Bride
come in"
960;WHAT A DAY!;;"One day I'll be walking along, 
Maybe down a country road 
Or going to a friend's house over town 
And suddenly there will appear, 
a loved one standing near,
A loved one who has gone on before.

Chorous  
And when you see them you'll know,
that it's not long
Till you'll be changed just like they are,
To a body pure and free, immortality,
What a day, what a day that's gonna be.

Someday rainbows will sweep the sky;
there'll be a trumpet sound,
The dead in Christ will be coming up
Oh how we'll warn him then,
we better warn him now
For after awhile it will be too late."
961;HOW MARVELOUS HOW WONDERFUL;;"I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.

chorus
How marvelous! How wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! How wonderful!
Is my Savior's love for me!

For me it was in the garden
He prayed: ""Not my will, but Thine.""
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat-drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To strengthen Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered, and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face at last I shall see,
'Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me."
962;God is good;;"chorus
God is good all the time
He put a song of praise
 in the heart of mine
God is good all the time
Through the darkest night, 
His light will shine
God is good, God is good all the time

If you're walking through the valleys
And there are shadows all around
Do not fear, He will guide you
He will keep you safe and sound
He has promised to never leave you
Nor forsake you, and His word is true

We are sinners and so unworthy
Still for us He chose to die
Filled us with His Holy Spirit
Now we can stand and testify
That His love is everlasting
And His mercies, they will never end

Though I may not understand
All the plans you have for me
My life is in your hands
And through the eyes of faith
I can clearly see that"

I'll speed up, and they'll slow down
There is a land

So I'll dry these weeping eyes 
and I'll lift my head to the sky..."

Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches as the highest star 
and covers the world
Its power is eternal its 
glory is supper all

Could ever leave, 
redeeming souls to live again

I'd be enslaved
Without him my life would be hopeless
But with Jesus thank God I'm saved"

There's a crown and you can win it
If you go in Jesus name

In the mad rush of the broad way
In the hurry and the strife
Tell of Jesus love and mercy
Give to them the word of life

Does the place you're called to labor
Seem too small and the strife
Tell of Jesus love and mercy
Give to them the word of life

Are you laid aside from service
Boldly worn from toil and care?

Welcome home, my child- well done"

At my feet in ashes lay.

Of my heart was set aflame;

But it's brightness shall only come
to them that love the Lord, 
Are you ready for that day to come?

There’s a sad day coming, 
a sad day coming, 
There’s a sad day coming by and by, 
When the sinner shall hear his doom, 
Depart, I know ye not,
 Are you ready for that day to come."
198;HE’S COMING SOON;;"In these, the closing 
days of time, 
What joy the glorious 
hope affords, 
That soon - oh, wondrous truth 
sublime!
He shall reign, King of kings 
and the Lord of lords.

CHORUS
He's coming soon, 
He's coming soon; 
With joy we welcome His 
returning;
It may be morn, it may be night 
or noon, 
We know He’s coming soon.

The signs around, 
in the earth and air, 
Or painted on the starlit sky, 
God’s faithful 
witnesses declare 
That the coming of the Saviour 
draweth nigh.

The dead in Christ
who ‘neath us lie,
In countless numbers, 
all shall rise
When through the portals 
of the sky
He shall come to 
prepare our Paradise.

And we who, living, 
yet remain,
Caught up, shall meet 
our faithful Lord;
This hope we cherish
not in vain,
But we comfort one another 
by this word."
199;WHAT A FRIEND;;"What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
Oh what peace we often forfeit,
Oh what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He’ll take and shield
thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there."
200;I'M BOUND FOR THE PROMISED LAND;;"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, 
And cast a wishful eye,
Toward Canaan’s fair and happy land, 
Where my possessions lie.

CHORUS
I'm bound for the promised land, 
I'm bound for the promised land; 
Oh who will come and go with me?
I'm bound for the promised land.

O’er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns,
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds, nor pois’nous breath, 
Can reach that healthful shore; 
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death.
Are feared and felt no more.

When shall I reach that happy place,
And be forever blest!
When shall I see my Father’s face,
And in His bosom rest?"
201;THE GREAT PHYSICIAN;;"The great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus,
He speaks the drooping heart to
cheer,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;

CHORUS
Sweetest note in seraph song
Sweetest name on mortal
tongue,
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus blessed Jesus.

Your many sins are all forgiven,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to
heaven,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Saviour’s name,
I love the name of Jesus.

His name dispels my guilt and
fear,
No other name but Jesus;
Oh how my soul delights to hear
The charming name of Jesus."
202;I MUST TELL JESUS;;"I must tell Jesus all of my trials; 
I cannot bear these burdens alone;
In my distress He kindly will help me;
He ever loves and cares for His own.

CHORUS
I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus
I cannot bear my burden alone;
I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus
Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.

I must tell Jesus all of my troubles;
He is a kind, compassionate Friend;
If I but ask Him, He will deliver,
Make of my troubles quickly an end.

Tempted and tried 
I need a great Saviour, 
One who can help my burdens to bear;
I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus; 
He all my cares and sorrows will share.

Oh how the world to evil allures me
Oh how my heart is tempted to sin!
I must tell Jesus, and He will help me
Over the world the vict’ry to win."
203;NOTHING BETWEEN;;"Nothing between my soul and the Saviour,
Naught of this world’s delusive dream:
I have renounced all sinful pleasure, 
Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.

CHORUS
Nothing between my soul and the Saviour
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favor, 
Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.

Nothing between like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem, 
Must not my heart from Him ever sever;
He is my all, there’s nothing between.

Nothing between, like pride or station, 
Self or friends shall not intervene; 
Though it may cost me much tribulation, 
I am resolved, there’s nothing between.

Nothing between, even many hard trials,
Though the whole world against me 
convene; 
Watching with prayer and much self-denial, 
I’ll triumph at last, with nothing between."
204;WHAT A DAY THAT WILL BE;;"There is coming a day when 
no heartaches shall come, 
No more clouds in the sky, 
no more tears to dim the eyes;
All is peace forevermore on
that happy golden shore, 
What a day, glorious day that will be.

CHORUS
What a day’ that will be 
when my Jesus I shall see, 
And I look upon His face, 
the One who saved by His grace, 
When He takes me by the hand, 
and leads me through the Promised Land,
 What a day, glorious day that will be.

There’ll be no sorrow there, 
no more burdens to bear, 
No more sickness, no pain, 
no more parting over there; 
And forever I will be with 
the One who died for me, 
What a day, glorious day that will be"
205;NEAR THE CROSS;;"Jesus keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain,
Free to all, a healing stream,
Flows from Calv’rys mountain.

CHORUS
In the cross, In the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadows o’er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting, ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."
206;PASS ME NOT;;"Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by.

CHORUS
Saviour, Saviour, 
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by.

Let me at Thy throne of mercy,
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me,
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?"
207;I SEE A CRIMSON STREAM;;"On Calvary's hill of sorrow
Where sin’s demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid.

CHORUS
I see a crimson stream of blood, 
It flows from Calvary, 
Its waves which reach 
the throne of God, 
Are sweeping over me.

Today no condemnation,
Abides to turn away
My soul from His salvation,
He’s In my heart to stay.

When gloom and sadness whisper
You’ve sinned, no use to pray;
I look away to Jesus,
And He tells me to say.

And when we reach the portal
Where life forever reigns,
The ransomed hosts grand final
Will be this glad refrain."

Come, whosoever will;
Praise God for full salvation
For whosoever will.

‘All things are ready,
come to the feast!
Come, for the door is open wide; 
A place of honor is reserved 
For you at the Master’s side.

‘All things are ready, come to the feast!
Come, while He waits to welcome thee;
Delay not while this day is thine, 
Tomorrow may never be.

‘All things are ready, come to the feast!
Leave every care and worldly strife; 
Come, feast upon the love of God,
And drink everlasting life."
209;LORD, I'M COMING HOME;;"I've wandered far away from God,
Now I’m coming home;
The paths of sin too long I’ve trod,
Lord, I’m coming home.

CHORUS
Coming home, coming home,
Never more to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love,
Lord, I’m coming home.

I’ve wasted many precious years,
Now I’m coming home;
I now repent with bitter tears,
Lord, I’m coming home.

I’m tired of sin and straying Lord,
Now I’m coming home;
I’ll trust Thy love, 
believe Thy Word,
Lord, I’m coming home,

My soul is sick, my heart is sore,
Now I’m coming home;
My strength renew, my hope
restore,
Lord, I’m coming home.

My only hope, my only plea,
Now I’m coming home;
That Jesus died, and died for me,
Lord, I’m coming home.

I need His cleansing blood, I know,
Now I’m coming home;
Oh wash me whiter than the snow,
Lord, I’m coming home."
210;THE EASTERN GATE;;"I will meet you in the morning,
Just inside the Eastern Gate,
Then be ready, faithful pilgrim,
Lest with you it be too late.

CHORUS
I will meet you, I will meet you
Just Inside the Eastern Gate
over there;
I will meet you, I will meet you,
I will meet you In the morning
over there.

If you hasten off to glory,
Iinger near the eastern Gate,
For I’m coming in the morning,
So you’ll not have long to wait.

Keep your lamps all trimmed and
burning,
For the bridegroom watch and wait,
He’ll be with us at the meeting,
Just inside the Eastern Gate.

Oh the joys of that glad meeting
With the saints who for us wait,
What a blessed, happy meeting,
Just inside the Eastern Gate"
211;JESUS PAID IT ALL;;"I hear the Saviour say, 
Thy strength indeed is small, 
Child of weakness, 
watch and pray, 
Find in Me thine all in all.


CHORUS
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain:
He washed it white as snow


Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow’r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper’s spots,
And melt the heart of stone.


Since nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim,
I’ll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvry’s Lamb."
212;I BELIEVE GOD;;"I believe God! I believe God!
It shall be done, even as He said;
Trust and obey, look up and say,
I believe, I believe God.

And if you want salvation now
And the Holy Ghost and power,
Just trust and obey, 
Believe Him and say:
I believe, I believe God."
213;WE'LL WORK TILL JESUS COMES;;"Oh land of rest, for thee I sigh!
When will the moment come
When I shall lay my armour by,
And dwell in peace at home?

CHORUS
We'll work till Jesus comes,
We'll work till Jesus comes,
We'll work till Jesus comes,
And we'll be gathered home

To Jesus Christ I fled for rest;
He bade me cease to roam;
And lean for succor on His breast
Till He conduct me home

I sought at once my Saviour’s side, 
No more my steps shall roam; 
With Him I’ll brave death’s chilling tide 
And reach my heavenly home."
214;THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN;;"The windows of Heaven are open,
The blessings are falling today,
There’s joy, joy, joy in my heart,
For Jesus makes everything right;
I gave Him my old tattered garment,
He gave me a robe of pure white,
I’m feasting today on the Manna,
And that’s why I’m happy today."
215;PRECIOUS MEMORIES;;"Precious memories, unseen angels,
Sent from somewhere to my soul;
How they linger, ever near me,
And the sacred past unfold.

CHORUS
Precious memories, how they linger, 
How they ever flood my soul; 
In the stillness of the midnight, 
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.

Precious father, loving mother,
Fly across the lonely years;
And old home scenes of my
Childhood,
In fond memory appear.

In the stillness of the midnight,
Echoes from the past I hear;
Old-time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere.

As I travel on life’s pathway,
I Know not what the years may hold;
As I ponder, hope grows fonder,
Precious memories flood my soul."
216;THE END TIME;;"I look and see earth’s 
sorrowing picture, 
The hoarding mobs for selfish gain; 
Their toil of life for ease and comfort, 
Can they not see, their doom is sealed,
it’s all in vain.

CHORUS
The end is here,
It’s now at hand, 
The Bride Is gathering
the world Is failing 
Israel’s awak'ening; 
Nations are breaking 
Our prophet taught us, 
we believe the end is here.

Sirs, this is the time! 
Our prophet spoke of, 
The Angel came with a shout, 
The mountain shook 
as His Voice cried out, 
Time is no more loud and clear
the Shout went forth.

Have you considered the end-time
Message?
Have you considered Malachi 4?
Revelation 10:7 and St. Luke 17
Proclaims this Message now, and
then forevermore."
219;SO JUST BE FAITHFUL;;"In these days of trials so near the end, 
When Christ from Glory doth now descend, 
Men’s hearts are failing and filled with fear, 
We know the end time is surely here.

CHORUS
So Just be faithful,
believe His Word; 
stay with the Message 
that you have heard; 
List’n to His prophet, 
his message heed; 
Walk in the Light where
His star doth lead.

In every church age a star did shine, 
To help God’s people a Truth to find;
In this last church age a star shines bright, 
So friend receive It, walk in the Light.

Do not be fearful or filled with dread, 
Your prophet sleepeth, he is not dead;
The Bride is waiting now for that Voice,
 And in this hope we can now rejoice.

His Word of promise he gave the bride, 
From his White Charger the prophet cried, 
Yet one more time shall I ride this trail.
Thus Saith The Lord can never fail."
220;BLEST BE THE TIE THAT BINDS;;"Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father’s throne,
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes,
our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again."
221;GOD BE WITH YOU;;"God be with you till we meet again!
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you till we meet again!

CHORUS
Till we meet! Till we meet!
Till we meet at Jesus’ feet;
Till we meet! Till we meet!
God be with you till we meet
again!

God be with you till we meet again! 
‘Neath His wings securely hide you, 
Daily manna still provide you; 
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!
When life’s perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you;
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again! 
Keep love’s banner floating o’er you, 
Smite death’s threat’ning wave before you; 
God be with you till we meet again!"
222;TAKE THE NAME OF JESUS;;"Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it, where’er you go.

CHORUS
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of Heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.

Take the name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

Oh the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ!

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in Heaven we'll
crown Him,
When our journey is complete."
223;I'M USING MY BIBLE FOR A ROAD MAP;;"I'm using my Bible for a road map, 
Ten commandments they tell me what to do, 
The twelve disciples are my road signs; 
And Jesus will see me safely through.

CHORUS
There'll be no detours in heaven,
No rough roads along the way, 
I’m using my Bible for a road map, 
My last stop is heaven some sweet day.

I’m using my Bible for a road map,
The children of Israel used it too
They crossed the Red sea of destruction,
For God was there to see them through."
224;WHEN STEPHEN WAS ACCUSED;;"When Stephen was accused, 
lonely and bewildered, 
No-one that day, 
would stand by his aid,
He looked in the heavens 
and saw the face of Jesus 
And He rolled him over the tide.

CHORUS
I’ve never had a prayer, 
He couldn’t answer
 I’ve never shed a tear, 
He could not dry
 And when the waves of life. 
are so hard you can’t mount them
He will roll you over the tide.

When the world is chasing me, 
and my life becomes a burden 
I want to run, but there’s
no place to hide, 
I’ll just look up like old Stephen 
to the right hand of the Father
 And He will roll me over the tide."
225;I’LL STAND FOR JESUS;;"In this world filled with pleasures,
We’re tempted and tried,
The more that we have, here on
this earth,
The less we’re satisfied;
The only thing that’s lasting,
Comes from above,
I'll stand for Jesus and let the
World go by.

CHORUS
I'll stand for Jesus and 
let the world go by, 
I'll claim His promise, 
He will supply, 
We’ll walk together, 
My Lord and I, 
I’ll stand for Jesus 
and let the world go by.

When it’s time to depart,
From this sore body of mine,
I don’t want to own one thing that
I can’t leave behind
I want to be free, to sail through
the skies;
That’s why l want to be with Jesus,
And let the world go by."
226;EVERYBODY UP THERE;;"I wondered again 
of my home in heaven, 
Where we shall have peace 
and be happy and free, 
Where Jesus shall rule and 
the saints be with Him,
Where we all will be young 
and we'll never grow old.

CHORUS
Everybody up there, 
Will give praise to the Master 
Nobody up there that will disagree
We all will be one, big family in heaven
And we will all have a name
By the Father above.

I want to thank God 
for the seventh angel
The vessel God chose 
to bring forth His word
Now the prophet has gone and the 
days here are numbered 
When Jesus will come 
to take home His bride."
227;MAY MY LIFE BE A STEPPING STONE;;"The other day I bowed 
my head and cried in shame;
I asked the Lord if there’s someone
that I could show the way
When I think of all the loved ones 
who live their lives in vain, 
I pray Dear Lord may I not be
the one that is to blame.

CHORUS
May my life down here 
be a stepping stone for them, 
May they not see me 
but Christ living in me
Help me spend more time 
on my knees and prayer for them, 
Before you close the door 
like you did in Noah’s time.

It’s getting late soon time 
will be no more
Help me walk in the light 
of the prophet of Malachi 4 
Not to rely on others but do 
what the Word says to do 
Till you call for me, 
let me live my life for you."
228;LORD IS THERE ROOM FOR ME?;;"I wandered so far 
from my Father’s home,
And in my world of sin sometimes 
felt so alone, 
It seems I heard a voice within
saying to me:
The Father will welcome you 
back to the family.

CHORUS
Lord is there room 
in your mansion for me?
I know I was wrong, 
but now I’m so sorry, 
I want to come home, 
I want to come home; 
Lord Is there room In your
 mansion for me?

All those wasted years, 
can I ever repay? 
Can I make them up,
Oh Lord some way?
Then I heard Him say, 
as in the story of old:
Welcome my child, 
back to the Father’s fold!"
229;GOD RICH IN MERCY;;"This world was lost and so undone,
Just look at what sin has done, 
Believing the lie that 
Satan told to Eve that day,
Throwing this world in total despair, 
In east of Eden no longer could dwell 
Now they can see driven 
from God what sin has done.

CHORUS
God rich in mercy, God rich in mercy, 
Sent us His Son, we were undone, 
God rich In mercy; God rich In grace, 
God rich in love, 
Sent us the best from heaven above,
Saying to all of men today, 
God rich In mercy, God rich in mercy.

A prophet God sent to restore His word
As its recorded in Malachi 4 
Behold I’ll send you Elijah before that day
What’s been destroyed I will restore, 
Proving to men God keeps His word, 
Now they can see what I’ve revealed, 
I’m rich in mercy."
230;SING ME A SONG ABOUT CALVARY;;"CHORUS
Sing me a song about Calvary,
Show me Its suffering in love 
Tell it till each part of my soul sublimes
Thank God for the old rugged Cross.

There's an empty tomb in Jerusalem today, 
That plainly to us testifies, 
That He who slept there no longer is dead
But liveth and reigneth on high.
 And just as sure as He came below 
To suffer and die for my sins; 
Just as sure what I feel in my heart;
Makes me know He’s soon coming again.

They say soon each mountain 
and each lofty place, 
Will be brought down by God’s will 
Yet in my heart for ever will stand, 
The vision of Golgotha hill. 
Cos that’s where Jesus my 
Saviour and Lord
Gladly the sacrifice made 
So when I repented and 
came to His Throne
There I found sins debt 
already was paid."
231;IT'LL BE WORTH EVERY MILE OF THE TRIP;;"Well I've been on the mountain, 
and I've walked through the 
valleys, 
And when troubles come up 
Had my share;
But heavens eternal, 
at the end of my journey
Will be worth every mile of the trip.

CHORUS
Like a happy pilgrim 
who's arrived on the shore 
And forgot how the waves 
tossed his ship, 
If I could see Jesus smile, 
hear Him say well done child 
It'll be worth every mile of the trip.

Well I stood at the bedside 
of a Christiain departing, 
And I heard these last words 
from his lips:
I see the crystal streams aflowing, 
And hear the gentle breeze blowing 
And its worth every mile of the trip."
232;GATHER IN CHRIST THE KING;;"Shall we gather in Tucson, 
or in Jeffersonville?
That was the question 
that was asked one day
We just want to be,
where we will be caught away.

CHORUS
The prophet answered the question, 
He said It’s been revealed to me, 
I will tell you where to gather 
Just gather In Christ the King.

Up in Sabino Canyon the Messenger 
was in prayer
The Sword of the King fell in his hand
It was the Word of God from the Son of Man.

Now that we know where to gather, 
Now that we know where to stay, 
Let’s strive each day to abide in Him, 
So when the time comes we will be there."
233;CORONATION DAY;;"I may not have fortune, 
I may not have fame
But when He opens His Book, 
He will find my name, 
And perhaps my neighbour, 
will meet me there, 
But they can’t crown my Jesus,
until I get there.

Chorus
On the coronation day, 
in that land far away
The marriage supper with the angels 
we will share 
But there’s one 
thing am sure 
That I know they can’t do, 
They can’t crown my Saviour 
until I get there.

You may be very rich, 
or you may be poor
You may have to eat 
at the rich man’s door
But remember some day, 
heavens glory we’ll share
But they can’t crown Jesus, 
until I get there."
234;THERE'S NO MOUNTAIN I CAN'T CLIMB;;"I have been on the mountain 
and in the valley so low 
When it seemed I’d never had 
a place to go, 
Then I found Jesus,
 now He is mine;
And there’s no mountain 
I can’t climb.

CHORUS
There is no mountain that 
we can’t climb
When I say 'we' I mean Jesus 
and me
If you got Jesus and He is thine, 
There is no mountain 
that you can’t climb.

I was in despair and troubles
 beset me, 
Tears filled my eyes and 
I could not see; 
Till I trusted Jesus and
 His love divine, 
Now there's no mountain 
that I can’t climb."
235;DON'T WEEP FOR ME;;"I can see the sun going down
My time down here will soon be o’er
I will hear the angels sing
When I reach the golden shore.

CHORUS
Don't weep, for me
When they take me to my
resting place
I’ll shout and sing
When I see my Saviour’s face.

Soon the stones will be rolled away,
 And the graves will open wide
 We’ll take our flight on angels’ wings
 And there with Jesus we’ll abide.

Don’t you weep when am crossing Jordan
For you won’t have too long to wait
You’ll be coming on some bright morning
And I’ll meet you at the Eastern gate."
236;BEYOND THE SWELLING FLOOD;;"In robes made white through
 Jesus blood
We soon shall meet 
beyond the flood,
And hold sweet converse 
free from pain
And never fear to part again, 

CHORUS
Beyond the swelling flood.
Beyond the swelling flood
Beyond the swelling flood
Beyond the swelling flood
We’ll meet to part no more
We’ll meet to part no more
We’ll meet to pait no more
We’ll meet to part no more
Beyond the swelling flood

In fear not now that ills may 
come
By faith I see that heavenly 
home
And hear the angels voices say
‘Thy God shall wipe all tears away.
Beyond the swelling flood.

Oh meeting blest with 
friends so dear
What sound shall greet the 
listening ear 
What shouts of rapture wake 
the soul
As back those golden gates 
shall roll, Beyond the swelling flood.

Dear Saviour guide my willing feet,
That I may have that joy complete
That I may praise through endless
day
The love that dries all tears away,
Beyond the swelling flood."
237;IT IS EXPEDIENT FOR ME TO GO;;"Jesus said, it is expedient 
for me to go away
Then all send you another 
comforter to guide you from 
day to day 
So they tarried in Jerusalem 
for power would come from 
high 
That same spirit that they 
received will in my heart abide.


CHORUS
I can feel the Holy Spirit 
Oh dwelling deep within 
Well sometimes it feels so gentle
And sometimes like a mighty 
rushing wind, 
But that same Spirit that raised Jesus 
up from the dead and 
from the grave, 
It shall raise, this sore body up 
and take me home some day.

Oh they laid Him in an empty tomb
And they rolled the old 
stone at the door;
They put soldiers, there to guard Him, 
you know they thought they’d run 
away with the Lord, 
But on the third day, 
the stone was rolled away
And He came forth from the grave 
That same Spirit that raised Jesus 
up will take me home some day."
239;JESUS MADE ME WHOLE;;"I used to think money and
Pleasures,
Were all that life had to offer to me
My life was so filled with joys of
this world
How blind, oh how blind could I be.

CHORUS
Jesus made me whole, 
yes His love is as pure as 
gold His mercies are treasures untold;
Until you’ve known Jesus then 
you will never see, 
What true joy of living can be.

I fell on my knees and I could 
not explain
What took place with me there 
and then, 
But things that had once seemed 
like pleasures to me no more of 
those things did I crave."
240;HALLELUJAH SQUARE;;"I'll see all my friends in 
Hallelujah Square
What a wonderful time we 
will all have up there
We'll sing and praise Jesus, 
His glory to share, 
And you’ll not see one 
cripple in Hallelujah Square.

I saw a blind man, tapping along, 
Loosing his way as he passed 
through the Throng, 
Tears filled my eyes, 
I said friend you can’t see, 
With a smile on his face 
he replied to me...

I'll see all my friends in Hallelujah Square, 
What a wonderful time 
we will al have up there
We’ll sing and praise Jesus 
His glory to share, 
And you’ll not see one blind man in
Hallelujah Square!

Now I saw an old man gasping 
for breath, 
Soon he’d be gone as his eyes 
closed in death, 
He looked at me, said, 
boy don’t look so blue 
I am going up to heaven, 
now how about you?

I’ll see all my friends in 
Hallelujah Square
What a wonderful time 
we will all have up there, 
We’ll sing and praise Jesus 
His glory to share, 
And you’ll not see one 
old man in Hallelujah Square!."
241;JUST LIVING BY FAITH;;"Lord when you saved me, 
by faith I was free
I didn’t know which way to go, 
But Lord you showed me; 
If I trust in your Word, 
Holy Word so divine, 
Just living by faith and walking by faith;
I’ll always be Thine.

CHORUS
Just living by faith, 
faith has no doubt, 
Just living by faith, 
by faith in the Lord,
Things will work out, 
You’ll have no more struggles
then make up your mind, 
Just living by faith, 
and willing by faith, 
His Word is more divine.

Dear Lord you never, 
gave me reason to doubt, 
You were there all the time, 
that I was so blind
Till by faith I reached out, 
By faith Lord I found you and 
by faith I can see,
Just living by faith, 
and I know that by faith
You'll always be mine."
242;MY LORD CAN DO ANYTHING, ANYTIME;;"CHORUS
My Lord can do anything, 
anytime, anywhere, 
My Lord can do anything, 
He makes the lame to rise and walk, 
The deaf to hear, 
the blind to see, 
My Lord can do anything.

He calmed the raging storms
with His Word
Peace be still’ Jesus said 
and that was all;
He raised the dead Lazarus, 
after four days in the grave, 
(My Lord x2) can do anything.

Let your hearts not be troubled 
my Jesus said, 
As you believe in the Father 
believe in Me, 
In my Father’s house there are 
many mansions there;
Behold I go to prepare 
you a place.

Then to the twelve disciples 
Jesus said;
Behold I go to the Father, 
but I’ll return, If you abide in my Word 
then Ill abide in you, 
And then by my power you will do anything.’

How my heart doth rejoice 
just to know
That one morning my Lord shall 
speak and all be changed 
Then He shall call the names of saints
And from the dead they shall
rise in the resurrection morning, 
My Lord can do everything!"
243;BIGGER THAN ANYTHING;;"Bigger than all the shadows 
that fall across my path, 
God is bigger than any mountain 
That I can and cannot see, 
Bigger than all confusions, 
bigger than anything, 
God is bigger than any mountain, 
That I can and cannot see.

CHORUS
Bigger than all my problems,
Bigger than all my fears,
God is bigger than any mountains
That I can and cannot see;
Bigger than all my questions,
Bigger than anything,
God Is bigger than any mountains
That I can and cannot see.

Bigger than all the giants 
of fear and unbelief
God is bigger than any mountain 
That I can and cannot see,
Bigger than all my hang ups, 
bigger than anything, 
God is bigger than any mountain 
That I can and cannot see.

Bigger than all our sorrows 
when death takes one of us, 
God is bigger than any mountain 
That I can and cannot see 
Bigger than all our mourning, 
bigger than anything, 
God is bigger than any mountain 
That I can and cannot see."
244;THE UNSEEN HAND;;"There is an unseen hand to me,
That leads the way I cannot see,
WhiIe going through this world of woe;
His hand still leads me as I go.

CHORUS
I'll trust each day the unseen hand, 
That guides me through this weary land,
 And some sweet day I’ll reach that land, 
Still guided by, the unseen hand.

His hand has led through
shadows drear
And while it leads, I have no fear;
I know it’ll lead me to that home,
Where tears nor sorrows in can come.

I long to see my Saviour’s face,
And sing the story saved by Grace
And thereupon that golden strand,
I’ll praise Him for His guiding hand."
245;SOMEONE TO FOLLOW;;"I have found there is someone
to follow
For He died and He cares for my soul,
And His promises so sure and so true
For He died and cares for me.

CHORUS
Has your soul been saved, 
or you say you don’t care 
Whether you care or don’t care 
sure you need someone 
To take away your sins and 
no- one else can do
Only Jesus who died and cares for you.
Are you going ahead without His joy?
Are you going ahead, 
ahead without His peace? 
For me I know,
 its the last thing in my mind (x2)

Life may be dull and dark every
morning
Every noon, evening, any time,
But you need not stay that way
For one died and cares for you.

It is true and I know that one day,
Something marvellous, wonderful,
When we see Him on whom we
believe
Coming down with clouds for us."
246;JESUS IS COUNTING ON YOU;;"The Lord said, stand up Paul
And dry up your tears
You must preach this gospel
For many long years
Go down to Damascus
The way that is straight
You’ll find Ananias
And there you must wait.

CHORUS
I counted on Jonah, 
I counted on Cain, 
I counted on Adam but he was the 
same I counted on Judas 
but he proved untrue
So go tell the world Paul 
I’m counting on you

Three days have passed by Lord 
And yet I don’t see, and here stands
my brother He’s talking to me
He says brother Paul, 
The Lord in the sky
Has sent me to heal you 
and open your eyes.

I’ll send you to the gentiles, 
I’ll send you to Rome
But Paul you must suffer, 
till I call you home,
They’ll put you in prison,
you’ll wreck out in sea,, 
But Paul you must preach 
all this gospel for me."
247;WHERE WOULD I BE WITHOUT JESUS;;"When my burdens get heavy,
I just kneel on my knees and pray,
I ask the Lord to work them out,
Not mine, 
but His own way
Faith in His own sorrows relief
Oh Without Jesus,.
where would I be?

CHORUS
Where would I be without
Jesus,
Where would I spend eternity?
Lost in a world full of sorrows,
Oh, without Jesus where
would I be?

In Chapter 14, of John verse 
two and three
He said He is preparing a 
place for you and me, 
With Him on my side, 
that’s all I'll ever need, 
For without Jesus where 
would I be?"
248;UNWORTHY AM I;;"Unworthy am I, of the grace that
He gave,
Unworthy to hold His hand
Amazed that a King would reach
down to a slave
His love I cannot understand.

CHORUS
Unworthy, unworthy, a beggar
In bondage and alone,
But He made me worthy,
And now by His grace,
His mercy has made me
His  own.

My sorrows and sickness 
laid stripes on His back, 
My sins caused the blood
 that was shed, 
My faults and my failures 
have won Him a crown, 
Of thorns that He wore 
on His head.

Unworthy am I of the glory divine,
Unworthy with angels to stay,
It thrills just to know that He loves
so much,
A pauper I walk with the King."
249;BORN AGAIN;;"Satan tells me that I only thought I got saved 
He tells me what a fool 
that I have been,
But when my mind goes 
back to that old scene, where I prayed
I know that I've been born again.

CHORUS
Born again, free from sin,
I am happy night and day,
Makes me shout, there’s no doubt
I know I am born again.

Many times along the way 
my faith has grown weak
When burdens seem 
to rise on every hand
But when I see the way in valleys, 
He answers my pleas 
My every need He understands.

Not of the will of man
Nor of the will of the flesh
But by the sovereign plan and will of God
Not of corruptible seed 
Sowed even by evil men
But by the infallible Word of God"
250;I CANNOT FIND THE WAY ALONE;;"As I journey through this veil of sorrows, 
The way seems so strange 
and unknown 
Lord I need a helping 
hand to hold on,
For I cannot find the way alone.

CHORUS
I cannot find the way without you, 
Dear Lord look down from 
Thy Throne
And make the light to shine. 
around me 
For I cannot find the way alone.

I have no other friend to guide me, 
And I'm so weak and undone,
Walk a little close 
Dear Lord beside me, 
For I cannot find the way alone.

When the raging storms of 
life come round me, 
Dear Lord won’t Thou give me 
Thine warmth?
Let me feel Thine arms of 
love around me
For I cannot find the way alone."
251;IT IS I BE NOT AFRAID;;"There was a ship once rolling gently 
Over the sea the Saviour made;
All the disciples of His were in it as
 together this time they stayed 
But the Great Captain was not 
with them, 
On the shore He was delayed, 
They saw a man come waiting 
on the waters saying:
It’s I be not afraid!
Oh! it is I be not afraid

CHORUS
This is the reply that the Saviour made
 Though the night was dark and the
 wind was blowing 
Still with the ship the disciples stayed, 
They saw a man Come walking 
on the waters saying
It is I be not afraid

Aren’t you glad you claim a Saviour 
who can calm the wind and sea, 
While this is the same Dear Jesus 
who said:
Come unto me
So let’s go to the ship’s salvation one
 that sin has never swayed Jesus is 
calling to us gently saying:
It’s I be not afraid!"
252;I'M AN HEIR TO A MANSION IN GLORY;;"I've heard people talk about
heaven,
And describe its beauties so rare,
So one day I purchased a ticket,
To a mansion in that city so fair
It was given to me without money,
But it cost my dear Saviour His life.
He died on the cross without a
murmur
For me He paid the great price.

CHORUS
I'm invited to a mansion in glory
That Jesus has gone to prepare 
Fire cannot touch it, 
thieves cannot harm it, 
And it never will need a repair! 
The termites can’t mar its foundation
For on the Rock of Ages it stands
I feel it is almost completed, 
And ready for me to move in.

My evil deeds were all forgiven
By the Rock of Ages My Lord 
And my name was engraved in 
gold letters, 
On the Lamb’s Book of Life safe within,
Am a heir to a mansion in glory,
Where from this life here I shall go, 
I’m waiting for Jesus to call me, 
Then I’ll lay down my cross and 
go home."
253;IT'S WARM INSIDE HIS ARMS;;"Every year as I grow older, 
the world becomes a little colder, 
My sinful life once filled 
with strife has been transformed, 
My sinful past I still remember, 
but it becomes a little dimmer, 
Co’s its sweet, 
so bright and warm inside His arms.

CHORUS
Do you hide your face in shame, 
Every time you hear His name 
For the way you’ve rejected 
Him each day, 
Repent of all your misbehaviour 
Love and trust the blessed Saviour, 
Corn its sweet, so bright and 
warm inside His arms.

If you’ve spent your whole life waiting
Doubting Him and hesitating 
Worldly pleasures for you 
have lost their charms,
In spite of all the time you've wasted, 
Or the dirty life you’ve tasted 
Still its sweet so bright and 
warm inside His arms."
254;THOUGH SHADOWS DEEPEN;;"Though shadows deepen, 
and my heart bleeds,
 I will not question the way He leads, 
This side of heaven, 
we know in part, 
I will not question a broken heart

CHORUS
We'll talk it over In the by and 
by 
We'll talk it over my Lord and I 
I’ll ask the reason He’ll tell me why
When we talk it over in the by and by.

I’ll trust His leading, He'll never fail,
Through darkest shadows or misty
rays
Obey His teachings and faithful be,
For only one step ahead I see.

I'll hide my heartaches, behind a smile
And wait for reason till after a while 
Although He tries me, 
I know I'll find That all my burdens 
are silvery lined."
255;LAND OF CLOUDLESS DAY;;"Oh, they tell me of a home 
far beyond the sky
Oh, they tell me of a home 
far away;
Oh, they tell me of a home 
where no storm clouds rise, 
Oh, they tell me of a non-cloudy day.

CHORUS
Oh the land of cloudless day 
Oh the land of the non-cloudy day 
Oh they tell me of a home where 
no storm clouds rise, 
In that city of a non-cloudy day.

Oh, they tell me of a King in 
His beauty there, 
And they tell me that my 
eyes shall behold
Where He sits on His Throne 
that is whiter than snow
In that city that is made of gold.

Oh, they tell me of a home where 
my friends have gone, 
Oh, they tell me of a land far away 
Where the Tree of Life shall 
forever bloom, 
Shedding fragrance thro’ 
the non-cloudy day.

Oh they tell me that He smiles 
on His children there,
And His smile drives their sorrows 
all away;
And they tell me that no 
tears ever come again
In that lovely land of a non- 
cloudy day."
256;THE LORD HAS BROUGHT US A LONG WAY;;"Now I want you to picture, 
Jesus on the cross
The nails on His hands and 
on His feet, 
The thorns on His head, 
Have you ever asked the 
question suppose it was you
All the great pains on the 
cross to bear, 
Just to save another man.

CHORUS
(Oh) the Lord has brought 
us a long way, 
A long way from sin And we 
have been appointed servants 
of the Lord We have come a 
long way, 
a long way from sin Because we 
have a message from the Lord.

Now I want to tell you from the
Word of God,
The answer to the question that is
In your mind
The reason that Jesus died was to
Save us from sin
The great pain He had to bear 
just to save you and me."
257;THIS IS OLD TIME RELIGION;;"Some people say, 
this is old time religion
It’s just a thing of the past, 
But in these modern days 
that we are living
It’s just the thing that will last. 
Well, you may think I’m a 
little old fashioned
Well, friends that’s alright for me:
But I am so glad that I am a 
Christian from sins I have 
been set free.

CHORUS
I know, I know, there is no 
doubt about it,
He lives in my heart and am 
gonna shout it, I know, 
I know, my sins were all forgiven
And am on my way to a 
place that’s called heaven.

Not long ago, in an old 
fashioned meeting I knelt there 
on my knees and I prayed, 
He lifted my burdens sins 
shackles fell from me
His presence was present 
everywhere.
Now that the load I carry is lighter, 
He’s turned my grey skies to blue. 
My steps are higher I have 
this assurance
That His sweet love will 
carry me through

Come let us go to a land over yonder,
Its prepared for the pure and the true
It’ a place where sickness and death
can’t enter
I’m going my friend how about you?
May be today or may be tomorrow
He’ll return
In robes of pure white:
Am packing up now getting all things
together
Who knows He may come tonight."
258;I'M A POOR WAYFARING STRANGER;;"I'm just a poor wayring stranger, 
Travelling through this 
world of woe, 
Yet there’s no sickness, 
sorrow or danger
In that bright land to which I go.

CHORUS
I'm going there to see my
Father
I'm going there no more to
roam,
I’m just going over Jordan
I’m just going over home.

And though dark clouds will 
gather round me
I know my way is rough and steep 
Yet beauteous fields lie 
just before rne
Where God’s redeemed their vigils 
keep.

I’m going there to see my mother, 
She said she’d meet me when I come
I’m only going over jordan 
I’m only going over home."
259;TOO MANY MILES;;"Too many miles behind me
Too many trials are past
Too many tears help me to
remember
That there’s too much to gain to lose.

CHORUS
Too many sunsets lie behind 
the mountain 
Too many rivers my feet have 
walked through 
Too many treasures are waiting 
over yonder, 
(But) There’s too much to gain
to lose.

I crossed the hot burning desert, 
Struggling the right roads to choose
Somewhere up ahead 
there are cool clear waters
And defeat is one word I'll never use"
260;SINNER YOU BETTER GET READY;;"CHORUS
Oh sinner you better get ready, 
Oh, you better get ready 
hallelujah Sinner, 
you better get ready
 For a time’s a’coming when
 the sinner must die.

Oh God gave Noah the rainbow sign, 
Time’s a’coming when
 the sinner must die, 
It won’t be by water, 
but by fire next time, 
Time’s a’coming when
 the sinner must die.

Thought I heard all the preachers say
The time’s a’coming when 
the sinner must die, 
You better get down 
on your knees and pray
The time’s a’coming when 
the sinner must die.

I heard my mother and sister saying
Time’s coming when the sinner
must die,
I heard my father and brother
saying
Dear sister, you better come now."
261;WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN;;"Will the circle be unbroken 
by and by, Lord by and by
There’s a better home awaiting 
In the sky Lord In the sky.

I was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw the horse come rolling
For to carry my mother away.

Lord I told that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For that lady you are hauling
Lord I hate to see her go.

I will follow close behind her
Try to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave.

Went back home, my home was
lonesome
Since my mother she had gone,
Found my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lonely.

Glory, glory hallelujah,
It will be a glorious day
Glory, glory, hallelujah
We shall meet to part no more."
262;FAR BEYOND THE SUN;;"When salvation story, 
ends in heaven’s glory
And by sight I witness 
What my Lord has done, 
Helping me surrender, 
by His love so tender
Giving me a mansion,

CHORUS
Far beyond the sun
Far beyond the sun,
Far beyond the sun,
I have a home, 
a beautiful home,
Far beyond the sun.

Unto every nation, 
full of free salvation, 
God so freely offered 
Through His precious Son
Soon shall come the dawning, 
of that happy morning, 
When the Lord shall take us, 
far beyond the sun."
263;I WILL BE THERE ANYWAY;;"I hope to live till Jesus comes
 back to this earth again,
 And catches up His chosen bride, 
a thousand years to reign, 
But should I die before that time 
I know this empty clay,
 Will be caught up to meet the Lord; 
I’ll be there anyway.

CHORUS
Oh praise the Lord for this
great hope
That cheers me day by day,
For if I’m not caught up alive,
I’ll be there anyway.

So farewell friends if we should 
part on earth to meet no more,
 I’ll meet you in the skies some day 
when earthy clouds are rolled 
But should I die before that time and 
you are alive that day, 
Just look for me for I intend, 
to be there anyway."
264;WHEN JOHN CAME PREACHING;;"When John came preaching, 
preparing the way, 
For Jesus the heavenly King; 
For all who believed and
 trusted in His name, 
Would stand in God’s kingdom 
and not be ashamed.

CHORUS
Let the Spirit descend, 
like a beautiful dove,
 As it did on Jesus that day 
He was baptized by John, 
in the river of Jordan, 
God’s voice like thunder spoke
This Is my Son.

When Lazarus lay dead,
 in the grave four days,
Martha sent for Jesus to come, 
Said Lazarus, come forth 
and he heard what He said
 Lazarus life flowed back, 
he arose from the dead."
265;THESE HANDS ARE MADE OF CLAY;;"These hands are made 
of clay I know
These hands are made from dust 
But my soul shall live for ever more 
If in my God I trust.

CHORUS
This body has grown so tired 
Oh Lord
With these old and work won hands,
 But when I die, 
I know my soul shall rest 
Up there in God’s great hands.

Though these two feet, 
are made from earth.
And to earth they must return, 
But when my soul shall reach its goal,
Is now my great concern."
266;CHRIST IS MY SUNSHINE;;"When I was down and needed
Someone
Someone to keep me every day
It was then and then that I found
my Jesus
I am so glad that He came my way.

CHORUS
Christ Is my sunshine, 
my only sunshine, 
He makes me happy, 
when the skies are grey
He changed my life and my ways 
completely,
 So, please don’t take my sunshine 
away.

I’m happy now with Jesus near me,
A friend is He, a friend indeed, 
The worldly friends may 
all forsake me, 
My Jesus will be all I’ll need.

I’ll always love Him and 
sing His praises, 
He’ll be with me throughout 
the day, 
At night He’ll guide me I 
won’t be lonely 
Please don’t take my sunshine
away."
267;I'M ALMOST HOME;;"For many long years, 
I've travelled life’s road
I'm weary and tired of carrying 
life’s load, 
So often times am tempted by 
Satan to bow, 
But I’m journeying home, 
to turn back no!

CHORUS
Almost home, 
I’m almost home,
I know my race Is almost run,
Though troubles and sorrows 
have already come 
But I can’t turn back now 
I am too near home

When I stand at the river, 
that homeland I see, 
With its beautiful mansion 
He has prepared for me, 
Just a few days to linger,
then I’ll go across
And I know what awaits me 
will be worth it all!"

Lean on His arms, all His mercies prove, 
Lean on His arms ever looking home 
above,

Just follow gladly where He leadeth, 
His gentle voice obey.

Oh bring every care, bring every care,
The burden that has seemed so
heavy
Take to the Lord in prayer.

need
To all who take Him as a Saviour,
He is a friend indeed."

thief in the night,
Tho the world will 
go on as before,
But to the gentiles 
He'll close heaven’s door.

I'm so glad that
I saw the light 
And thank God that
I made things right;
I believe it is any time my friend, 
Look at the world,
it’s as dark as the night.

to wash your sins away

Look in God’s word and
you'll  find Him there."
270;I SENT FORTH A MAN;;"There will be many that day, 
come to Jesus and say,
Have we not preached the gospel 
and prayed in your name, 
But Jesus will say, 
I never, even knew you
You turned down the truth that I 
sent your way

CHORUS
I sent forth a man with the spirit 
of Elijah 
He had THUS SAITH THE LORD
As He cried out against sin,
He cried come out,
don’t partake of their evils
And he said follow me, 
like I follow Christ.

There was a sign for the Gentiles, 
as Paul had in his day 
It was the pillar of fire that met 
him on the way
Now if you won’t believe what 
His servant had to say :
You'll be judged by the word and 
Jesus will say,"
271;EVERY TIME I FEEL THE SPIRIT;;"Upon the mountain my Lord spoke 
Out of His mouth came fire and smoke
I looked all around me it looked so fine
I asked my Lord if all was mine.

CHORUS
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving In my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the spirit
Moving In my heart I will pray.

Jordan river, chilly and cold 
Chills the body not the soul
There is but one train upon this track
It goes to heaven and then right back.

Oh I’ve got sorrows and I’ve got woes
And I have got heartaches here below
So when I am praying down on my knees
Oh, help me Jesus if you may please.

Some people worry, 
 and some complain
The way they grumble it is a shame
I try to tell them of a better way
Of the Spirit and how to pray."
272;I WILL, GOD HELPING ME;;"Once more my soul the Saviour 
through the world
Is offered full and free

I will Oh Lord be Thine
Thy precious blood was shed
to purchase me
I will be wholly Thine.

By grace I will Thy mercy now receive
Thy love my heart has won 
On Thee Oh Christ I will, 
I will believe
And trust in Thee alone.

Thou knowest Lord,
how very weak I am
And how I fear to stray,
For strength to serve I look to
Thee alone,
The strength Thou must supply.

And now Oh Lord give 
all with us to stay
Thy grace to join our song, 
And from the heart to gladly 
with us stay
I will to Christ belong.

To all who came when 
Thou was here below, 
And said, Oh Lord will Thou?
To them I will, was ever your reply
We rest upon it now."
273;HAVE YOU COUNTED THE COST?;;"There is a line that is drawn 
 by rejecting our Lord,
Where the call of His Spirit is lost 
And you hurry along, 
 with a pleasure mad throng 
Have you counted? 
Have you counted the cost?

CHORUS
Have you counted the cost
 if your soul should be lost 
Though you gain the whole world 
 for your own, 
Even though it may be, that the line 
 you have crossed, 
Have you counted? 
Have you counted the cost?

You may barter your hope of eternity 
reign
For a moment of joy at the most
For the glitter of sin and the things
 it will win
Have you counted? 
Have you counted the cost?

While the door of mercy is open to 
 you
Even though the depth of His love 
 you exhaust
Won’t you come and be healed, 
 won’t you whisper I yield
Have you counted? Have you
 counted the cost?"
274;I HAVE A PRECIOUS FRIEND;;"I have a friend, a precious friend,
Oh how He loves me
He says His love will never end
Oh how He loves me.

CHORUS

Oh, how He loves me.

Why He should come I cannot tell
Oh, how He loves me,
In my poor broken heart to dwell
Oh, how He loves me.

He died to save my soul from death,
Oh, how He loves me,
I will praise Him while He gives me breath 
Oh, how He loves me.

He walks with me along life’s road,
Oh, how He loves me
He carries every heavy load,
Oh, how He loves me.

He has a home prepared for me,
Oh, how He loves me,
With Him I'll spend eternity
Oh, how He loves me."
275;IT'S WORTH IT ALL TO BE HIS CHILD;;"CHORUS
It’s worth it all to be His child 
To serve Him through the 
last long mile
It’s worth It all to feel His power, 
And to know He keeps us 
every Hour.


Sometimes we’re tried 
and things go wrong
We sometimes say, Oh, 
Lord how long?
Let’s trust in Him and wear a smile,
 It’s worth it all to be His child.

Although we bear, reproach and
shame,
It’s worth it all for His dear name,
The toils of life may rise and fall,
But the love of God is worth it all.

When here on earth our race is run,
We see the rays of the setting sun,
When we shall hear that final call
We’ll tell the world its been worth it
all."
276;UP CALVARY'S MOUNTAIN;;"Up calvary's mountain

Facing for sinners,

That He might save them,
from endless loss.

Blessed Redeemer, 
precious Redeemer 
Seems now I see Him on calvary’s tree 
Wounded and bleeding,
 for sinners pleading, 
Blind and unheeding, dying for me!

Through years unnumbered, 
on heaven’s shore My tongue 
shall praise Him for ever more."
277;WE SHALL REST AT JESUS FEET;;"All the troubles and heartaches 
we’ve known here below
 As we travel this wearisome land, 
We’re pilgrims and strangers looking
 for a home, 
Till the day when we'll lay our burdens 
down.

CHORUS
One day we shall rest at Jesus feet
When the troubles of this life will be o’er
Where death cannot enter there’ll be 
no more night 
In that city where the Lamb Is the light.

Oh the river of life, in that city of gold
Is prepared for His loving bride 
Just think of the mansion no man 
could describe
And it's glory that our eyes shall behold."
278;I WILL LOVE AND SERVE YOU LORD;;"Oh, Lord my God, you did 
not spare your Son 
Who gave His life and shed 
His blood on calvary’s tree 
Who in my place, 
bore all the shame, 
That I may love and serve you 
Lord until you come again.

CHORUS
(Lord) until you come again  x2
I'll love you and I'll serve you
Lord
Until you come again.

Great Redeemer, 
great things you’ve done
Of saving a helpless sinner like 
me from Satan’s bonds
It was your plan, to save my soul, 
That I may love and serve you
 Lord until you come again.

So when I cry, you hearken 
to my cry,
 And help me Lord when I’m 
oppressed from all sides 
And when I’m down, just about to fail,
You give me strength to keep me 
standing until you come again."

Telling the world that the Saviour 
has come
Be not dismayed if men don’t 
believe you, 
He’ll understand and say well done.
Heil understand and say well done.

CHORUS
Oh when I come to the end of life’s 
Journey Weary of life and the 
battle Is won, 
Carrying the staff and the cross of
redemption 
He’ll understand and say well done, x2

Misunderstood, the Saviour of Sinners, 
Hang on the cross He was God’s only 
Son 
Oh hear Him call His Father in 
heaven
Let not my will but Thine be done. x 2

If when this life of labour is ended, 
And the reward of the race you have run
Take up the sweet rest prepared for the 
faithful, 
Will be His blest and final well done. x 2

But if you try and fail in your trying, 
Hands sore and scarred from the 
work you’ve began
Take up thy cross run quickly to Jesus

280;THERE ARE MANY MANSIONS;;"Down the streets I see them building 
a mansion 
A lot of time is spent in 
building worldly fame
Until I’ve learned to live 
in a mansion
One that’s built by 
the King of Kings.

CHORUS
I don't care for things on 
earth or treasure
For life is too short for me to spend 
It chasing dreams 
But up yonder, 
we’ll live on for ever, 
in a kingdom ruled by the 
King of Kings.

In my Father’s house, 
there are many mansions
If it were not so I would have 
told you so, 
I’ll be leaving and some day 
I will join Him in that city
 where the streets are as 
pure as gold."

to do 
The little things or big things 
You’ve wanted me to do 
I’ve let you down Jesus, 
That's not hard to see
Jesus, Oh Jesus, 
don’t give up on me.

CHORUS
Stand by me Jesus 
forgive me somehow
If there’s any hope left
don’t leave me now
I might be worth saving 
I’m trying to be Jesus 
Oh Jesus, don’t give up on me.

It's late I know, and I’ve made

But don’t turn the light out
Don't close the door

All the scars that marred

With great triumph 
He'll be rapturing the saints."

1032;ON A HILL FAR AWAY;;"On a hill far away stood
an old rugged cross
Where the King of kings
was crucified
From His head, hands and feet
came out blood,
so precious blood
That made a difference from 
the other blood atoned

Chorus
It is the blood that surpasses,
every other blood
The blood of animals could not 
atone the sins of men
It is the blood that has power,
to set the captive free
Thank you Jesus for the
shedding of the blood.

From that time to this time
the blood of Jesus still avails
It has never lost its power,
the cleansing power
Whoever comes to the blood
will be washed white as snow
I will ever be true and faithful
to the blood."

1034;DON'T TELL ME WHAT HE MEANT;;"Now the same old devil gave 
the same old problems
When the Lord walked the 
earth down here,
He was always deceiving and 
causing confusion
To anyone who would hear,
He was always trying to cause unbelief
For he didn't want a poor soul to see,
That all you've gotta do is only believe
Just believe what the Messenger said.


CHORUS
Don't tell me what He meant,
Just tell me what He said,
Don't tell me what He meant,
Just tell me what He said,
I don't have no time, for private 
interpretations my friend,
Just tell me what he said,
Don't tell me what he meant, Oh no!
Tell me what he said,
And don't tell me what he meant.

Now today strange voices we can hear
All over throughout the land,
Trying to teach what the Messenger said
They just sell so much 
higher than him,
They've got a new revelation 
and interpretation
And they'll tell you they're the leaders now,
But Little Bride you just stay with the tapes 
God's vindicated what His Messenger said."
1035;IN CHRIST ALONE;;"In Christ alone, my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song,
This Cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease,
My Comforter, my All in All,
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe,
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
Till on that cross, where Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For every sin on Him was laid,
So here in the power of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain,
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again.
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His, and He is mine,
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me,
From a life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, No scheme of man,
Could ever pluck me from His hand,
Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in the death of Christ I live."
1036;AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE;;"When God delivered Israel 
from bondage that day,
By a prophet a Pillar of Fire to 
guide them on their way,
But true to man's nature and just like today,
They looked back toward Egypt 
and in their hearts fell away.

CHORUS
As for me and my house 
we'll serve only the Lord,
We'll walk in His Footsteps 
believe only His Word,
We'll raise up our children in the 
fear of the Lord,
And there'll arise a generation 
that knows not the Lord.

When Joshua led them over 
to that promised land,
They were happy and rejoicing enemies 
fell at their hands,
But when Joshua's days were ended 
and he lay down his sword,
There arose a generation that 
knew not the Lord.

Let us fight the good fight from day to day,
And like Moses said to Pharaoh 
we're off going out to pray,
A Lamb for a house with the Blood all applied,
We will claim our whole families 
to march by our side."
1037;CAMEL TRAIN;;"'Twas a day in early springtime,
By an ancient wayside well,
Eliezer paused to rest his camel train.
He had found a bride for Isaac
Ere the evening shadows fell,
For his weary journey had not been
 in vain.

CHORUS 
Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall.
Don’t you hear the Eliezer's call?
There’s going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train 
comes in.

So he took the fair Rebekah,
Dressed in jewels rich and rare,
Quickly to her waiting bridegroom far 
away.
Where Rebekah loved her Isaac,
And he loved Rebekah fair;
Oh, it must have been a happy 
wedding day.

Now the blessed Holy Spirit,
From our Father God above,
Has come down to earth to find a 
worthy Bride.
For our Isaac over yonder
Has prepared His tents of love,
And He wants His fair Rebekah 
by His side.

We have left our kinfolk gladly;
We have bade the world goodbye.
We’ve been called to be His pure and 
spotless Bride;
Where we’ll soon behold our Jesus
In that blest eternity
What a happy, happy wedding that 
will be!"
1038;DON'T QUIT;;"When things go wrong as 
they sometimes will,
And the road you're travelling 
seems all uphill,
When the money's low 
and the debts are high,
And you want to smile but you
 just have to sigh.


CHORUS
Don't quit, Don't quit
Just stick to the fight when 
you're hardest hit,
Don't quit, Don't quit
It's when things seem worst, 
that you must not quit.

Don't give up tho the pace, 
may seem so slow,
Remember God gives, you grace 
as you go,
A winner never quits and 
a quitter never wins,
Oh you can't go wrong if you 
depend on Him."

Sang as they welcomed His birth,
""Glory to God in the highest!
Peace and good tidings to earth.""

Chorus
Tell me the story of Jesus,
Write on my heart every word;
Tell me the story most precious,
Sweetest that ever was heard.

Fasting alone in the desert,
Tell of the days that are past,
How for our sins He was tempted,
Yet was triumphant at last.
Tell of the years of His labor,
Tell of the sorrow He bore;
He was despised and afflicted,
Homeless, rejected and poor.

Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,
Writhing in anguish and pain;
Tell of the grave where they laid Him,
Tell how He liveth again.
Love in that story so tender,
Clearer than ever I see;
Stay, let me weep while you whisper,
""Love paid the ransom for me."""

Perish every fond ambition, all I've sought, 
 and hoped or known;
Yet how rich is my condition, 
 God and heaven are still my own!

Let the world despise and leave me, 
 they have left my Savior too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me; 
 Thou art not, like man, untrue;
And, while Thou shalt smile upon me, 
 God of wisdom, love and might,
Foes may hate and friends may shun me; 
 show Thy face and all is bright.

Go, then, earthly fame and treasure!
 Come, disaster, scorn and pain!
In Thy service, pain is pleasure;
 with Thy favor, loss is gain
I have called Thee, ""Abba, Father;"" 
 I have set my heart on Thee:
Storms may howl, and clouds may gather, 
 all must work for good to me.


Man may trouble and distress me, 
 'twill but drive me to Thy breast;_
Life with trials hard may press me, 
 heaven will bring me sweeter rest.
O 'tis not in grief to harm me, 
 while Thy love is left to me;
O 'twere not in joy to charm me, 
 were that joy unmixed with Thee.

Hasten on from grace to glory, 
 armed by faith, and winged by prayer;
Heaven's eternal day's before me, 
 God's own hand shall guide me there.
Soon shall close my earthly mission, 
 swift shall pass my pilgrim days;
Hope shall change to glad fruition, 
 faith to sight, and prayer to praise."

If you should mock iniquity 
Which of us could stand
How could we get through this life 
Without your guiding hand
So Lord we ask you forgive our failures
and deliver us from all temptations
and make us strong strong strong
and make us strong strong strong


We know we're not deserving 
Of all your graciousness
We know we fail you daily
And sometimes misbehave
But Lord we love you we want to serve you
Yes Lord we need you and we believe you
Lord help us overcome
Lord help us overcome

Oh yes you have redeemed us 
By your precious blood
Your power brought deliverance 
When Satan came like a flood
and Lord we see you strong in battle
Yes Lord we see you breaking the shackle
And giving us joy joy joy
And giving us joy joy joy"
1051;JUSTIFIED;;"About what I'm supposed to do
I can't deny sometimes I make mistakes 
I can't hide but neither can you
But I know deep down within my soul
I felt sorry for things i done
So I just cried and said forgive me Lord 
Forgive me again, will you?

chorus
Justified, Justified
You have not done it
in the first place  you're justified
justified justified
You have not done
in the first place you're justified

So often I'm discouraged 
When I count the times I fall
But he promised I'd be victorious
When I knew I'm not at all
Then I heard an eagle scream 
And his voice awakened my soul
He said you've not done it 
In the first place you're justified


He looks at your perfect picture
Without blame spot or wrinkle
He didn't look at you from where 
you are now
He looked back from eternity
He said you're just trapped in that body 
You bypassed your theophany
You have not done it 
In the first place you're justified"
1052;VICTORY AND GLORY;;"I have heard but now i see 
God's promise to you and me
All these years through thick and thin

and I can see me and you (hallelujah)
Then God's silence was broken through
and I can see me and you

We couldn't understand all what had to be believed
Many thought that we were off on a limp

And just tonight in a neighbor country
God decided to display himself
And just tonight in a neighbour country

Now we are climbing higher each day
Conquering all devils who stand in our way

To fulfill a riotousness

1054;HIDE ME AWAY;;"A desire is burning in my heart
To draw closer to you lord
I've been living too far apart
Obedient I want to be
You living inside of me
I know you'll settle for nothing less 
than to look at me and see yourself

CHORUS
So hide me away Oh Lord
In your bosom I want to be
Into your secret place 
My deepest desire lord
Is all of you Oh Lord 
I'm crying out prayerfully
Seeking your Holy face 
For all you have promised me 

Lord I've had many victories before
But now I see the world is shaking 
My life is shaking Lord I need you more
The enemy's at the door
He's determined to destroy me
But I'll live a victorious life 
like Jesus Christ Lord
Take all that is not of thee

And I believe you answer prayer
Lord I believe you answer prayer
(With all my heart)  I believe 
you answer prayer
As I call on Thee, I call on you Lord
For I know you answer prayer
(you did it for Jonah)
Lord I know you answer prayer
Lord I know you'll answer my prayer
As I call on thee"
1055;AGAINST THE ODDS;;"Who could ever believe that Mary a virgin 
Would ever conceive and 
bring forth Messiah
Who could ever tell that Elisabeth 
her cousin
Would be the mother to Christ fore-runner
Although many forces 
came and stood in the way
They could never ever stop God's program
Always in opposition to 
what the Creator declares
Gross darkness stands intimidating

CHORUS
And it comes - To hide away
Then tries to - Brush off
Even - denying the process of creation 
But who can stand- in the way - of the great- S-O-N
When he begins to shine - on a new dawn
the very spoken word - by the mighty angel
Will put- flesh - and  in you  become - material
Here I am standing - against the odds
Here I am the word made flesh - against the odds
Here  I am the masterpiece -against the odds
Here I am God in flesh again - against the odds
Here I  am a living epistle - against the odds
To prove that God's word can never fail
To prove that God's word has got to pass

Who could ever believe that 
Abraham an old man
Would see his body changed 
into a young man
Who could ever tell that Sarah who did laugh
Would receive the strength to 
bring forth the promised son
Although all surrounding nations 
were plunged in great sin
They could never ever stop God's program
Always in opposition of what 
the Creator declares 
Gross darkness stands intimidating

Who could ever believe that Mrs. Jesus
Would stand so tall and so beautiful
Who could ever tell that this bride of Christ
Would finally understand who she really is
Even though the whole of hell 
Comes up on this earth to fight
They could never ever stop God's program
Always in opposition to 
what the Creator declares 
Gross darkness stands intimidating"
1056;WHEN IT'S ALL BEEN SAID AND DONE;;"When it's all been said and done
There is just one that matters
Did I do my best to live for truth?
Did I live my life for you?

CHORUS
When it's all been said and done
All my treasures will mean nothing
Only what I have done 
For love's rewards
Will stand the test of time

Lord your mercy is so great
That you look beyond our weakness
That you found purest gold in miry clay
Turning sinners into saints

I will always sing your praise
Here on earth and in heaven after
For you've joined me at my true home
When it's all been said and done
You're my life when life is gone…"

1059;ON MY KNEES;;"The time has come 
Divine revelation in God's word
His grace I see
When I think how He has chosen me
And it happens every day
When I begin to pray
It burns within my heart 
The things he always says
He revealeth unto me
What I was born to be in this day

So I'm staying, on my knees
Patiently waiting, on my knees
For your outpouring, On my knees
Oh Lord I need you, on my knees

I believe I was born a 
predestinated seed
Amazing grace has chosen 
me to run this race
I will give my life to him perfected 
without sin
I can't do this on my own 
Lord put flesh on these dry bones
If it takes this life to give
Then for you I will live
I need you Lord

When You come You will meet me,
on my knees.
In consecration, on my knees
I need the Holy Spirit, on my knees
Lord I’m not moving, on my knees

I've read the scriptures in the Bible
About the mighty gentile worriors
The painful desire of Hannah
And the fearless move of Esther
Lord I believe that they were true
And the Token they received 
But what about me

I know my battles are all won,
That’s why I sing my song.
I know blessings are all mine,
 but it will just take time.
So like Elijah here I stand with Faith 
in such a way, to know You’ll come"
1060;BUT FOR THE BLOOD;;"I had no one to blame
How I longed to hide my face
I was so ashamed
of all the wrongs I've done
And I knew I had to pay 
For I was  bound to
face hell flames
I would be there today
My friend but for the blood

Chorus
But for the blood, shed
on Calvry's tree
But for the blood there would be
no hope for you and me
For all my righteousness are filthy rags
And that's all I'd ever be
But for the blood that cleansed 
and set me free

Even now I get so low
And the devil lets me know
Am so undeserving
Am unworthy of God's love
And oh yes, I know it's true
But here I stand with chosen few
And I am here today
Yes am saved just by the blood"
1062;FAMILY BIBLE;;"There's a family bible on the table
each page is torn and hard to read 
but this family bible on the table
will ever be my key to memory

CHORUS
I can see us sitting round the table 
as from the familly bible 
dad would read 
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages 
cleft for me

At the end of the day when 
work was over
and when the evening 
meal was done
Dad would read to us from the 
family bible
and we'd count our many 
blessings one by one

This old world of ours is full of trouble
This old world also better be
if we found more bibles on the table
And mothers singing Rock of Ages 
cleft for me"
1063;TWILL BE WORTH IT AFTER ALL;;"We need our spirit filled preachers
To teach us right from wrong
We need the old fashioned seekers
Who'll pray all night long
We need some good gospel singing
To help us go another mile
The church will triumph
And go home in a little while

CHORUS
Twill be worth it after all Church
Twill be worth it after all
After all of this trying
We'll hear Jesus' call
Twill be worth it after all Church
Twill be worth it after all
After all of these trials
Twill be worth it after all 

When you're down in the valley
Prayer is all I can do
For the Lord sends deliverance
And strengthens you
Now if you're up on the mountain
And see me struggling along
Lift my name up to Jesus
Let's help each other make it home"
1064;IF THAT ISN'T LOVE;;"He left the splendor of heaven
Knowing His destiny was 
The lonely hill of Golgotha 
There to lay down His
life for me

Chorus
If that isn't love 
The ocean is dry
There's no stars in the sky
And the sparrow can't fly
If that isn't love isn't love
Then heaven's a myth 
There's no feeling like this
If that isn't love

Even in death He remembered 
The thief hanging by His side
He spoke with love 
and compassion
Then took Him to paradise"

1066;WHERE NO ONE STANDS ALONE;;"Once I stood in the night 
with my head bowed low
In the darkness, 
as black as could be
And I felt all alone
And I cried oh Lord
Don't hide your face from me

CHORUS
Hold my hand all the way
Every hour every day
From here to the great unknown
Take my hand
Let me stand
Where no one stands alone

Like a king I may live in 
a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing
In this whole wide world
Thats worse than being alone"
1067;WHAT A LOVEY NAME;;"There's a Name above all others
Wonderful to hear bringing 
hope and cheer
It's a lovely name the name of Jesus, 
Ever more I say what a lovely name

chorus
What a lovely name the name of Jesus
Reaching high afar than the brightest star
It is sweeter than all the songs 
they sing in heaven
Let the world proclaim what a 
lovely name

Here we journey in clouds of glory
Shades of every race, charming on 
his face
We will enter heavens city 
Ever to proclaim what a lovely name

Through His name there's wondrous 
power
Power to redeem every sinner clean
By his power he cleansed the lepers
Opened blinded eyes caused 
dead men to rise"
1068;PRESENT YOUR BODY AS A LIVING SACRIFICE;;"CHORUS
Present your body as a living sacrifice
It's your reasonable service 
For You've been bought with a price
Present your body as a living sacrifice
It's your reasonable service 
For You've been bought with a price

The precious blood of Jesus
of the sinless spotless Lamb
Shed for you and I fallen men
How he loved us with a love 
Even before this world began
Considered you and in 
His redemption plan
How we should love him
And be prisoners of his word
Bound by the chains of love divine


The whole creation groaneth 
and travaileth until now
For the manifestation of the sons of God
He's rent the veil of vain tradition 
brought His image in plain view   
Now veils His glory in oddballs 
like me and you                   
Now we despise Satan's Eden
Die to ourselves day by day
Perfect faith is the victory we must attain

A servant at suppertime  
came with the secrets in God's mind
Proclaimed our liberty 
Bringing many sons to glory
How we tore our filthy rags 
in exchange of robes so clean and white
to sit in God's presence taking 
our place in His plan
how we should be thankful He 
has chosen you and me
we are the reason we are his victory"
1069;LORD I'M AVAILABLE;;"You gave me my hands 
to reach out to men 
to show them your love and 
your perfect plan
You gave me my ears so
I can hear your voice so clear 
I can hear the cries of sinners
that cannot wipe away their tears

chorus
Lord I'm available to you, 
My will I give to you I do 
what you say do
Use me Lord to show 
someone the way 
And enable me to say
My storage is empty 
and I am available to you

Now I'm giving back to you 
all of the tools you gave to me
My hands my ears my eyes my voice 
you can use them as you please
Now I've emptied out my cup 
so you can come and fill it up
So Lord all I want to be

1070;JESUS TAKE THIS TRIAL TRIP BESIDE ME;;"This world is just a bridge to Heaven
This life is just a trial trip we're on
We may see four score years and seven
Before we ever find our way back home

So, Jesus take this trial trip beside me
You know I'll never make it all alone
You've been down here and 
You know how to guide me
From this old world to God's eternal 
throne

(And)The only way I gonna get to Glory
The only way I'll reach the other side
Is to walk the way my Master shows me
So blessed Jesus won't You 
come and be my Guide"
1072;GOD WILL MAKE A WAY;;"Chorus
God will make a way
Where there seems to be no way
He works in ways we cannot see
He will make a way for me

He will be my guide
Hold me closely to his side
With love and strength for 
Each new day
He will make a way, he will make a way

By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me
And rivers in the desert will I see
Heaven and earth will fade 
But his word will still remain
And he will do something new today"
1073;WHEN KING JESUS COMES;;"All the armies of the world will 
Someday gather
And they'll pass before the 
Great reviewing stand
And they'll beat their swords and 
Weapons into plowshares
And the Prince of Peace shall give 
The last command

Chorus
When King Jesus comes to live 
With us again
He will show His righteous 
Love to every man
Wars and strife will all be passed
There'll be peace on earth at last
When King Jesus comes to 
Live with us again

Unobscured  the sun will drive 
Away the shadows
At the dawning of that great  
Eternal day
And there'll  be no sounds 
Of crying in the ghetto
For all grief and pain and death 
Shall pass away"
1112;ANGELS IN THE ROOM;;"She's close to death , but she is not afraid
Angels waiting for the order, to carry her away
They're gathered around her bed side
She's the only one who sees 
She will draw her final breath , 
and away with them she'll leave


Angels in the room , she's run her final race
They come to carry her to heaven 
there to see her Savior's face
Angels in the room, to take her to
 a great reward
No need for sadness or gloom, 
there are angels in the room


He's not long for this world, 
there's a better one to come
He's think'in about that great reunion , 
with the father and the son
His family by his bedside,
he says children can't you see
Angels standing all around us, 
it's time for me to leave


Angels in the room, he's run his final race
They come to carry him to heaven
There to see his Savior's face
Angels in the room, to take him to his
 great reward
No need for sadness or gloom, 
there are angels in the room

When it comes a time for leaven 
And you see the fights are long
You won't have to worry friend
You won't be alone

Angels in the room, when you 
run your final race
They will carry you to heaven
There to see your Savior's face 
Ooh.. Angels in the room, to take 
you to your great reward
No need for sadness or gloom,

1113;STEP INTO THE WATER;;"Chorus
Step into the water
Wade out a little bit deeper
Wet your feet in the water
Of His love
Step into the water
Wade out a little bit deeper
Come join angels singing
Praises to the Lamb of God

It's time we the people
Stand up for what is right
It is time we squared our shoulders back
Raised our swords to fight
For the Bible is my weapon
And the Spirit is my shield
The church needs more of its members
To be workers in the field

There is victory for the Christian
Who walks the narrow way
There has been a prize appointed
For the soul who does not stray
Oh, I want to live for Jesus
Be all that I should be
So that I can rest with Him forever
Live eternally"
282;I AM GOING HOME;;"Many times in my childhood, 
when we travelled so far, 
By nightfall how weary
 I’d grown 
Father’s arm would slip around me, 
So gently He’d say, 
my child we’re going home.

CHORUS
Going home, I am going home 
There is nothing to hold me here, 
While I’ve caught a glimpse 
of that heavenly land, 
Praise God, I am going home.

Now the twilight is fading
and the day soon will end
I get homesick for Father I long 
But my Father has led me 
each step of the way
And now we’re going home.

Oh my heart gets so heavy 
and I’m longing to see,
 All my loved ones and friends
 I have known
Every step draws me nearer 
to the land of my dreams,
 Praise God I am going home."
283;FILL MY CUP LORD;;"Like the woman at the well 
I was seeking, 
For things that 
would not satisfy
Till when I heard 
my Saviour speaking;
Draw from my well 
that never shall run dry.

CHORUS
Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up Lord, 
Come and quench this thirsting 
of my soul 
Bread of heaven, feed me 
till I want no more
Fill my cup, fill it up and make
me whole.

There are millions in this world 
who are seeking
For pleasures earthly things afford 
But none can match the wondrous
treasures
That I have in Jesus Christ my Lord.

So my brother
if things this world gives you
Leave longings
that won’t pass away
My precious Lord 
will come and save you
If you kneel to Him and 
humbly pray."
284;I AM BACK IN THE FOLD;;"I was strayng in the 
valley of the shadows of death
I was lost and the light 
was so dim, 
But the good Shepherd
loved me, and He sought me
Till He found me.
Now I am back in the fold again.

CHORUS
I am back in the fold, 
I’m sheltered from the cold,
And I know I’ll forever 
have a friend, 
For the good Shepherd loved us 
And He sought me till He found me, 
Now I’m back in the fold again

I was bending neath my burdens
And my footsteps were sore,
I was bound by the great chain of
sin,
Then the good Shepherd found me
Took me up and unbound me,
Now I’m back in the fold again."
285;I WAS A BEGGAR;;"I was a beggar when 
I found this goldmine
I was a stranger within, 
without a song, 
But now I can sing 
I'm a child of a King
Just wait till you see my new home

CHORUS
Cause I’m as wealthy 
as a King in a palace 
I have riches that’s never been told, 
With Jesus I’m an heir so 
I’m a millionaire 
For I feel like my pockets
Are full of diamonds and gold.

I guess I’ll never have a lot of money
But I’m so rich with Him in my soul
Yes I’d rather have His peace
if it means all the tears 
For I feel like my pockets are full
of diamonds and gold."
286;IN THE SHELTER OF HIS ARMS;;"When my soul was 
disturbed with sorrow,
When my heart was 
burdened with sin, 
Jesus opened His arms 
of mercy, 
And He tenderly took
me in.

CHORUS
There Is peace in the
time of trouble
There is peace in the midst 
of the storm
There is peace though the
world be raging 
In the shelter of His arms.

There are storms that 
we often encounter
Do not fear they will do you
no harm, 
In the storm you will find protection,
In the shelter of His arms.

Though the world 
all around be raging
And it's fears with many
alarms 
But then Jesus said, 
He will keep you
In the shelter of His arms."
287;WHEN I'VE GONE THE LAST MILE;;"If I walk in the pathway 
of duty, 
If I walk till the close of the day 
I shall see the King in His beauty, 
When I’ve gone 
the last mile of the way.

CHORUS
When I've gone the 
last mile of the way
I will rest at the close 
of the day
And I know there are joys
that await me,
When I’ve gone 
the last mile of the way.

If for Christ I proclaim the 
glad story,
If I seek for His sheep gone 
astray
I am sure He will show 
me His glory,
When I’ve gone 
the last mile of the way.

Here the dearest 
of ties we must severe
Tears of sorrows are seen
every day, 
But no sickness only 
singing forever, 
When I’ve gone the last 
mile of the way.

And if here I have earnestly 
striven 
And have tried all His will 
to obey, 
Till I enhance all the rapture 
of heaven, 
When I’ve gone 
the last mile of the way."
288;WHAT HEAVEN MEANS TO ME;;"A country where 
no twilight shadows deepen 
Unending day where night
shall never be,
A city where no storm clouds
ever gather, 
this is just, what heaven 
means to me.

CHORUS
What will It be when 
we get over yonder
And join the throng upon
the glassy sea, 
To join our loved ones and 
crown Christ forever,
Now this is just, what heaven
means to me.

A place where there is no
misunderstanding, 
And from all enemity and strive 
we’re free, 
No unkind words from the heart
are spoken, 
Now this is just what heaven 
means to me.

And when at last we see 
the face of Jesus, 
Before whose image other 
loves all flee,
And when they crown Him 
Lord of all I’ll be there, 
Now this is just,
what heaven means to me."
289;ONE DAY AT A TIME;;"I’m only human, I'm just a woman
Help me believe in what I could be
And all that I am,
Show me the stairway, 
I have to climb
Lord for my sake, 
teach me to take
One day at a time.

CHORUS
One day at a time sweet Jesus, 
That’s all am asking from you,
Just give me the strength 
to do every day
What I have to do, 
Yesterday Is gone sweet Jesus,
And tomorrow may never be mine
Lord help me today, 
show me the way, 
One day at a time.

Do you remember, 
when you walked among men, 
Well Jesus you know, 
as you’re looking below
It’s worse now than then 
Pushing and shoving,
And it's crowding my mind, 
So for my sake, 
Lord teach me to take,
One day at a time."
290;WE ARE PART OF THE FAMILY;;"We are part of the family, 
that’s been born again,
Part of the family, 
whose love knows no end
For Jesus has saved us
and made us His own,
Now we’re part of the family,
that’s on its way home.

CHORUS
And sometimes we laugh together, 
Sometimes we cry;
Sometimes we share together,
heartaches and sighs 
Sometimes we dream together, 
of how It will be 
When we all get to heaven, 
God’s Family.

When a brother's in sorrow, 
we all feel his grief,
When he'spassed through the valley, 
we all feel relieved 
Together in sunshine, 
together in rain, 
Together in victory, 
to His precious name.

And though some go before us, 
we’ll all meet again, 
Just inside the city,
as we enter in, 
There will be no more parting, 
with Jesus we'll  be, 
Together, forever, 
God's Family."
291;I DON'T WONNA BE FREE;;"I don't wonna be free Lord, 
from the task that you gave me,
 I don’t wonna be free Lord, 
from the load I am to share, 
This weight may be heavy,
 but its a privilege to bear it, 
I’m a prisoner of love now 
and I don’t wonna be free.

I’m a man born free, 
I may climb to the highest, 
As a man born free,
I may climb to the depths
But the choice is for me, 
just where I will wander 
But from your guiding hand Lord
I don’t wonna be free."
292;PUT JESUS FIRST;;"Put Jesus first He'll take care of you
He said He’d stand beside me 
Watch over and guide me 
If I would only put Him first in my life
I feel the calm assurance in each task I do
Put Jesus first He'll take care of you.

CHORUS
Put Jesus first in all that you do
Put Jesus first He’ll take care of you
Won’t worry about tomorrow 
With all its pain and sorrow 
Put Jesus first He’ll take care of you.

Let not my heart be troubled 
He said He’d share of my burdens 
If I would only put Him first in my life
Just put your trust in Jesus, 
In all that you do, Put Jesus first, 
He’ll take care of you."
293;EACH DAY I'LL DO A GOLDEN DEED;;"Each day I'll do a golden deed,
By helping those who are in need;
My life on earth is but a span,
And so I will do the best I can.

CHORUS
Life's evening sun, 
Is sinking low, 
A few more days and I must go, 
To meet the deeds
that I have done, 
Where there will be no 
setting sun.

While going down life’s weary road,
I’ll try to lift some traveller’s load,
I'll try to turn the night to day;
Make flowers bloom along the way.

I'll help someone in times of need
And journey on with a rapid speed;
I'll help the weak, the poor, the sick,
Each day I'll lend a helping hand."
294;I AM A STRANGER HERE;;"I am a stranger here, 
within a foreign land, 
My home is far away upon the 
golden strand 
Ambassador to be of realms 
beyond the sea
I am here on business 
for my King.

CHORUS
This Is the message that I bring,
A message angels for would sing,
Oh be ye reconciled, thus saith
my Lord and King
Be ye reconciled to God.

This is the King’s command, 
that all men everywhere
Repent and turn away
from sin seductive snare 
That all who will obey with 
Him shall reign on high
And that’s my business 
for my King.

My home is bright and fair than 
Sharon’s rosy plains 
Eternal life and joy throughout
it's vast domain, 
My sovereign bids me tell
how mortals there may dwell 
And that’s my business 
for my King."
295;WATCH AND PRAY;;"Don’t you want to go with 
Him to glory land?
Don’t you want to be found 
of that heavenly land?
Don’t you want to be with 
Jesus some wonderful day? 
Sharing His glory; 
then watch and pray.

CHORUS
Watch and pray if you would
 enter in, 
Watch and pray that you be free 
from sin 
Our Lord is coming to catch 
His bride away
 If you want to go with Him
 Then watch and pray,

Now you better be repenting 
from all your sins
Ask the Holy Spirit to
dwell within
Live a holy life, from day to day
 Waiting for His coming, 
then watch and pray."
296;DAY OF JUDGMENT;;"Day of judgment may be nearing
What a morning that will be,
There will be safety then in Jesus,
Rock of Ages cleft for me.

CHORUS
Oh my loving brother
when the world's on fire, 
Don’t you want God’s bosom 
to be your pillow, 
Hide me ever,
 in the Rock of Ages, 
Rock of Ages cleft for me.

When the dawning of that morning
Breaks in fury on the world,
Rocks and mountains, streets and
valleys
In confusion will be hurled.

Sinners trembling, saints rejoicing
Each departing to his place,
All the ransomed Christ will
gather,
He has saved them by His grace."
297;COME DRINK AT THE WELL OF MERCY;;"Most of my life I’ve been filled 
with despair
Everything seems to slip by me 
Fear held my heart and death 
ruled my soul
Then I drank at the well of mercy

CHORUS
The author of life gave me strength
to go on 
He opened my eyes 
turned the darkness to dawn
And now there Is sunshine 
and love in my heart 
Something Inside me Is singing 
The thirst in my soul 
now Is quenched every day 
As I drink at the well of His mercy.

Now if you are thirsty 
come drink at this well
You will never thirst again 
like the woman at the well 
Jesus spoke to that day, 
Said, come drink at the 
well of Mercy."
298;I SETTLED IT LONG AGO;;"There was a time on earth, 
when in the books of heaven
An old account was standing
for Sins yet unforgiven 
My name was at the top, 
with many things below
I Went to the Keeper 
and I settled long ago

CHORUS
Long ago (down on my knees)
Long ago (I settled it all)
Yes the old account was settled
long ago Hallelujah
And the record is clear today, 
for He washed my sins away 
When the old account 
was settled long ago.

The old account was large 
and growing every day 
For I was always sinning 
and I never tried to pray, 
But when I looked ahead 
and saw such pain and woe 
I said that I would settle, 
and I settled long ago.

When at the judgment seat, 
I stand before my King
And there the Books will open, 
He cannot find a thing,
Then will my heart be glad,
and tears of joy will flow 
Because I had it settled, 
and I settled long ago.

When in that happy home, 
my Saviour’s home above, 
I’ll sing redemption story, 
and praise Him for His love;
I’ll not forget that Book, 
with pages white as snow
Because I came and settled, 
when I settled long ago.

Oh, sinners seek ye the Lord, 
repent of all your sins,
For this He has commanded
if you should enter in,
And then if you should live, 
a thousand years here below 
You’ll never regret it,
why you settled long ago."
299;IT'S WONDERFUL TO KNOW;;"It's so wonderful to know
there’s a place where
you can go
When you are all burdened down
With the cares of this world,
When it seems there’s nothing real,
That’s the time when you should
kneel
Pray to God up in heaven, 
and tell Him how you feel.

CHORUS
It’s so wonderful to know that 
He Is real
Living in my soul His love I can feel
With each step that I take
I know am nearer home 
I know my trials will be over after a while.


When the trumpet of God shall sound 
oh where will you be found? 
Will your anchor be in Jesus
And will your heart be free from sin?
On that bright and cloudless morning
With the saints I want to rise 
When the roll is called up yonder,
 I’ll meet Him in the air."
300;THANK GOD I AM FREE;;"CHORUS
Thank God I am free, free, free
From this world of sin,
Washed In the blood of Jesus,
I’ve been born again,
Hallelujah, I am saved, saved,
Saved by His wonderful grace,
I’m so glad that I found out
He would bring me out and
show me the way.

For a long time I travelled, 
down a long lonely road, 
My heart was so heavy
with sin and sunk low, 
But when I heard about Jesus, 
what a wonderful hour,
I’m so glad that I found out, 
He would bring me out and show 
me the way.

Like a bird out of prison 
that’s taken it's flight, 
Like a blind man that God gave back 
his sight
Like a poor wretched beggar 
that’s found fortune and fame 
I’m so glad that I found out, 
He would bring me out and show me
 the way."
301;LORD HELP ME RUN IN THE RACE;;"CHORUS
Lord help me run in the race,
Help me not bring you disgrace,
But let me rise on wings of faith,
Until the day I’ll see your face.

Sometimes the way down here
gets rough,
When I look at Satan’s plans,
It’s then I rise on wings of faith,
For in God’s word I am safe.

Now we can see the end is near,
The coming of the Lord is nigh,
Oh sinner where will you stand
When the time down here will end?"
302;WITHOUT A DOUBT I AM SAVED;;"Once I served the Lord 
only with my lips
And I put all my trust
 in my church membership
And in my soul I was lost, 
earnestly I prayed
Till I knew without a doubt I’m Saved

CHORUS
Without a doubt I’m saved
I have been born again
Washed In calvary’s flow pure
and white within.
Though I once was lost 
and in sins chains enslaved 
But now I know 
without a doubt I’m saved.

There is a deep settled peace 
in my happy soul
My life has an aim 
heaven is my goal
And the world’s gathering storms 
Cannot make me afraid 
And now I know 
without a doubt I’m saved."
303;ABOVE ALL;;"Above all powers above all Kings
Above all nature and
all created things
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
You were here before the world began.
Above all kingdom above all thrones
Above all wonders  the world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
There’s no way to measure what you’re worth.

CHORUS
Crucified laid behind the stone
You lived to die rejected and alone
Like a rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall and thought of me 
Above all.


Above all powers above all Kings
Above all nature and all created things
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
You were here before the world began.
Above all kingdom above all thrones
Above all wonders the world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
There’s no way to measure what you’re worth."
304;THERE HAVE BEEN KINGS;;"There have been kings 
with riches untold
They have worn crowns 
of diamonds and gold 
But there was a King 
who was better than them all 
And the crown that He wore
 was a crown of thorns.

CHORUS
A crown of thorns 
was placed upon His head
He hang on the cross 
until He was dead
The sky was dark 
with the raging storms 
When they crowned the King of Kings
With a crown of thorns.

They were so cruel 
to my Saviour and King
He died for our sins, 
salvation to bring
He is the King of Kings, 
the greatest ever born 
And the crown that He wore 
was a crown of thorns."
305;NOW I KNOW THAT HE IS MINE;;"chorus
Now I know that He Is mine 
and am His forever 
He Is leading me along the way 
He’ll be holding to my hand 
When I cross death’s river, 
He will take the sting of death away.

Tis so sweet to know, 
I have Jesus with me
He is keeping me from sin 
and from strife
He delivers me from condemnation 
Now I have eternal life.

Now I’m walking day by day
With my wondrous Saviour
He is lighting every step of the way
And His love so real as He walks
besides me
And His peace will be my stay."
306;GOD KNOWS MY HEART IS PURE;;"CHORUS
God knows my heart 
Is pure
And I strive to do some good 
Though temptations
are so hard to overcome
I'll rejoice on that day when I'll hear 
my Saviour say 
Lay your burdens down my child, 
welcome home

I'm so troubled and so weary 
that I don’t know what to do 
But the Lord said that He’d see 
me through
All the road that I have travelled
has been long and so dark 
But the Lord knows what is in my heart.

Oh, Satan has a power
to tempt a sinner man
Till he’s caught up in a snare 
he can’t undo
If you hear the gentle whisper 
of the Master’s voice above
 I know that the Lord 
will see you through."
307;IS HE SATISFIED WITH ME?;;"Do you ever search your heart, 
as you watch the day depart?
Is there something way down 
deep you're trying to hide?
If this day should be the end 
and eternity begins, 
When the Book is open wide, 
would the Lord be satisfied?

CHORUS
Is He satisfied, is He satisfied?
is He satisfied with me? 
Have I done my best, 
have I stood the test?
ls He satisfied with me.

Feeble is the lamb of fame, 
By which men inscribe their name 
On the walls of time 
for other men to see,
Though they boast of wealth and praise,
None can help them in the end 
When the angels hear my plea, 
Would the Lord be satisfied?


When my Lord shall come again, 
When He walks and talks with men 
What if every friend 
He had were just like me
Would He find a welcome heart 
or Would He go away in tears? 
Am I all that I should be, 
is He satisfied with me?"
308;I HAVE GOT A MANSION;;"I’m satisfied with 
just a cottage below,
A little silver and a little gold, 
But in that city, where the 
ransomed will shine 
I’ll want a gold one, 
that’s silvery lined.

CHORUS
I've got a mansion, just over 
the hill top 
In that bright land where 
we’ll never grow old 
But some day yonder 
we’ll never more wander 
But walk the streets that 
are as pure as gold.

Though often tempted, 
tormented and tested, 
And like the prophet, 
my pillow a stone
And though I find here no 
permanent dwelling 
I know He’ll give me 
a mansion of my own.

Don’t think me poor 
and deserted or lonely, 
I am not discouraged, 
I’m heavenly bound
I’m just a pilgrim in search of a city
I know He’ll give me 
a mansion of my own."
309;THE GREAT SPECKLED BIRD;;"What a beautiful thought I am
thinking,
Concerning the great speckled bird,
Remember her name is recorded,
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

All the other birds are flocking
around her
And she is not loved by this world
But the great speckled bird in the
Bible
Represents the great Church of
God.

All the other birds it seems
are against her
They envy her glory and fame, 
They are against her because 
she is chosen
And has never denied His dear name.

She is spreading 
her wings for a journey
That she’s going to make by and by 
When the great trumpet 
sounds in the morning
She will meet her dear Lord in the sky.

In the presence of all the others
With a song never heard before
She will use and be gone in a
moment
Till the great tribulation is over.

Oh I am glad I’ve learnt of a meeting, 
Oh I am glad that my name’s
 in the Book 
For I want to be one never failing 
On the face of my Saviour to look.

When He comes descending 
from heaven, 
On the clouds as He rides on His way,
 I’ll be joyfully carried to meet Him 
On the wings of that great speckled bird.

She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation Is over."
310;AS IT WAS SO SHALL IT BE;;"It’s been said we’re living in a 
modern Sodom
Just like what the Bible says it would be
Things back as it started in the Bible

CHORUS
As it was, so shall it be.
As It was, so shall it be
The wickedness of men has
got to reign
So we know that something
Is about to happen
As it was, so shall it be.

In Malachi 4 
God gave us the promise,
And He came and fulfilled
it in this time, 
In the midst of a Christ rejecting nation 
God called His bride, 
so shall it be.

In Noah’s day just before 
the floods came, 
The morals of men had become 
so bad we know, 
Look around today in this land
we’re living, 
As it was, so shall it be."
311;JESUS KEEP ME TRUE TO THEE;;"When I was bound with chains of sin, 
And I was down cast with sorrows 
and shame;
There was no-one, Oh not even one, 
To stand by me except Christ who died.

CHORUS
Oh loving Jesus keep me true to Thee
And always ready to do Thy will
To serve Thee till In the grave I’m laid, 
Hallelujah my tongue sings no more.

Oh loving Jesus we thank you
Lord,
For Thy message to this our day,
For if it were not for your amazing
grace,
We don’t know, where we could be
Dear Lord.

My Lord, my whole life to Thee I
yield,
My Lord, my heart for Thee be swift
My Lord my ways to Thee I resign
And my lips confess it to the world.

There was no way out, but for Thy death, 
To make me righteous
 before Thee oh Lord, 
To fulfil that wondrous plan of salvation, 
For me that blessed home to see."
312;THE OLD SHIP OF ZION;;"There is a ship called 
the old ship of Zion
And it’s passing this way 
just one more time,
And I got my ticket waiting 
for the rapture,
And my heart is longing for
that final day.

CHORUS
The old ship of Zion will soon 
be coming in
Then I shall step upon it 
and leave this world of sin, 
I’ll be changed in a moment 
in a twinkling of an eye
And I’ll go sailing through the sky
For the ship of Zion will soon be coming in.
(Yes the ship of Zion will Soon be coming In)

Not long ago, a prophet came on to earth
And he brought us ‘Thus says the Lord'
And he said you better get your ticket ready, 
For without the token you can’t get on board."
313;I'VE HEARD THE EAGLE CALL;;"I'm glad I've heard the eagle 
call today, 
It put me on that straight and 
narrow way
And now it makes me happy to say,
That I’ve heard that eagle call today.

I'm glad I’ve heard the eagle call
today, 
Malachi 4 and 5 is the way, 
No matter what people do
And no matter what people say, 
I’m glad I’ve heard the eagle call today.

This eagle prophet brought a
special message
He gave us life by giving us the
Word,
The true interpretation of the hour
Oh friends I’ve heard the eagle call.

This eagle came flying over my way 
Then all at once I recognized my day
And it’s message then became my aim 
For my heart received the eagle call."
314;SURELY, I WILL;;"If working and praying 
have any reward
Then surely some morning 
I’ll meet my Dear Lord, 
With God as my pilot, 
I'll climb the high ill, 
And if anyone makes it all the way Lord,
Surely I will.


CHORUS
Surely I will, surely I will 
If anyone makes it all the way Lord,
Surely I will,
On top of mount Zion way up on the hill
If anyone makes it all the way Lord,
Surely I will.

With faith as my weapon, 
and hope as my stay
Though baffles are all over, am well
on my way.
Though I may grow weary, 
am travelling still 
And if anyone makes it 
all the way Lord, Surely I will."
315;THE TOKEN TODAY;;"The Lord spoke to Moses 
and told him to say, 
To the children of Israel, 
in Goshen that day, Slay the lamb, 
take the blood, 
strike the post at the door, 
For I'll pass through Egypt this night
And smite all the first borns.

CHORUS
Let the death angel pass,
God’s Bride’s safe at last,
In the Token He gave
That we could be saved
Oh Hallelujah, and glory to
God
The Blood’s been applied, His
spirit abides,
Let the death angel pass.

The sweet Holy Spirit 
is the token today
And all that are under it, 
God said they’d be saved
Outside of this Token, 
the lost would be bound
If you want your loved ones saved,
 Let’s get them in now."
316;STAND BY ME JESUS;;"In the midst of faults and failures, 
stand by me, 
In the midst of faults and failures, 
stand by me
When I try to do my best
 and my friends misunderstand
 Thou who knowest all about me 
stand by me.

CHORUS
Stand by me, stand by me,
Loving Jesus stand by me
I have no strength nor power
of my own
Loving Jesus stand by me.

In the midst of tribulations, 
stand by me, 
In the midst of tribulations 
stand by me, 
When this world is tossing me 
like a ship upon the sea, 
Thou who rulest winds and waters 
stand by me.

In the midst of pain and sorrows, 
stand by me, 
In the midst of pain and sorrows 
stand by me
When my body is full of pain 
and my heart is full of troubles 
Thou who healeth my diseases, 
stand by me."
317;JESUS REMEMBERED ME;;"I was alone and drifting 
on the lonely sea of sin, 
Nothing but darkness, 
no sunshine within, 
I lifted up my eyes to the Lord 
in the sky,
 Glory to God He remembered me.

CHORUS
Jesus remembered me, 
oh glory, glory,
 And so He set me free, 
Once I was blind
 but now I can see
Glory to God He remembered me.

As He taught His disciples 
by the sea of Galilee
He said He’d remember a mortal 
like me
I asked for His forgiveness down 
on my knees
Glory to God He remembered me.

Now the dawn is breaking 
I am happy and free 
No more sorrows and troubles 
for me I’m going home in glory 
My Saviour to see 
Glory to God He remembered me."
318;THE MAN I'M LOOKING FOR;;"If you see a man in sandals, 
please send Him down my way 
It might be my Master, 
He’s coming back some day, 
If you see a man in white, 
that’s like no one you’ve seen before 
Won’t you let me know, 
that’s the man I’m looking for.

CHORUS
And if you can remember,
Ask Him what’s His name,
And if He tells you Jesus,
Say we’re glad you came
Tell Him you know
someoneThat still calls
Him Lord
Then send Him on to me, 
That’s the man I’m looking for.

If you see a man that shines with 
a love flow on His face; 
Turn Him down my street, 
so He can find my place, 
And if His hands are scarred, 
please don’t shut the door 
Just send Him on to me, 
that’s the man I’m looking for."
319;THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED WAY;;"I am on the gospel highway
Pressing forward to the goal
Where for me a rest remaineth
In the home-land of the soul,
Every hour I’m moving onward
Not a moment to delay
I am going home to glory
In the good old fashioned-way.

CHORUS
{In the good old fashioned-way
In the good old fashioned-way
I am going home to glory
In the good old fashioned-way} X2 

From the snares of sinful pleasure
Here my feet are always free
Tho’ the way may be called narrow
It is wide enough for me,
It was wide enough for Daniel
And for David in his day
I am glad that I can follow
In the good old fashioned-way.

Many friends have gone before me
They have laid their armour down
With the pilgrims and the martyrs
Have obtained a robe and crown
On this road they fought their
battles
Shouting vict’ry day by day
I shall overcome and join them
In the good old fashioned-way.

Just a few more steps to follow
Just a few more days to roam
But the way grows more delightful
As I’m drawing nearer home
When the storms of life are over
And the clouds have rolled away
I shall find the gates of heaven 
In the good old fashioned-way."
320;AM SINGING FOR MY LORD;;"Am singing for my Lord, 
everywhere I go
Singing of His wondrous love that
the world may know,
How He saved a wretch like me by
His death at calvary
Am singing for my Lord, everywhere
I go.

Am singing for the lost just 
because I know 
Jesus Christ whose precious blood 
washes white as snow 
If my song to Him can bring one lost 
soul I'll gladly sing, 
Am singing for my Lord 
everywhere I go.

Am singing for the saints, 
as they journey home
Soon they’ll reach that better land 
never more to roam 
Soon I’ll join with them and sing, 
praises to my God and King
 Am singing for my Lord, 
everywhere I go.

Am singing though sometimes, 
heavy with the load 
For this world is not my friend 
to the grace of God
Yet I’ll sing the whole day long, 
praises to my God and King 
Am singing for my Lord, 
everywhere I go."
321;I WILL MAKE IT AFTER ALL;;"Burdens here are sometimes many, 
And often times my feet grow weary
Till it seems I almost stumble and fall
But the tender hand that leads me, 
Is the one that keeps me steady 
And I know that I will make it, 
after all.

CHORUS
After all this life is over 
And my burdens have been lifted
And I stand upon the mountain 
top so tall 
Looking over In that city 
That the Saviour is preparing
Gives me faith that I will make it, 
after all.

By myself I cannot make it, 
But I know He’s there to help me
He will hear my prayer if on Him 
I will call
Keep on trusting and believing, 
Are the words I hear Him whisper
Just a few more days to labour, 
after all."
322;WHEN I'M TOSSED ON LIFE’S SEA;;"When am tossed on life’s sea, 
and the waves cover me 
And the dark clouds won’t let 
the sun shine through 
Then a voice seems to say, 
child there will be a brighter day 
Don’t allow the clouds to hide 
sweet heavens view.

CHORUS
(Cos you've got) one more valley 
One more hill
(May be) one more trial, 
one more tear
One more heavy life’s load 
May be one more mile to go 
You can lay down your heavy load
When you get home.

Don’t let Satan see your tears
Learn to smile through your fears
Hold your head up high and give
the world a smile
You must be faithful all the way
It will be worth it all some day
For it’s going to be over, after a while."
323;TAKE UP THY CROSS, FOLLOW ME;;"I journeyed one day along 
a country road
And there a stranger journeyed too
Bent low beneath the burden of
His load
It was a cross, a cross I knew.

CHORUS
Take up Thy cross and follow me, 
follow me
I hear the blessed Saviour's call
How can I make a lesser
sacrifice
When Jesus gave His all.

I cried Lord Jesus 
and He spoke my name
I saw His hands all bruised 
and scarred
I tried to kiss away the 
marks of shame
The shame for me that He had 
borne.

Thy cross I’ll carry till 
the crown appears
The way I journey soon will end 
When God Himself shall wipe all tears
And hold sweet fellowship 
with friends."
324;WHERE THE SOUL NEVER DIES;;"To Canaan’s land, I’m on my way
Where the soul never dies
My darkest night will turn to day,
Where the soul (of man) never
dies.

CHORUS
No sad farewells  
No tear dimmed eyes 
Where all Is love
(where all Is peace, and joy and love)
 And the soul (of man) never dies 

The rose is blooming there for me 
Where the soul (of man) 
never dies
And I will spend eternity 
Where the soul (of man) 
never dies.

A love-light beams across
 the foam
Where the soul (of man) 
never dies
It shines to light the shores 
of home
Where the soul (of man) 
never dies.

My life will end in deathless 
sleep 
Where the soul (of man) 
never dies
And everlasting joys I’ll reap 
Where the soul (of man) 
never dies.

I’m on my way to that fair land 
Where the soul (of man) 
never dies
Where there will be no parting hand
And the soul (of man) 
never dies."
325;BACK IN EDEN;;"Wretched and poor, I once was living, 
Imprisoned by Satan imprisoned 
by death, 
But Christ my Saviour, came down from 
glory 
And changed my poor wretched soul
And now I am free.

CHORUS
Back In Eden, I’ll be free from
all sin
I’ll be free from all evil
I’ll be free from all fears


Tempted and tried 
each moment of life
All these have not moved me they 
cannot change me
 When in the Spirit I walk 
all day long
And lean on my Saviour 
who conquered the grave.

Jesus my Lord, 
died long to save you, 
And yet in sin you toil each 
moment of your Life. 
You will answer for it, 
beyond the river, 
When you meet your Maker 
the Spirit you grieve.

Saints and angels 
above are singing
They’re waiting for us 
beyond the river
And when we’re raised, 
we’ll join the Lord’s band
And sing to our Saviour, 
Hallelujah, Amen!

Hallelujah Amen!
Hallelujah Amen!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!"
326;THE HOLY HILLS OF HEAVEN;;"The Holy hills of heaven call me, 
To mansions bright across the sea,
Where loved ones wait 
and crowns are given,
And the hills of home 
keep calling me.

CHORUS
This house of flesh is but a prison, 
Bars of bones hold my soul 
But the doors of clay 
One day will burst wide open 
When the angel sets my spirit free
I'll take my flight, 
 like a mighty eagle
For the hills of home keep 
calling me.

I see loved ones over yonder,
Their tears are gone and their 
 hearts are free
And from the throne, my Saviour
 beckons
And the hills of home keep calling
me."
327;THERE IS A LAND OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS;;"I know there is a land 
of beautiful flowers, 
Where we will meet again 
when life is o’er
Where we will while away
 the endless hours
On heavens bright eternal 
shore.

The prettiest beds of flowers
will be blooming
In the prettiest dream town 
I shall ever behold
And the prettiest songs 
with the angels well be singing 
By the prettiest mansion 
made of purest gold.

The prettiest robes and crowns 
we will all be wearing
In the beautiful square beyond 
this world of trials
Where the tree of life for us is 
awaiting
By the prettiest mansion 
made of purest gold."
328;HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT;;"CHORUS
He didn't have to do it, 
thank God He did
He didn’t have to love me, 
thank God He did 
He didn’t have to save me, 
thank God He did
 Am so glad He did.

I was an outcast so far from home, 
No one to love me hope 
was almost gone,
 Then I felt the power of Jesus 
touch my life 
Am so glad He did.

When I was sick in body, 
the doctor shook his head, 
There is no hope for you 
the future is dark he said, 
Then I felt the power of 
God’s mighty hand,
 Am so glad He did."
329;I MEAN TO GO RIGHT ON;;"I mean to go right on 
until the crown is worn
I mean to fight the fight of faith, 
Till life on earth is done; 
I’ll never more turn back, 
defeat I shall not know, 
For God will give me victory 
if onward I will go 
Am going On:

CHORUS
Am going on, am going on 
Until the final triumph 
Am going on, am going on 
Until the final triumph 
am going yes am going on

Should opposition come 
should foes obstruct my way 
Should persecutions fires 
be as in the ancient days 
With Jesus by my side, 
His peace within my soul, 
No matter if the battle is hot,
I mean to reach the goal 
Am going on

I see a shining crown 
awaiting over there
I see a mansion well 
prepared and decked with beauties 
rare 
Should that which intervenes 
deprive me of my right 
May I go on until I reach 
the city of the Lord, 
Am going on

Then forward let us go 
our hearts with love aflame
Our showy banner borne aloft 
inscribed with Jesus Name 
The hosts of evil flee, 
And heavens open gate
Invites me to hasten
where eternal glory waits 
Am going on"
330;HARVEST TIME;;"The leaves are falling, 
harvest time is past, 
So is it in the Spirit, 
the end is coming fast, 
The time will soon be here 
when Jesus Christ shall come,
So lift up your head 
your redemption is drawing nigh.

CHORUS
And It will be too late my brother 
then to pray, 
Don’t put off till tomorrow what
you can do today, 
For you’ll find yourself In judgment 
and you’ll have to pay, 
For the opportunity that has come 
your way.

Now it’s gleaning time the reapers
are in the field,
To find the last of the seed 
the others will not yield,
And the glory of God will shine for it's
evening time
And the  true Bride of Christ 
will soon fall into line."
331;IT ONLY TAKES A SPARK;;"It will only takes a spark 
to get the fire burning
And soon all those around 
can warm up to its glowing
That’s how it is with God’s love
Once you’ve experienced it,
You spread His love, to every one
You want to pass it on.

What a wondrous time is spring
When all the trees are budding,
The birds begin to sing
The flowers start their blooming
That’s how it is with God’s love
Once you’ve experienced it,
You want to sing it’s fresh like spring
You want to pass it on.

I wish for you my friends
This happiness that I’ve found
You can depend on Him
It matters not where you are bound
I’ll shout it on the mountain tops
I want the world to know
The Lord of love has come to me
I want to pass it on."
332;NEARING THE SHORE;;"Glorious peace 
that never shall cease, 
Heartaches can’t enter, 
those beautiful streets, 
No pain, no woe, no rich, no poor, 
It’s glorious to know 
that we’re nearing the shore.

CHORUS
We're nearing the shore, 
we’re nearing the shore,
Troubles soon will be over 
we’ll suffer no more,
Trials all past, it’s victory at last,
Oh It is wonderful to 
be nearing the shore.

We’ll see the Lighthouse
 Jesus Divine, 
He will say welcome, 
children of mine, 
Come in and rest, this land possess, 
Oh it is wonderful 
to be nearing the shore."
333;OH GRACIOUS JESUS;;"Hold me so close to Thee 
and show me Thy way, 
That I may walk in the light 
of your goodness all of my day, 
Forgive me of sin my Lord, 
have mercy on me
Thank you Lord, 
that’s not my sin but 
my heart that you see.

CHORUS
Oh Gracious Jesus, make me so small, 
In worldly matters, make me not at all, 
But in Thy Spirit make oh so tall, 
Oh Gracious Jesus, Lord of all.

Oft in my loneliness, 
when I cried out to Thee
You stood in the midst of my heart, 
and you warmed me so tenderly,
Now I know You once again, 
now I long for that day, 
When I shall hear the call of Your 
Voice and you’ll take me away."
334;DID YOU THINK TO PRAY;;"E're you left your room 
this morning, 
Did you think to pray, 
In the Name of Christ our Saviour, 
Did you ask for loving
favour as a shield today.

CHORUS
Oh how praying rests the weary, 
Prayer will change the night today, 
So when life seems dark and dreary, 
Don't forget to pray.

When you met with great temptation, 
Did you think to pray, 
By His dying love and merit
Did you claim the Holy Spirit 
as your guide and stay.

When your heart was filled with anger
Did you think to pray,
Did you plead for grace my brother
That you might forgive another
Who has crossed your way."
335;CHILD OF THE KING;;"Once I was clothed 
in the rags of my sin, 
Wretched and poor, 
lost and lonely within, 
But with wondrous compassion 
the King of all kings, 
In pity and love took me under 
His wings.

CHORUS
Oh yes, oh yes, I'm a child 
of the King, 
His Royal Blood 
now flows In my veins, 
And I who was wretched 
and poor now can sing, 
Praise God, praise God, 
I’m a child of the King.

Now I’m a child 
with a Heavenly home,
My Heavenly Father 
hath made me His Own,
And I’m cleansed by His Blood 
and I’m clothed in
His love,
And someday I’ll sing with the
angels above."
336;LAST MILE OF THE WAY;;"If I walk in the pathway 
of duty, 
If I work till the close of the day, 
I shall see the great King 
in His beauty, 
When I’ve gone 
the last mile of the way.

CHORUS
When I've gone 
the last mile of the way, 
I will rest at the close of the day, 
And I know there are joys 
that await me, 
When I’ve gone 
the last mile of the way.

Here the dearest of ties 
we must sever, 
Tears of sorrows are seen 
every day,
But no sickness, no sighing for ever, 
When I’ve gone 
the last mile of the way.

And if here I have earnestly 
striven, 
And have tried all His will to obey, 
Twill enhance all the rapture 
of heaven, 
When I’ve gone 
the last mile of the way."
337;I WAS THERE;;"Before the moon or the sun, 
or the time had begun, 
Before that God ever said 
Let there be Light, 
Before there was a grain of sand, 
I was in the Master’s plan, 
I was there, hallelujah, 
I was there.

Before this earth did appear, 
or there was an atmosphere, 
Before there ever was a star 
to grace the sky, 
When the sons of God did sing,
praise and Glory to the King 
I was there, 
hallelujah I was there.

When my Saviour gave His life, 
shed His Blood and paid the price, 
When mountains shook and the veil 
was rent in twain, 
When the spear did pierce His side, 
He was travailing for His Bride, 
I was there, hallelujah, I was there.

Now as I walk this earthly race 
My faith is anchored in my God 
And I'll not fear as through this valley 
I must cross 
Christ is living in my heart 
His Word has said He will not depart 
And He is there, 
hallelujah, He is there.

Till the trump of God should sound, 
Calling me to higher realms, 
My eyes are fixed on Jesus Christ 
My Lord and King, 
Soon He’ll call His waiting Bride, 
to be ever at His side, 
Then I’ll be there, 
Oh hallelujah, I’ll be there."
338;DONT LOSE YOUR VISION;;"As you travel along this pilgrim 
Way 
There are heartaches and burdens 
to bear, 
But with a vision of Jesus and heaven
 in view 
Your cross is much lighter to bear.

CHORUS
Don't lose your vision of Jesus, 
Keep your eyes ever on Him, 
Many Friends and dear loved ones 
have lost their way, 
They have lost their vision of Him.

I remember the time, 
I remember the place, 
Where Jesus so sweetly came in, 
How He took all my burdens 
I carried so long, 
When I first caught a vision of Him."
339;SEVEN STARS;;"Seven stars in the hand of Jesus,
Were the messengers to each age,
Now the seventh star 
has come and gone,
And here is what he’s seen.

CHORUS
He's seen the Bride come walking, 
The gowns were white as snow, 
In their hearts there was 
the Master’s love, 
And their faces there was a glow.

By faith we’ll be in that number,
The one’s He chose for His Bride,
Though we fail each day in this
world below,
Some day we'll be by His side."
340;THE GREATEST MORNING EVER;;"I woke up this morning, 
wondering could this be the day, 
When those who beneath us are resting,
Would arise to bring on that new day,
Then my heart begins to beat for joy,
Knowing what day that will be
For the Bride will go to meet Jesus,
The Bridegroom she so longs to see.

CHORUS
It will be the greatest morning ever, 
When our loved ones again we behold, 
This time we’ll meet, 
never to part, 
With Jesus we’ll always be.

The signs and times, are telling us,
That this is the day He'll return,
There’re wars and earthquakes
everywhere,
Hearts failing for the trouble they see,
And the prophet has cried out again,
Oh people return back to God,
For Jesus is coming for a bride,
Whose garments are spotless and
white."
341;GOD WALKS THE DARK HILLS;;"God walks the dark hills,
The ways, the by-ways
He walks on the billows of life’s
troubled sea
He walks in the cold, dark nights,
The shadows, the mid-nights
God walks the dark hills
Just to guide you and me.

CHORUS
God walks the dark hills
To guide my footstep.
He walks everyday,
By night and by day,
He walks in silence,
All down the highway 
God walks the dark hills, 
To show me the way.

Then God walks in the storms,
The rain and the sunshine
He walks on the billows 
or through Glimmering lights
Helps us walk up the 
mountain so High
Cross our rivers through valleys 
God walks the dark hills, 
Cos He loves you and me."
342;HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR CALVARY;;"Just suppose God searched 
through Heaven, 
He couldn’t find one willing to be, 
The supreme sacrifice 
that was needed, 
To buy eternal life for you and me.

CHORUS
Had it not been for a place
called Mount Calvary, 
And had it not been for the
 old rugged cross, 
Had it not been for a man 
called Jesus, 
Then forever my soul would be lost.

Oh Am so glad He was willing to
drink that bitter cup
Although He prayed Father 
let it pass from me, 
And am so glad He never 
called Heaven’s angels.
From my hands pull these nails 
that torment me."
343;JESUS IS COMING BACK AGAIN;;"Jesus died on the cross 
at Calvary, 
He shed His own Blood 
for you and for me, 
But He arose again 
on that Easter morn, 
So repent everyone 
and in Christ be reborn.

CHORUS
Jesus Is coming back to earth again, 
He’s coming for His Bride 
to take them up with Him, 
Jesus is coming back to earth again, 
As soon as the last 
one has entered therein.

The end-time Message came 
forth a while ago, 
He brought back the Word 
and things we ought to know, 
In Malachi 4 it tells of a 
prophet to come, 
He came and delivered the 
Word to everyone."
344;I'M GOING THAT WAY;;"I've heard of a land 
of joy and peace and 
wonderful light,
A beautiful place of mansions 
fair and skies ever bright, 
I know I'll be near 
the Saviour dear, for ever to stay,
And having been saved 
by grace divine, 
I’m going that way.

CHORUS
I'm going that way, 
I’m going that way, 
And Jesus the Sariour
I adore Is with me each day, 
I’m clinging to Him and 
never to stray, 
Just singing His praises 
all day long, 
I’m going that way.

The glorious news I'll tell 
and sing as onward I go, 
For those who’re still astray in sin, 
my Saviour may know, 
I want them to sing His praises 
above some beautiful day, 
Oh glory to Him who died for me 
Im going that way.

I know I shall meet Him 
at the gate, 
when trials are past, 
I know I shall meet Him face to face, 
in glory at last, 
And now I believe 
that when we meet, 
well done He’ll say, 
For trusting His souls redeeming
Blood, 
I’m going that way."
345;GOD'S WORD IS TRUE;;"Listen my friend 
to these words of mine, 
There is an answer to every 
problem you’ll find, 
They’re found in the Bible 
the true Word of God, 
In there is Eternal Life 
to all that believe,

CHORUS
God's Word Is true, 
He will never fail you, 
If you’ll walk in the Light, 
He’ll see you through, 
Like all of God’s prophets 
that before us have been, 
This prophets fulfilled 
the words that were written 
of them.

There is a promise
 to us in this day,
That a mighty prophet is to come
our way,
And we find this promise in
Malachi 4,
And we must believe it 
so that God can restore."
346;SIGNS OF THE TIME;;"Years of time have come and gone 
since I first heard it told, 
That Jesus would come  
to earth again
And if back then it seemed so real
How much more He has revealed 
How much closer 
His coming is today.

CHORUS
Signs of the times are everywhere, 
And there’s a brand new feeling 
in the air, 
So keep your eyes upon 
the eastern sky, 
Lift up your heads 
Your redemption draweth nigh.

Wars and strife on every hand 
and violence fills our land, 
And still some people they say 
He won't come again, 
Oh but the Word of God is true 
He’s redeemed His chosen few, 
He's our hope 
He'll be waiting at the end"
347;WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN YOUR DAY;;"Men will always preach the
promises of yesterday,
Of a baby to be born in
Bethlehem,
They tell of the ark 
and of Noah,
And they marvel at the faith of
Abraham.

We all know of the story of Jonah, 
And of Daniel and the lions
we often tell,
We know of the promise that 
saved them, 
But do you know the promise 
for your day as well?

CHORUS
But what has God done in your day, 
Are you looking to the Word 
for yesterday?
There’s a promise to be fulfilled 
In every age, 
Oh what has God done In you day?

Do you know there’s a promise 
for our time, 
Have you heard of Malachi 4? 
For behold I will send you Elijah, 
Before the great and dreadful 
day of the Lord."
348;BECAUSE HE LIVES;;"The Son of God, they called Him
Jesus,
He came to save, heal and forgive,
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove
my Saviour lives.

CHORUS
Because He lives I can face tomorrow, 
Because He lives all fear is gone, 
Because I know He holds the future, 
And life Is worth, the living just
because He lives.

How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
And feel the pride and joy he gives;
But greater still the calm assurance:
This child can face uncertain days 
because He Lives!

The world today has nailed my Jesus, 
Upon a cross, a cross of shame, 
This second death has given victory,
The Bride now knows 
He had to die that she could live.

I know today that He is living,
The Word of God is manifest,
The Bride of Christ has seen His
Body,
The opening up of the Seven
Seals now proves He lives.

Now soon one day, 
I’ll cross that river, I’ll conquer death 
the grave and man, 
And as His shame gives me the victory.
I’ll shout through eternity
because He lives."
349;I'LL SEE YOU IN THE RAPTURE;;"CHORUS
I’ll see you In the Rapture, 
I'll see you In the Rapture, 
I'll see you at that meeting in the air
There with our Blessed Saviour, 
We’ll live and reign forever, 
I’ll see you In the Rapture 
some sweet day.

If we never meet again,
On this earth my precious friend,
If to God you have been true,
And you’ve lived above all sin;
Then for us there’ll be a meeting;
And a hallelujah greeting;
I’ll see you in the Rapture some
sweet day.

To my loved ones let me say,
That there’ll surely come a day,
When our Lord shall come again,
To take His Bride away,
So get ready now to meet Him,
And with hallelujahs greet Him,
I’ll see you in the Rapture some
sweet day."
350;JUST ANY DAY NOW;;"Each time I stop to take 
the time to look around me,
 I see the signs of His 
appearing everywhere, 
The things He said would 
come to pass are now before us,
 And I feel a strange excitement 
in the air.

CHORUS
Just any day now 
my Lord is coming, 
He’ll be returning for you and me,
 And I’ll be watching, 
and I’ll be waiting, 
Just any day now, His face I’ll see.

There’s this longing in my heart 
for His appearing, 
I’ll gladly leave behind trials 
here below, 
For this journey has been long and 
I’m so weary, 
But somehow I feel so closer Home."
351;OH FOR A THOUSAND TONGUES TO SING;;"Oh for a thousand tongues to sing,
My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His Grace.

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth
abroad,
The honours of Thy Name.

Jesus The Name that charms 
me most, 
That bids our sorrows cease, 
Tis music in the sinner’s ears, 
Tis life, and health, and peace.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin, 
He sets the prisoner free, 
His Blood can make the foulest clean, 
His Blood availed for me.

Hear Him ye hear His praise ye dumb, 
Your loosened tongues employ; 
Ye blind behold, your Saviour come;
And leap ye lame for joy!"
352;MAN OF SORROWS;;"Man of sorrows, what a Name, 
For the Son of God who came, 
Ruined sinners to reclaim, 
Hallelujah, what a Saviour.

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood,
Sealed my pardon with His Blood,
Hallelujah, what a Saviour.

Guilty, vile, and helpless we, 
Spotless Lamb of God was He, 
Full of atonement can’t it be? 
Hallelujah, what a Saviour.

Lifted up was He to die, 
It is finished, was His cry; 
Now in Heaven exalted high; 
Hallelujah, what a Saviour.

When He comes our Glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring
Then a new this song we'll sing,
Hallelujah, what a Saviour."
353;THREE KINDS OF BELIEVERS;;"There's three kinds of believers 
In this world today, 
They gather where the eagles 
go to feed,
 Their lives are so shabby
 And darkened with the world, 
They’re blind and they cannot 
see their need.

CHORUS
Oh we say we're Believers 
Since we believe
All the Word, Our works are 
both great and small;
But If this same Life’s not living
 through you, 
Then you’re not even called
 to at all.

God’s Wife is an Army,
Marching through the land;
Destroying everything in Her way.
There’s many make-Believers
Who fight by her side.
But when they have fallen,
She just leaves them lay.

The true Elect of God
Have died to themselves,
They have all heard the Evening
call!
They know that the Token
Must be displayed,
Or they’re not even 
called to at all!"
354;DON'T LOSE YOUR VISION OF JESUS;;"We have heard all the Thunders
Which are sounding so clear;
And we we’ve seen our Lord in the
Word.
But our lives now are telling the
story so true;
Have we really caught a vision of
Him.

CHORUS
Don't lose your vision of
Jesus;
Keep your eyes ever on Him,
We have all come too far now
We’re almost home
So let’s not lose our vision of
Him.

We’ve seen many who 
have started
And fell by the way;
But God’s Elected are 
making the climb
We can’t afford to look at others
And start following them;
If we do we'll lose our vision of
Him.

Now the Predestinated 
are living the Word
They are hated and rejected 
of men;
But they have caught a 
revelation, 
It’s manifesting through them,
And they'll not lose 
their vision of Him."
355;JUST A LITTLE TALK WITH JESUS;;"I once was lost in sin 
but Jesus took me in;
And then a little Light from heaven 
filled my soul; 
It bathed my heart in love
 And wrote my name above, 
And just a little talk with Jesus 
Made me whole.

CHORUS
Now let us have a little talk
with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles, 
He will hear our faintest cry 
He will answer by and by; 
Now when you feel a little 
prayer wheel turning, 
And you know a little fire is burning, 
You will find a little talk
 With Jesus makes it right.

Sometimes my path seems drear,
Without a ray of cheer;
And then a cloud of doubt may
hide the light of day;
The mists of sin may rise,
And hide the starry skies,
But just a little talk with Jesus
Clears the way.

I may have doubts and fears, 
My eyes may be filled with tears, 
But Jesus is a friend who 
watches day and night,
I go to Him in prayer,
He knows my every care,
And just a little talk with Jesus
Makes it right."
356;I'VE BEEN CHANGED;;"Well, I've been to the river 
and I’ve been baptized, 
I’ve been washed in the
 blood of the Lamb;
I’ve been changed from the creature 
that once I was, 
And Redeemed’ is now my name.

CHORUS
I’ve been changed! 
I am new born now, All my life has 
been rearranged; 
What a difference it made, 
When the Lord came 
and stayed In my heart, 
Oh yes, I’ve been changed.

Satan once ruled my heart but 
Jesus rescued me, 
By His Grace, I can say
 I’ve been redeemed;
I’ve been changed from the 
nature that once held me,
 Where I was bound, 
I now am free."
357;HAND IN HAND;;"Once from my poor sin sick soul
Christ did every burden roll
Now I walk redeemed and whole
Hand in hand with Jesus.

CHORUS
Hand In hand we walk each day
Hand In hand along the way
Walking thus I cannot stray
Hand in hand with Jesus.

When the stars are backward rolled
And His face I shall behold
I will tread the streets of gold
Hand in hand with Jesus."
358;MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE;;"Man shall not live by bread alone,
But by every Word;
That proceeds from the mouth of
God,
Hallelu, Hallelujah!

I AM the Way, the Truth, and the
Life,
That’s what Jesus said;
No man comes to the Father but
by Me,
Hallelu, Hallelujah!

Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, 
arid His righteousness, 
And all these things shall be 
added unto you, 
Hallelu, Hallelujah!

Knock and the Door will be
opened unto you,
Seek and ye shall find;
Ask and it shall be given Unto you,
Hallelu, Hallelujah!
   Chorus
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!Hallelujah!
Hallelu, Hallelujah!"
359;HE TOUCHED ME;;"Shackled by a heavy burden, 
Neath a load of guilt and shame; 
But then the hand of 
Jesus touched me
And now I am no longer
 the same.

CHORUS
He touched, Oh, He touched me, 
And, Oh, the joy that 
floods my soul;
Something happened and now I know, 
He touched me 
and made me whole.

Since I met the blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed and made me
whole;
I will never cease to praise Him,
I’ll shout it while Eternity rolls."
360;TWELVE MEN;;"Jesus walked along the shore one
day
Heavy burdens, love for others,
On Him lay;
He was looking for a friend,
He was searching for twelve men;
Who would gladly follow all the way.
Twelve men, chosen men;
Jesus was looking for twelve men.

First He called for Andrew, by the
shore;
Told his brother, Simon Peter,
He had a chore;
And of one He was so fond,
You recall, his name was John;
Still He called for Judas,
And eight more -
Simon James the Elder, Jude,
Mathew.

Thomas, Philip, James the less,
Bartholomew.
These twelve men the world did hate,
Striving to eliminate;
This is how they finally met their fate
Twelve men, chosen men;
Eleven of them true, but one a
devil
Judas sold the Son of God for silver.

Andrew died upon a cross we hear;
Thomas killed in India, with a
spear;
James the less was sawn in two,
Arrows through the body of Jude,
Philip died by hanging without
fear.
Late in life, by knife, Bartholomew,
Martyred Simon, James the elder;
Writer Mathew.

Simon Peter they say was found, 
Crucified there upside down; 
Only John did live his full life through.
Twelve men, chosen men;
Eleven of them true, 
but one a devil 
Judas hung himself but lost his silver."
361;I SAW THE LIGHT;;"I wandered so aimless,
My life filled with sin,
I wouldn’t let my dear Saviour in;
Then Jesus came like a stranger 
at night;
Praise the Lord, I saw the light.

CHORUS
I saw the Light, I saw the
Light,
No more In darkness, no more
In night;
Now I’m so happy no sorrow in
sight,
Praise the Lord, I saw the
Light.

Just like a blind man
I wandered along,
Worries and cares I 
called for my own;
Then like a blind man 
Whom God gave back his sight, 
Praise the Lord I saw the Light.

I was a fool to wander astray
Strait is the gate narrow the way
Now I have traded wrong 
for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the
Light."
362;BREATHE ON ME, BREATH OF GOD;;"Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Fill me with life a new,
That I may love what Thou dost love,
And do what Thou wouldst do.

Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Until my heart is pure,
Until with Thee my will Thy will,
To do and to endure.

Breathe on me, Breath of God
Till I am wholly Thine,
Till all this earthly part of me,
Glows with Thy Fire Divine.

Breathe on me, Breath of God,
So shall I never die,
But live with Thee the perfect Life
Of Thine Eternity."
363;HEAVEN'S JUBILEE;;"Some glad morning
We shall see Jesus in the air,
Coming after you and me,
Joy is ours to share;
What rejoicing there will be
When the saints shall rise,
Headed for that jubilee,
Yonder in the skies.

CHORUS
Oh, what singing,
Oh, what shouting,
On that happy morning
When we shall rise;
Oh what glory, Hallelujah!
When we meet our  blessed
Saviour in the skies.

Seems that I almost see
All the sainted dead,
Rising for that jubilee,
That is just ahead;
In the twinkling of an eye,
Changed with them to be,
All the living saints to fly
To that jubilee.

When with all the heavenly host
We begin to sing,
Singing in the Holy Ghost,
How the heavens will ring.
Millions there will join the song,
With them we shall be; 
praising Christ through ages long, 
Heaven’s jubilee."
364;TAKE MY HAND, PRECIOUS LORD;;"When my way groweth drear,
Precious Lord, linger near,
When my life is almost gone;
Hear my cry, hear my call,
Hold my hand, lest I fall,
Take my hand precious Lord, lead
me Home. 

CHORUS
Precious Lord, take my hand,
Lead me on, let me stand, 
I am tired, I am weak, 
I am worn;
Through the storm, 
through the night,
Lead me on to the Light, 
Take my hand, precious Lord, 
lead me Home.

When the shadows appear,
And the night draweth near,
And the day is past and gone;
At the river I stand,
Guide my feet, hold my hand,
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead
me Home.

Nearing life-journey’s end 
Be my guide, be my friend, 
Give me strength, Lord to overcome;
I’ll not go all alone, For by grace, 
I’m Thine own; Take my hand, 
precious Lord, lead me Home."
365;WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY;;"As I wake up with the morning,
Of each day that passes by,
And I listen to the sound upon
my ears,
I can’t help but keep a watch
Out toward the Eastern sky, .
And I wonder if the Trumpets
Wll be the next sound that I hear.

CHORUS
What a beautiful day
For the Lord to come again;
What a beautiful day
For Him to take His children
Home
How I long to see His face
And to touch His nail-scarred
hands.
What a beautiful day
For the Lord to come again.

All my earthly disappointments
And trials here below
Fade away when I remember 
His own words
He said He'd return someday
To take His children Home
And I'm longing just to look
Upon the Face of my Lord"
366;JESUS USE ME;;"Oh Lord I've been so selfish
In my work for you
I haven’t been the way
You’d have me be
But now I come repenting
Of my self-centred ways;
And from now on
My life I'll live forThee.

CHORUS
Jesus use me,
Oh Lord please don’t refuse me;
Surely there’s a work that I can do,
And even though I stumble,
Help my will to crumble.
Though the cost be great
I’ll work for you.

There’s many things to do Lord
They may be great or small;
Whatever you want done
Please let me do.
I know there will be rewards Lord,
When at the Judgment bar
If only here I stand and work for you."
367;MY BRAND NEW HOME;;"If you're awed by the world 
and all its beauty,
Many stately mansions daily you may see,
But without great wealth I know 
I'll never own one,
And you will neither if you’re 
no more rich than me.
But if your soul will look beyond 
what man is building,
You can see what earthlymortals 
cannot see.
Far on the other side of Jordan 
there’s construction,
On a mansion being built just for me

CHORUS
And when you see, my brand 
new home. 
When you see it’s beauty rare 
nothing down here can compare. 
Just when you see my brand 
new home.
My heavenly Father’s building me, 
And am gonna occupy for Free, 
Just wait’ll you see, 
my brand new home.

My new home will not sit upon 
foundations
That are man-made and will some 
day pass away
It won' be built, where the storms 
of life can batter
Or where the rain clouds, 
often hide the light of day
Over there the Promised Son of 
God is my foundation
The root of David Christ the 
Lord my coming King
Oh what a welcome and 
homecoming there awaits me
And I'm expecting any day to move
right in."
368;OH MY LOVING BROTHER;;"Oh the judgment day is coming
What an awful day ‘twill be,
Christ forever is my refuge
Rock of Ages cleft for me.

CHORUS
Oh, my loving brother,
When the world’s on fire,
Don’t you want God’s bosom
To be your pillow,
Hide me ever in the Rock of
Ages
Rock of Ages cleft for me,

At the sounding of the trumpet,
At the dawning of the day,
Worldly pleasures with their
treasures
Shall forever pass away.

Poor lost sinners will be crying,
For the home they’ll never see,
But the ransomed will be singing
Rock of Ages, cleft for me."
369;MY SINS ARE GONE;;"You ask me why I’m happy
So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;
And when I meet the scoffers
Who ask me where they are,
I say, my sins are gone.

CHORUS
They're underneath the Blood,
On the Cross of Calvary, 
As far removed as darkness 
is from dawn;
In the sea of God’s forgetfulness, 
That’s good enough for me., 
Praise God, my sins are gone.

Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I’m glad my sins are gone.

I’m living now for Jesus,
I’m happy night and day,
Because my sins are gone;
My soul is filled with music
With all my heart I say,
I know my sins are gone."
370;PSALM 19;;"The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul;
The testimony of the Lord is sure
Making wise the simple.
More to be desired are they than
gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
and the honeycomb.

The statutes of the Lord are right, 
Rejoicing the heart; 
The commandment of the Lord 
is pure, 
Enlightening the eyes. 
More to be desired are they than gold, 
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
and the honeycomb.

The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring for ever;
The judgements of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.
And in the keeping of them
There is great reward,
There is great reward.
In the keeping of them
There is great reward."
371;THE ORIGINAL LIFE;;"God's attributes were manifested
To His Bride in this last age
We have caught the revelation
By the last prophet’s message
And we know who we are
And what we are raised up for
Praise the Lord,
for the Original Life.

Chorus
The Original Life, the Original Seed
The Original Word is what I believe
The Son of Man is revealed
The Seventh Seal is unveiled
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say,
And our names are sealed within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin
Yes, we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who’s the Original Life.

Our eyes of understanding
He has opened up at last
And sweet victory is ours
Who were chained down in the past
True Jubilee has sounded
And we have responded
To our God,
Who’s the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power
Sleeping saints will wake and
join us
For translation in this hour
Gentiles’ days soon will be over
Glory, hallelujah!
To our God,
Who’s the Original Life."
372;WE ARE HEIRS;;"We are heirs of the Father
We are joint-heirs with the Son.
We are people of His Kingdom
We are family, we are one.

We are washed,
We are sanctified.
We are cleansed by His blood.
We are born of the Spirit
We are children of the Lord.

We are members of His body,
We are objects of His love.
We’re partakers of His holiness
We are citizens of heaven above.

We’re partakers of His suffering;
We’re partakers of His grace.
We shall meet Him to be like Him
We shall see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming
We are looking to the skies;
We are watching, we are waiting,
We shall dwell with Him, we shall rise.

We shall reign with Him forever,
Men and angels shout and sing.
For dominion has been given
To the family of the King."
373;THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME;;"This world is not my home
I’m just passing through
My treasures are laid up
Somewhere beyond the blue.
The angels beckon me
From heaven’s open door
And I can’t feel at home
In this world anymore.

CHORUS
Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven’s not my home
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me
From heaven’s open door
And I can’t feel at home
In this world any more.

They’re all expecting me
And that’s one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus
Many years ago
I know He’ll see me through
Tho’ I am weak and poor
And I can’t feel at home
In this world any more.

Just over in the glory land,
We’ll live eternally;
The saints on every hand
Are shouting victory
The songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven’s shore
AndI can’t feel at home
In this world any more."
374;A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR LORD;;"A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe -
His craft and pow’r are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God’s own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He -
Lord Saviour His Name,
From age to age the same -
And He must win the battle.

And tho this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God bath willed
His truth to triumph thru us.
The Prince of darkness grim -
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lot His doom is sure -
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow’rs -
No thanks to them - abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Thru Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God’s truth abideth still -
His kingdom is forever."
375;HE PAID A DEBT;;"He paid a debt He did not owe,
I owed a debt I could not pay,
I needed someone to wash my sins
away;
And now I sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay.

He paid a debt at Calvary, 
He cleansed my soul and 
set me free, 
I’m glad that Jesus 
did all my sins erase.
I now can sing a brand new song, 
Amazing grace all day long, 
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay.

One day He’s coming back for me,
To live with Him eternally,
Won’t it be glory to see Him on
that day!
I then will sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay."
376;UNTIL THEN;;"My heart can sing
when I pause to remember, 
A heartache here
is but a stepping stone
Along the trail
that’s winding always upward, 
This troubled world 
is not my final home.

CHORUS
But until then, my heart 
will go on singing, 
Until then, with joy I’ll carry on, 
Until the day mine eyes
behold the city 
Until the day God calls me home.

The things of earth 
will dim and lose their value, 
If we recall, 
they’re borrowed for a while
And things of earth 
that cause the heart to tremble
Remembered there, 
will only bring a smile.

This weary world 
with all its toil and struggle,
May take its toil of misery and strife, 
The soul of man
is like a waiting eagle 
When it’s released it’s destined
for the sky."
377;SEARCH ME OH GOD;;"Search me, 0 God! 
my actions try,
And let my life appear
As seen by Thine all-searching eye
To mine my ways make clear.

Search all my sense, and know my
heart,
Who only canst' make known,
And let the deep, the hidden part
To me be fully shown

Throw light into the darkened cells
Where passion reigns within;
Quicken my conscience till it feels
The loathsomeness of sin.

Search all my thoughts, 
the secret springs, 
The motives that control; 
The chambers where polluted things
Hold empire o’er the soul.

Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast
It's holy light through all,
And I by grace am brought at last
Before Thy face to fall.
 

Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee
What now I feebly prove,
That God alone in Christ can be
Unutterable love!"
378;I GAVE MY LIFE FOR THEE;;"I gave my life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead:
I gave My life for thee;
What has thou given for Me?

I spent long years for thee
In weariness and woe,
That an eternity
Of joy thou mightest know:
I spent long years for thee;
Hast thou spent one for Me?

My Father’s home of light,
My rainbow-circled throne,
I left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone:
I left it all for thee;
Hast thou left aught for Me?

I suffered much for thee,
More than thy tongue can tell
Of bitter agony
To rescue thee from hell:
I suffered much for thee;
What canst' thou bear for Me?

Lord, let my life be given,
And every moment spent,
For God, for souls, for heaven,
And all earth’s ties be rent,
Thou gav’st Thyself for me,
Now I give all for Thee."
379;COME THOU FOUNT OF  BLESSING;;"Come, Thou Fount of every
blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

Oh, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I’m constrained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, 
Prone to leave the God I love:
Here’s my heart; Lord,
 take and seal it,
Seal it from Thy courts above."
380;TRUST AND OBEY;;"When we walk with the Lord,
In the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and
obey!

CHORUS
Trust and obey!
For there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus -
Than to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise, 
Not a cloud in the skies, 
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt nor a fear, 
Not a sigh nor a tear, 
Can abide while we trust and obey!

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay:
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown nor a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favour He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and
obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side
In the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go -
Never fear, only trust and obey!"
381;TAKE MY LIFE AND LET IT BE;;"Take my life and let it be
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee; 
Take my moments and my days,
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee.
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.
Filled with messages from Thee.

Take my silver and my gold,
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will, and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine:
Take my heart, it is Thine own;
It shall be Thy royal throne.
It shall be Thy royal throne.

Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet it's treasure store:
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all, for Thee.
Ever, only, all, for Thee."
382;WHO IS ON THE LORD'S SIDE?;;"Who is on the Lord’s side?
Who will serve the King?
Who will be His helper
Other lives to bring?
Who will leave the world’s side?
Who will face the foe?
Who is on the Lord’s side?
Who for Him will go?

By Thy grand redemption,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord’s side:
Saviour, we are Thine!

Not for weight of glory,
Not for crown and palm,
Enter we the army,
Raise the warrior-palm;
But for love that claimeth
Lives for whom He died:
He whom Jesus nameth
Must be on His side!

By Thy love constraining,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord’s side
Saviour, we are Thine.

Jesus, Thou hast bought us,
Not with gold or gem,
But with Thine own life-blood,
For Thy diadem:
With Thy blessing filling
All who come to Thee,
Thou has made us willing,
Thou has made us free.

By Thy grand redemption,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord’s side
Saviour, we are Thine!
Fierce may be the conflict,
Strong may be the foe,
But the King’s own army
None can overthrow;
Round His standard raging,
Victory is secure,
For His truth unchanging,
Makes the triumph sure.

Joyfully enlisting,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord’s side:
Saviour, we are Thine!

Chosen to be soldiers
In an alien land,
Chosen, called, and faithful,
For our Captain’s band.
In His service royal,
Let us not grown cold;
Let us be right loyal,
Noble, true, and bold.]

Master, Thou wilt keep us,
By Thy grace divine,
Always on the Lord’s side,
Saviour, always Thine"
383;THE CHURCH'S ONE FOUNDATION;;"The Church’s one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is Her new creation
By water and the Word
From heaven He came
and sought her
To be His holy Bride,
With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o’er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy Name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses, 
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed:
Yet saints their watch are keeping,
Their cry goes up, “How long?”
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song.

‘Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace for evermore;
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious 
Shall be the Church at rest.

Yet she on earth hath union
With God the blessed King,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won,
Oh, happy ones and holy!

384;WITHER PILGRIMS ARE YOU GOING?;;"Wither, pilgrims, are you going,
Going each with staff in hand?
We are going on a journey,
Going to our King’s command,
Over hills and plains and valleys,
We are going to His palace,
(Repeat)
Going to the better land.

Tell us, pilgrims, what you hope for
In that far-off, better land?
Spotless robes, and crowns of
glory,
From a Saviour’s loving hand.
We shall drink of life’s clear river,
We shall dwell with God for ever,

In that bright, that better land.

Pilgrims, may we travel with you
To that bright and better land?

385;A FEW MORE YEARS SHALL ROLL;;"A few more years shall roll
A few more seasons come,
And we shall be with those that
rest
Asleep within the tomb.
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that great day;
Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.

A few more suns shall set
O’er these dark hills of time,
And we shall be where suns are not -
A far serener clime.
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that bright day;
Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood
And take my sins away.

A few more storms shall beat
On this wild rocky shore,
And we shall be where tempests
cease,
And surges swell no more.
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that calm day;
Oh, wash me in Thy precious
blood,
And take my sins way.

A few more struggles here,
A few more partings o’er,
A few more toils, a few more tears,
And we shall weep no more.
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that blest day;
Oh, wash me in Thy precious
blood,
And take my sins away.

‘Tis but a little while
 And He shall come again, 
Who died that we might live - who lives
That we with Him may reign:
Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul
 for that glad day; 
Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood,
 And take my sins away."
386;JERUSALEM, THE GOLDEN;;"Jerusalem the golden,
With milk and honey blest,
Beneath thy contemplation
Sink heart and voice oppressed:
I know not, oh, I know not,
What joys await us there,
What radiancy of glory,
What bliss beyond compare.

They stand, those hills of Zion,
All jubilant with song;
And bright with many an angel,
And all the martyr-throng:
The Prince is ever in them,
The daylight is serene,
The pastures of the blessed
Are decked in glorious sheen.

There is the throne of David,
And there, from care released,
The shout of them that triumph,
The song of them that feast;
And they who with their Leader
Have conquered in the fight,
For ever and for ever
Are clothed in robes of white.

Oh, sweet and blessed country,
The home of God’s elect!
Oh, sweet and blessed country
That eager hearts expect!
Jesus, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest,
Who art, with God the Father,
And Spirit, ever blest."
387;BREAK THOU THE BREAD OF LIFE;;"Break Thou the Bread of Life,
Dear Lord, to me,
As Thou did'st break the bread
Beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page
I seek Thee, Lord,
My spirit longs for Thee,
Thou living Word.

Thou art the Bread of Life,
Oh Lord, to me,
Thy Holy Word the truth
That saveth me;
Give me to eat and live
With Thee above,
Teach to love Thy truth,
For Thou art love.

Oh, send Thy Spirit, Lord,
Now unto me, -
That He may touch my eyes
And make me see;
Show me the truth concealed
Within Thy Word,
And in Thy Book revealed,
I see Thee, Lord.

Bless Thou the Bread of Life
To me, to me,
As Thou didst bless the loaves
By Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My all in all."
388;CLING TO THE BIBLE;;"Cling to the Bible, 
though all else be taken;
Lose not its precepts so precious 
and pure;
Souls that are sleeping its tidings 
awaken:
Life from the dead in its promises 
sure.

CHORUS
Cling to the Bible!
Cling to the Bible!
ClIng to the Bible!
Our lamp and our guide!

Cling to the Bible! - 
this jewel and treasure
Brings life eternal, and saves 
fallen man;
Surely its value no mortal can 
measure:
Seek for its blessing, 0 soul, 
while you can!

Lamp for the feet that in 
by-ways have wandered, 
Guide for the youth that 
would otherwise fall;
Hope for the sinner whose life 
has been squandered;
Staff for the aged, and best Book 
for all!"
389;HOLY BIBLE, BOOK DIVINE;;"Holy Bible, Book divine,
Precious treasure, thou art mine;
Mine, to tell me whence I came,
Mine, to tell me what I am.

Mine, to chide me when I rove,
Mine, to show a Saviour’s love;
Mine thou art to guide and guard,
Mine, to punish or reward.

Mine, to comfort in distress,
Suffering in this wilderness;
Mine, to show, by living faith,
Man can triumph over death.

Mine, to tell of joy’ to come,
And the rebel sinner’s doom;
Holy Bible, Book divine
Precious treasure, thou art mine!"
390;LORD THY WORD ABIDETH;;"Lord, Thy Word abideth,
And our footsteps guideth;
Who it's truth believeth
Light and joy receiveth.

When our foes are near us
Then Thy Word doth cheer us,
Word of consolation,
Message of Salvation.

When the storms are o’er us,
And dark clouds before us,
Then it's light directeth,
And our way protecteth.

Who can tell the pleasure,
Who recount the treasure,
By Thy Word imparted
To the simple-hearted?

Word of mercy, giving,
Succour to the living;
Word of life, supplying
Comfort to the dying.

Oh, that we discerning
Its most holy learning
Lord, may love and fear Thee,
Ever more be near Thee."
391;SUN OF MY SOUL THOU SAVIOUR DEAR;;"Sun of my soul, 
Thou Saviour dear,
 It is not night if Thou be near; 
Oh, may no earth-born cloud arise 
To hide Thee from Thy servants eyes!

When the soft dews of gentle sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep,
Be my last thought, how sweet to
rest
For ever on my Saviour’s Breast!

Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live;
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die.

If some poor wandering child of Thine
Have spurned today the voice divine, 
Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;
Let him no more lie down in sin.

Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
With blessings from Thy
boundless store:
Be every mourner’s sleep tonight
Like infant’s slumbers, pure and
light.

Come near and bless us when we wake, 
Ere through the world our way we take; 
Till, in the ocean of Thy love, 
We lose ourselves in heaven above."
392;ABIDE WITH ME, FAST FALLS THE EVENTIDE;;"Abide with me fast falls 
the eventide;
The darkness deepens:
Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail, 
and comforts flee;
Help of the helpless, oh, 
abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out
life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories 
pass away;
Change and decay in all 
around I see;
Oh Thou, who changest not, 
abide with me.

I need Thy presence every 
passing hour:
What but Thy grace can foil the 
tempter’s power?
Who like Thyself my guide and 
stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine,
Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand 
to bless, 
Ills have no weight, and tears no 
bitterness. 
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, 
thy victory? 
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Reveal thyself before my closing eyes, 
Shine through the gloom, 
and point me to the skies:
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s
 vain shadows flee:
In life, in death, O Lord, 
abide with me."

blessing,
Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
Let us each, Thy love possessing,
Triumph in redeeming grace:
Oh, refresh us!
Travelling through this wilderness.

Thanks we give, and adoration,
For Thy Gospel’s joyful sound;
May the fruits of Thy salvation
In our hearts and lives abound:
May Thy presence
With us ever more be found!

So, whene’er the signal’s given
Us from earth to call away,
Borne on angels’ wings to heaven,
Glad the summons to obey,
May we ever
Reign with Christ in endless day!"
394;FOR EVER WITH THE LORD;;"Forever with the Lord!
Amen, so let it be!
Life from the dead is in that Word,
‘Tis immortality.
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day’s march nearer home.

My Father’s house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times to faith’s foreseeing eye
Thy golden gates appear!
Ah! Then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.

For ever with the Lord!
Father, if ‘tis Thy will,
The promise of that faithful Word
E’en here to me fulfil.
Be Thou at my right hand,
Then can I never fail;
Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand:
Fight, and I must prevail.

So when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death I shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.
That resurrection word,
That shout of victory;
Once more, For ever with the
Lord!
Amen, so let it be"
395;WE HAVE HEARD THE JOYFUL SOUND;;"We have heard the joyful sound:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Tell the message all around:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Bear the news to every land,

Climb the steeps and cross the
waves
Onward! - tis our Lord’s command:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Waft it on the rolling tide:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Say to sinners far and wide,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Sing, ye islands of the sea;
Echo back, ye ocean caves;
Earth shall keep her jubilee:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Sing above the toil and strife,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
By His death and endless life
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Sing it softly through the gloom,
When the heart for mercy craves;
Sing in triumph o’er the tomb,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Give the winds a mighty voice:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Let the nations now rejoice:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Shout salvation full and free
To every strand that ocean waves;
This our song of victory,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!"
396;JESUS SHALL REIGN WHERE’ER THE SUN;;"Jesus shall reign where’er the 
sun doth his successive
 journeys run:
His kingdom stretch from 
shore to Shore
Till moons shall wax and 
wane no more

For Him shall endless prayer 
be made, 
And princes throng to crown 
His head:
His name sweet perfume 
shall rise 
With every morning sacrifice.

People and realms of every
 tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest
song,
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on 
His Name.

Blessings abound where’er 
He reigns;
The prisoner leaps to lose 
his chains, 
The weary find eternal rest, 
And all the Sons of want 
are blest.

Let every creature rise 
and bring
Peculiar honours to our King:
Angels, descend with songs again
And, earth, repeat the loud 
Amen."
397;WE ARE LITTLE CHILDREN;;"We are little children,
Very young indeed,
But the Saviour’s promise
Each of us may plead.
If we seek Him early, 
if we come today, 
We can be Ills little friends,
 He has said we may.

Little friends of Jesus -
What a happy thought
What a precious promise
In the Bible taught!

Little friends of Jesus,
Walking by His side,
With His arm around us,
Every step to guide.
We must love Him dearly,
With a constant love,
Then we’ll go and see Him
In our home above."
398;CASTING DOWN IMAGINATIONS;;"I've found new a way 
of praying,
I’ve started praying the Word,
Just believing what 
God said,
And not what I’ve always 
heard.
Now my feelings would fool me
Lead me wrong every time
Reasonings deceive me
So am not trusting my mind.

CHORUS
(But) Well I'm casting down my imaginations 
Every high thing that exalted itself
Against the knowledge of God 
Bringing into captivity
 Every thought to the obedience 
of Christ.

I’ve found a new way of feeling
I’ve started feeling by faith
I didn’t get it by thinking
I only got it by grace
When my mind tries to tell me
The Word of God isn’t true
I don’t let devil deceive me
I’ll tell you just what I do.

Casting down
I’m casting down, casting down."
399;SUFFER NOT LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO ME;;"When mothers of Salem
Their children brought to Jesus,
The stern disciples drove 
them back,
And bade them depart:
But Jesus saw them ere they fled,
And sweetly smiled and kindly said,
Suffer not little children to come unto
Me.

For I will receive them,
And fold them in My bosom;
I’ll be a Shepherd to those lambs,
Oh, drive them not away!
For if their hearts to Me they give,
They shall with Me in glory live:
Suffer not little children to come unto
Me.

How kind was our Saviour 
To bid those children welcome! 
But there are many thousands 
who have never heard His Name; 
The Bible they have never read; 
They know not that the 
Saviour said, 
Suffer not little children to 
come unto Me.

Oh, soon may the heathen
Of every tribe and nation
Fulfil Thy blessed word, and cast
Their idols all away;
Oh, shine upon them from above,
And show Thyself a God of love;
Teach the little children to come
unto Thee."
400;JESUS BIDS US SHINE;;"Jesus bids us shine
With a pure, clear light;
Like a little candle
Burning in the night.
In this world of darkness,
So we must shine -
You in your small corner,
And I in mine.

Jesus bids us shine,
First of all for Him;
Well He sees and knows it
If our light grows dim.
He looks down from heaven
To see us shine -
You in your small corner,
And I in mine.

Jesus bids us shine,
Then, for all around;
Many kinds of darkness
In this world abound
Sin and want and sorrow;
so we must shine -
You in your small corner
And I in mine"
401;JESUS LOVES EVEN ME;;"I am so glad that our 
Father in heaven
Tells of His love in the 
Book He has given; 
Wonderful things in the Bible 
I see;
This is the dearest, that Jesus 
loves me.

CHORUS
I am so glad that Jesus 
loves me, Jesus loves me, 
Jesus loves me:
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
 Jesus loves even me.

Though I forget Him, 
and wander away,
 Still He doth love me 
wherever I stray; 
Back to His dear, loving arms
 would I flee, 
When I remember that 
Jesus loves me.

Oh, if there’s only one 
song I can sing
When in His beauty I 
see the great King?
This shall my song in 
eternity be, 
Oh, what a wonder that 
Jesus loves me?

Jesus loves me, and I 
know I love Him;
Love brought Him down 
my poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was love made 
Him die on the tree:
Oh I am certain that 
Jesus loves me!

If one should ask of me, 
how can I tell? 
Glory to Jesus I know very well! 
God’s Holy Spirit with mine 
doth agree, 
Constantly witnessing - 
Jesus loves me.

In this assurance I find 
sweetest rest, 
Trusting in Jesus, I know 
I am blest; 
Satan, dismayed, from my soul 
now doth flee,
When I just tell him that 
Jesus loves me."
402;IMMORTAL, INVISIBLE, GOD ONLY WISE;;"Immortal, invisible, God only wise, 
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes, 
Most blessed, most glorious, 
the Ancient of Days,
 Almighty, victorious, 
Thy great Name we praise.

Unresting, unhasting, 
and silent as light, 
Nor wanting, nor wasting, 
Thou rulest in might;
Thy justice like mountains 
high soaring above, 
Thy clouds which are 
fountains of goodness 
and love.

To all life Thou givest, 
to both great and small; 
In all life Thou livest, 
the true life of all; 
We blossom and flourish as
 leaves on the tree, 
And wither and perish, 
but naught changeth Thee."
403;AND CAN IT BE THAT I SHOULD GAIN;;"And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Saviour’s 
blood?
Died He for me, 
who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to 
death pursued?
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou, my God, 
should’st die for me?

Tis mystery all! The immortal dies!
 Who can explore 
His strange design?
In vain the first-born 
seraph tries To sound the 
depths of love Divine! 
Tis mercy all! Let earth adore, 
Let angel minds inquire no more.

He left His Father’s throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam’s helpless race;
‘Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, 0 my God, it found out me.

Long my imprisoned spirit lay 
Fast bound in sin and nature’s 
night; Thine eye diffused a 
quickening ray, 
I woke, the dungeon flamed 
with light; 
My chains fell off, my heart was free; 
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.

No condemnation now I dread; 
Jesus and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness
divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through
Christ my own."
404;FILL THOU MY LIFE, 0 LORD MY GOD;;"Fill Thou my life, 0 Lord my God,
In every part with praise,
That my whole being may proclaim
Thy being and Thy ways.

Not for the lip of praise alone, 
Nor e’en the praising heart, 
I ask, but for a life made up
Of praise in every part:

Praise in the common things of life,
Its goings out and in;
Praise in each duty and each deed,
However small and mean.

Fill every part of me with praise
Let all my being speak
Of Thee and of Thy love, 0 Lord,
Poor though I be and weak."
405;STAND UP, AND BLESS THE LORD;;"Stand up, and bless the Lord,
Ye people of His choice;
Stand up, and bless the
Lord your God
With heart, and soul, and voice.

Though high above all praise,
Above all blessing high,
Who would not fear His holy Name,
And laud and magnify?

Oh, for the living flame
From His won altar brought,
To touch our lips, our minds inspire,
And wing to Heav’n our thought.

God is our strength and song,
And His salvation ours;
Then be His love in Christ proclaimed
With all our ransomed powers.

Stand up, and bless the Lord,
The Lord your God adore;
Stand up, and bless His glorious Name
Hence forth for ever more."
406;MASTER, SPEAK THY SERVANT HEARETH;;"Master, speak! 
Thy servant heareth, 
Longing for Thy gracious word, 
Longing for Thy voice that cheereth:
Master, let It now be heard. 
I am listening, 
Lord, for Thee; 
What has Thou to say to me?

Often through my 
heart is hearing
Many another voice than Thine,
Many an unwilled echo stealing
From the walls of this Thy shrine.
Let Thy longed-for accents fall;
Master, speak! And silence all.

Master, speak! 
Though least and lowest, 
Let me not unheard depart; 
Master speak! For oh, 
Thou knowest 
All the yearning of my heart, 
Knowest all its truest need; 
Speak! And make me blest 
indeed.

Master, speak!
And make me ready,
When Thy voice is truly heard,
With obedience glad and steady,
Still to follow every word.
I am listening, Lord, for Thee:
Master, speak, oh; 
speak to me!

Speak to me by name, 
0 Master, Let me know it is to me;
Speak that I may follow faster,
With a step more firm and free,
Where the Shepherd leads 
the flock,
In the shadow of the Rock!"
407;I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE LAMB;;"I’ve heard how Christians 
long ago, 
Were brought before a tyrant’s
 throne, 
They were told that he would
spare their lives
If they would renounce 
The Name of Christ 

But one by one they 
chose to die 
For the Son of God 
they would not deny
Like a great angelic 
choir sings 
I can almost hear their 
voices ring.

I pledge allegiance 
to the Lamb
With all my strength, 
with all I am
I will seek to honour His 
commands 
I pledge allegience to... 
The Lamb.

Now the years have come,
And the years have gone 
And the cause of Jesus 
still goes on
Now a time has come to 
count the cost
To reject this world, and to
embrace The Cross

And on by one let us live
our lives
For the one who died 
To give us life
Till the trumpet sounds on the 
final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly
say

I pledge allegiance 
to the Lamb
With all my strength, 
will all I am
I will seek to honour 
His commands 
I pledge allegience to... The Lamb.

To the Lamb of God ... 
who bore pain
Who took my place 
who wore my shame
I will seek to honour His 
commands
I have pledged allegience 
to the Lamb."
408;THE MESSENGER THAT CAME;;"The messenger that came, 
William Branham was his Name;
God through him He opened 
up the seven seals
He taught us of the serpent 
seed many more things 
God revealed 
And he said, 
check it out with the Word

CHORUS
Listen to God and repent,
And be baptized in The Name
Of the Lord Jesus Christ
Ye shall receive the
Holy Ghost,
Not many days hence
And His signs shall follow
them.

Thank God, thank God, for the
prophet He sent today 
Or else He had to smite 
the earth with a curse
Get down on your knees and pray, 
And ask God to lead the way 
Through this prophet 
God showed us the way!"
409;LORD BUILD ME A CABIN IN GLORY;;"Many years I have been 
looking for a place to 
call a home 
But I have failed here to 
find it so I must travel on; 
I don’t care for a bright 
mansion on earth’s sinking 
sand Lord build me a cabin
 in the corner of glory land.

CHORUS
Lord build me a cabin In the 
corner of glory land, 
In the shade of the tree of 
life that It may ever stand; 
Where I could hear the angels 
sing and shake Jesus hand 
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of 
glory land.

Blessed Lord I’m not asking 
to live in this earth, 
For I know I’m not worthy 
of the splendour I have seen 
Lord I am asking for mercy 
while on Thee I stand, 
Lord build me a cabin in 
the corner of glory land.

I’ve many dear loved ones
who’ve gone on that way, 
On that great final morning 
I shall I hear them sing, 
I’ll join in their singing and 
playing in the band, 
Lord build me a cabin in the 
corner of glory land."

money wouldn’t buy 
I've found a good mansion 
beyond the blue sky, 
I've found aland where 
I'll live when I die
I’ve found the Lord a 
rich man am I
I've found the Lord a 
rich man am I

People may say that I am 
dreaming rubbish 
But I believe what I’m believing
and I’m not gonna quit 
The Bible says I gonna 
live when I die
I’ve found the Lord a 
rich man am I.
I’ve found the Lord a 
rich man am I.

I’ve found a dream that 
will surely come true
I’ve found the rainbow that 
will never turn blue
I’ve found a land where tears are so
dry;
I’ve found the Lord a rich man am I.
I've found the Lord a rich man am I.

I’ve found a song that angels cannot
sing
I’ve found a way to be rich as a King
I’ve found the love that will burn till
I die,
I’ve found the Lord a rich man am I
I’ve found the Lord a rich man am I."
411;MY WONDERFUL LORD;;"I have found a deep peace, 
I never had known, 
And a joy this world could 
not afford, 
Since I yielded control of my 
body and soul 
To my wonderful, 
wonderful Lord.

CHORUS
My wonderful Lord, my
wonderful Lord;
By angels and seraphs In 
heaven adored; 
I bow at Thy Shrine, My Saviour 
divine, 
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

I desire that my life 
shall be ordered by Thee, 
That my will be in perfect accord; 
With Thine own sovereign 
will my desires to fulifil
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

All the talents I have, 
I have laid at Thy feet, 
Thy approval shall be my reward; 
Be it too great or small I 
surrender it all,
To my wonderful, wonderful Lord.

Thou art dearer to me than 
the fairest of earth, 
Thou omnipotent life giving word;
Oh Thou ancient of days, 
Thou art worthy all praise 
My wonderful, wonderful Lord."
412;I SEE JESUS;;"Once a man named Stephen 
preached about the Lord, 
Folks were saved and folks 
were healed, 
as they heard his word, 
Satan did not like it 
soon he had his crowd, 
As they tried him, 
they heard Stephen cry aloud:

CHORUS
I see Jesus standing at the 
Father’s right hand, 
I see Jesus yonder in the 
Promised Land, 
Work here Is over, 
now I’m coming to Thee, 
I see Jesus, 
standing waiting for me.

As the stones fell on him, 
beating out his life, 
Stephen knew he would be through 
with all trials and strives, 
And so much like the Master 
with a heart so true (he prayed) 
""Lord forgive them, 
for they know not what they do.

Through the gates of glory, 
down the streets of gold,

As he met his Master 
at the great white Throne
I believe He smiled and said:
Stephen welcome home!"

I do not fear when the storms
are near
My home Is on the Rock.

When come life’s trials 
thick and fast,
When clouds are o’er 
my pathway;
It is not built on sinking sand,
My home is on the Rock.

When troubles come 
that would appall, 
When other buildings round 
me fail;
It is not built on sinking sand, 
My home is on the Rock.

And when my time has come to go,
I’ll have a mansion in the sky;
It is not built on sinking sand,
My home is on the Rock."
415;MANY THINGS ABOUT TOMORROW;;"I don't know about tomorrow,
I just live from day to day;
I don't borrow from it's sunshine,
For the sky may turn to grey;
I don’t worry for the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
And today I’ll walk beside Him,
For He knows what lies ahead.

CHORUS
Many things about tomorrow, 
I don’t seem to understand; 
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand.

Every step is getting lighter,
As the golden stairs I climb,
Every burden is getting lighter
Every sky is silver lined,
Where the sun is ever shining,
There’s no tear to dim the eyes;
At the ending of the rainbow
Where the mountains touch the sky.

I don’t know about tomorrow
It may bring me poverty;
But the one who feeds the sparrows
Is the one who stands by me;
And the path that is my portion,
May be through the flame of life,
But His presence goes before me
And I’m covered with His blood."

I know Thou art mine, 
For Thee all the pleasures 
of sin I resign;
My Gracious Redeemer, 
My Saviour art Thou, 
If ever I loved Thee, 
My Jesus, ‘tis now.

I love Thee because 
Thou hast first loved me, 
And purchased my pardon when
nailed to the tree, 
I love Thee for wearing the 
thorns on Thy brow, 
If ever I loved Thee, 
My Jesus, ‘tis now.

I will love Thee in life, 
I will love Thee in death, 
And praise Thee as long 
as Thou lendest me breath; 
And say, when the death-dew lies 
cold on my brow, 
If ever I loved Thee, 
My Jesus, 'tis now."
417;WHEN THE STORMS OF LIFE...;;"When the storms 
of life are raging,
Tempests world,
on sea and land,
I will seek a place of refuge
In the shadow of God’s hand.

CHORUS
He will hide me, He will hide me,
Where no harm can e’er
betide me;
He will hide me, safely hide me
In the shadow of His hand.

Though He may send 
some affliction, 
Twill but make me long for home; 
For in love and not in anger, 
All His chastenings will come.

Enemies may strive to injure,
Satan all his acts employ;
He will turn what seems to
harm me
Into everlasting joy.

So, while here the cross
I’m bearing
Meeting storms and billows wild,
Jesus for my soul is caring,
Naught can harm
His father’s child."

Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
Vile and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace.

Plenteous grace with
Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound,
Make and keep me pure within,

Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity."

Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.

418;PRAYER WITH FASTING;;"On Sinai Mount with radiant face
To intercede for Heaven’s grace
Upon the stubborn wayward race

Once lifted from the miry clay
When opposition came His way
David the King would often pray
With fasting.

Daniel possessed a visions gift
He told the troubled king his dream
Had light on God’s prophetic scheme
Through fasting.

The prophetess in the temple court
Beheld the Babe the two had brought
For Him she longed and sought and

with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy

And you will be singing 
as the days go by.

When you look at others 
with their lands and gold, 
Think that Christ has promised 
you His wealth untold;

Money cannot buy 
Your reward in Heaven, 
nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict,
whether great or small, 
Do not be discouraged,

Count your many blessings, 
angels will attend, 
Help and comfort give you 
to your journey’s end."
428;THROUGH IT ALL;;"I've had many tears and sorrow, 
I've had questions for tomorrow, 
Many times I didn't know
right from wrong;
But in every situation, 
God gave me blessed consolation,
 That my trials only come 
to make me strong.

CHORUS
Through it all, through It all,
I’ve learned to trust in Jesus
I’ve learned to trust In God;
Through It all, through it all,
I’ve learned to depend
upon His Word.

I’ve been to a lot of places, 
And I’ve seen lots of faces, 
But there've been times 
that I felt so all alone;
But in my lonely hours, 
Those precious lonely hours, 
Jesus let me know that 
I am all His own.

So I thank God for the 
mountains,
And I thank Him for the valleys,
And I thank Him for the storms
He brought me through;
For if I never had any problems,
How could I know that God
could solve them;
And I woud not know what faith in
God can do."
429;MESSAGE OF HIS COMING;;"We're looking for His coming, 
in the clouds of heaven, 
Coming back to earth 
to catch away His own;

To go and reign with 
Christ on His throne.

CHORUS
Gladly may we herald the message 
of His blessed appearing, 
Soon He’s coming In glory, 
tell to one and all; 
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, 
Why slumber 
when the end Is nearing, 
But get ready for the final call.

We’re longing for the glory 
that awaits the faithful, 
Who shall overcome, 
and every conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward, 
The prize is life eternal 
To all who win the fight over sin.

We’re praying for the advent 
of our blessed Saviour, 
Who has promised life 
to all who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending, 
the message being given,
And soon we’ll see 
our Lord face to face.

We see the signs appearing 
of His blessed coming, 
Lo, behold the fig leaves 
now becoming green; 
The gospel of His kingdom 
has gone to every nation;
That we are near
the end can be seen."
430;NO NEVER ALONE;;"I've seen the lightning flashing,
And heard the thunder roll;
I've felt sin’s breakers dashing,
Trying to conquer my soul;
I've heard the voice of my Saviour,
Telling me still to fight on;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

CHORUS
No, never alone! 
No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me, 
Never to leave me alone; 
No, never alone! 
No, never alone
He promised never to leave me, 
Never to leave me alone.

The world’s fierce winds are
 blowing,
Temptations sharp and keen;
I feel a peace in knowing
My Saviour stands between;
He stands to shield me from
 danger,
When earthly friends are gone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

When in affliction’s valley,
I’m treading the road of care;
My Saviour helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet, entangled with briars,
Ready to cast me down,
My Saviour whispers 
 His promise,
I never will leave thee alone.

He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side;
For me He opened the fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He’s waiting in glory,
Sealed upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone."
431;THE OLD FASHIONED MEETING;;"Oh, how well I remember 
in the old-fashioned days,
 When some old-fashioned 
people had
some old-fashioned ways; 
In the old-fashioned meetings, 
as they tarried there, 
In the old-fashioned manner, 
How God answered their prayer.

CHORUS
Twas an old-fashioned meeting, 
In an old-fashioned place,
 Where some old-fashioned 
people had some 
old-fashioned grace:
As an old-fashioned sinner 
I began to pray, 
And God heard me, 
and saved me in the 
old-fashioned way.

There was singing, 
such singing of those 
old-fashioned airs! 
There was power, such power in those 
old-fashioned prayers, 
An old-fashioned conviction 
made the sinner pray,
 And the Lord,heard and 
saved him, 
In the old-fashioned way.

Well, they say it is better,
Things have changed 
don’t you know,
And the people in general, 
seem to think it is so;
And they call me old-fashioned 
when I dare to say, 
That I like it far better in 
the old-fashioned way.

If the Lord never changes, 
as the fashions of men, 
If He’s always the same, why, 
He is old-fashioned then! 
As an old-fashioned sinner saved 
thro’ old time grace, 
Oh, I’m sure He will take me to an 
old-fashioned place."
432;GO AHEAD;;"Go, ahead, drive the
nails in my hand, 
Laugh at me, where you stand,

CHORUS
Cause I’ll rise again, 
Ain’t no power on earth 
can tie me down; 
Yes, I’ll rise again, 
Death can’t keep me 
in the ground.

Go ahead, and mock my name,
My love for you is still the same;
Go ahead, and bury me,
But very soon, I will be free.

Go ahead, and say I’m dead
and gone, 
But you will see that 
you were wrong;
Go ahead, try to hide the Son, 
But all will see, that I’m the One.

Cause I'll come again
Ain't no power on earth can
keep me back
Yes, I'll come again
Come to take My people back"
433;READY TO LEAVE;;"Some folks are building 
homes down
here and planning ahead,
 So busy with their fortunes, 
They forget what Jesus said, 
About the wars and 
earthquakes,

people getting ready to leave.

CHORUS
Ready to leave in the twinkling 
of an eye, 
Making investments In the bank 
up In the sky, 
Happy preparations, not a reason 
to grieve, 
Are you in that number 
getting ready to leave?

Sinner, what’s the reason for your
needless delay?
While you’re hesitating 
Christ could come just any day. 
Heed the Saviour calling, 
make your way to Calvary, 
And get in that number 
getting ready to leave."
434;WHO AM I?;;"When I think of how 
He came so far from glory,
Came to dwell amongst 
the lowly such as I, 
To suffer shame and such disgrace, 
On Mt. Calvary take my place, 
Then I ask myself the 
question, 
Who am I?

CHORUS
Who am I that a King would 
bleed and die for? 
Who am I that He would
pray not my will thine Lord? 
The answer I may never know, 
Why He ever loved me so, 
That to an old rugged cross 
He'd go 
For who am I?

When I’m reminded of His word,
I'll leave thee never,
Just be true, I’ll give to you a life
Forever,
I wonder what I could have done,
To deserve God’s only Son
To fight my battles until they’re won,
Who am I?"
435;WHO I AM?;Bb;"Oh glorious victory
That day He set me free,
And He made my heart His very throne.
My life is no longer mine,
I'm a prisoner of love divine,
And now I live to praise His name.

CHORUS
Who I am, Lord, who I am,
I can see now, who I am.
A part of my Saviour,
A part of His Word.
It's a revelation (It's predestination)
Of who I am.

On Calvary He died
To redeem His lost Bride,
The King of Kings
Became my Saviour;
This is God's great mystery
Of love expressed to me,
That Christ and I
Might be made one!"

And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel Cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

With His blood He purchased me
On the Cross He sealed my pardon, 
Paid the debt and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer, 
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth, 
Over sin, and death, and hell.

I will sing of my Redeemer,
 And His heavenly love to me;

Of His free, unbounded grace."

What a joyful thought that my
Lord I'll see,
Just over in the glory land;
And with kindred saved, there

When the storm is raging
He keeps me free

Shadows dispelling
with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart.

CHORUS
Heavens came down 
and glory filled my soul, 
When at the cross my Saviour 
made me whole, 
My sins were washed away, 
And my night was turned to day 
Heavens came down 
and glory filled my soul.

Born of the spirit with life from above, 
Into God’s family divine, 
Justified fully through calvary’s love, 
Oh what a standing is mine, 
And the transaction so quickly was made, 
When as a sinner I came, 
Took up the offer 
of grace He did offer
He saved me 
0h praise His dear name.

Now I have hope that I'll surely
endure,
After the passing of time,
I have a future in heaven for sure,

And it’s because of that wonderful day,
When at the cross I believed,
Riches eternal and blessing
supernal,
From His precious hand I received."

morning,
With the splendour of the sun,
Came triumphant from the womb,
From the darkness of the tomb
The victory won, hallelujah.

My Lord united out mountains,
With the everlasting hills,
Now the seasons and the seas sing
His song of victory,
Rocks and Hills, hallelujah.

And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity.

Crown Him the Lord of life,
Who triumphed o’er the grave,
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save:
His glories now we sing
Who died, and rose on high;
Who died eternal life to bring,
And lives that death may die.

Crown Him the Lord of love;
Behold His hands and side,
Those wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified:
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends
his burning eye
At mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of peace,
Whose power a sceptre sways
From pole to pole, that wars may
cease,
And all be prayer and praise:
His reign shall know no end,
And round His pierced feet
Fair flowers of Paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown Him the Lord of years,
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime!
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou has died for me:
Thy praise shall never, never fail
Throughout eternity."
444;WHEN HE COMETH;;"When He cometh, when He
cometh,
To take up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.

CHORUS
Like the stars of the morning
His bright crown adorning
They shall shine In their
beauty
Bright gems for His crown.

He will gather; He will gather,
The gems for His kingdom:
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
His loved and His own.

Little children, little children,
Who love their Redeemer,
Are the jewels, precious jewels
His loved and His own."
445;THERE IS A LIFE FOR A LOOK;;"There is life for a look at the
Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee;
Then look, sinner, look unto Him
and be saved,
Unto Him who was nailed to the tree.

CHORUS
Look! look and live! 
There Is life for a look at the 
crucified One, 
There Is life at this moment for thee.

It is not thy tears of repentance 
nor prayers, 
But the blood that atones for the soul;
On Him then believe, 
and a pardon receive, 
For His blood now can 
make thee quite whole.

We are healed by His stripes; 
wouldst thou add to the word?
 And He is our righteousness made;
The best robe of heaven He bids 
thee to wear, 
Oh, couldst thou be better 
arrayed?

Then doubt not thy welcome, 
since God has declared, 
There remaineth no more to be done;
That once in the end of the world 
He appeared,
 And completed the work He’d 
begun.

But take, with rejoicing, from Jesus at 
once, 
The life everlasting He gives;
 And know with assurance thou 
never canst die, 
Since Jesus thy righteousness lives."
446;WILL YOUR ANCHOR HOLD;;"Will your anchor hold 
in the storms of life, 
When the clouds unfold their 
wings of strife? 
When the strong tides lift, 
and the cables strain, 
Will your anchor shift, or firm remain?

CHORUS
We have an anchor that keeps 
the soul 
Steadfast and sure while the billows 
roll, 
Fasten’d to the Rock 
which cannot move, 
Grounded firm and deep in the 
Saviour’s love.

It is safely moor’d ‘twill the storm 
withstand, 
For ‘tis well secured by the Saviour’s 
hand; 
And the cables, pass’d from His 
heart to mine, 
Can defy the blast, thro’ strength divine,

It will firmly hold in the straits of fear, 
When the breakers have told 
the reef is near; 
Tho’ the tempest rave, and the wild 
winds blow, 
Not an angry wave shall our 
barque o’er-flow.

It will surely hold in the floods of death, 
When the waters cold chill 
our latest breath; 
On the rising tide it can never fail, 
While our hopes abide within the veil!"
447;ONE DAY I HEARD A VOICE;;"One day heard a voice saying
Make the Lord your choice,
He’ll take away your every sin
And set you free;
So I came to Him by faith
And He took my sins away,
Now I don’t want nothing here to
hinder me.

CHORUS
I don’t want nothing here 
to binder me
For some day His blessed face 
I long to see
It makes no difference 
what the cost, 
Or how heavy is my cross 
But I don’t want nothing here 
to hinder me.

Many times I’m tossed about, 
Many times I do without; 
And many times I’m burdened 
With a load of care 
But I know if I’ll be true 
Some sweet day He’ll see 
me through
If I don’t let nothing here to 
hinder me."
448;I AM GOING TO A CITY;;"I am going to a city,
Where the streets with gold are laid,
Where the tree of life is blooming;
And the roses never fade.

CHORUS
Here they bloom but for a season
Soon their beauty is decayed,
I am going to a city (am going)
Where the roses never fade.

In this world we have our troubles,
Satan’s snares we must evade,
Will be free from all temptations,
Where the roses never fade.

Loved ones gone to be with Jesus, 
in their robes of white arrayed; 
They are waiting for my coming 
Where the roses never fade.

Abraham who was our father, 
Travelled day by day in faith; 
He was looking for a city, 
Where the roses never fade."
449;BURDENS ARE LIFTED AT CALVARY;;"Days are filled with sorrow and care, 
Hearts are lonely and drear.

CHORUS
Burdens are lifted at calvary
Calvary, calvary
Burdens are lifted at calvary
Jesus Is very near.

Troubled soul the Saviour can see 
All your heartaches and fears.

Cast your care on Jesus today 
Leave your worry and fear."
450;I NEED NO MANSION HERE BELOW;;"When burdens seem so hard to bear;
That no earthly man can share,
Drives away the smiles and leaves
My heart in pain:
But my Father from above,
Speaks to me in tones of love,
Wipes away the tears and
Makes me smile again.

CHORUS
I need no mansion here below
For Jesus said that I would go;
To a home beyond the clouds
Not made with hands,
Won’t you come and go along,
We will sing the sweetest songs,
Ever played upon the harps,
In glory land.

Oh to me the thought is sweet 
That the loved ones I will see, 
At the ending of my journey here below, 
It seems I hear their voices blend, 
In that world without an end
I won’t worry when my time 
has come to go.

When Jesus comes to claim His own,
I will move to my new home;
We’ll talk and walk with Him
Along the streets,
A mansion there is awaiting me:
Soon it’s beauty I shall see,
In that city where we never more
shall roam."
451;KEEP YOUR EYES ON JESUS;;"Struggling through this world
Of sin and sorrow
We’re trusting in Jesus every day
Waiting for a happy bright tomorrow
When Jesus comes to take
His bride away.

CHORUS
Keep your eyes on Jesus
When the tides and waves of
troubles round you roll
He will calm the toils of life
That toss your soul.

When the life you live is not 
worthy living,
know one who cares and 
understands, 
He will cleanse your heart and 
make you happy
 And lead you to that home not 
made with hands."
452;I’VE BEEN TO CALVARY;;"I’ve never travelled far around 
the world, 
I’ve never seen so many things 
And thrills afar 
But I have taken a journey of 
journeys for me; 
Up calvary’s mountain 
There my saviour to see.

CHORUS
I’ve been to calvary,
I can say I’ve seen the Lord
I’ve been to calvary,
Through the witness of
His Word,
Each day at calvary,
What a thrill of joy divine
Just to know, that the
Saviour Is mine.

I walked up calvary’s road,
Where Jesus trod;
I saw Him hanging there,
The Son of God,
With tear strained eyes
I knelt and prayed
‘Jesus save my soul
Oh praise the Lord,
I’m glad I’ve been to calvary."
453;I’LL LIVE THE WAY HE WANTS ME;;"CHORUS
I’m gonna live the way 
He wants me to live 
I’m gonna give until there’s 
 just no more to give 
I’m gonna love, love till there’s 
 just no more love, 
I could never ever out 
 love the Lord.

Many times in loving and giving 
 brought pain, 
And I promised I’d never 
 let it happen again
And I found out that loving was 
 worth all there is 
And rather give in, 
 to losing my way.

He showed us that only through 
dying we live, 
And He gave when it seemed 
there was nothing to give 
He loved when loving brought 
heartache and pain 
And He forgave, from an old 
rugged cross."
454;WATCH AND PRAY THE LORD IS COMING;;"The scene now is setting,
The time is drawing nigh,
When the Lord said He’s coming
Like a thief in the night;
He wants us to get ready
It may be just any day
For the Master now is waiting
For the bride to watch and pray.

CHORUS
Watch and pray the Lord is coming, 
Watch and pray; 
He’s waiting for His children 
to get desperate and say 
Oh Jesus please come quickly 
For there is no other way 
For the spirit now is calling, 
Oh my brother watch and pray.

The message has been given
Elijah now is gone
We are waiting for the secret
catching of the Bride away
It may be any moment
In the morning, night or noon
But the Bridegroom is just waiting
For the bride to watch and pray."
455;I MUST HAVE THE SAVIOUR WITH ME;;"I must have the Saviour with me,
For I dare not walk alone,
I must feel His presence near me,
And His arm around me thrown.

CHORUS
Then my soul shall fear no ill
Let Him lead me where He will
I will go without a murmur,
And His footsteps follow still.

I must have the Saviour with me,
For my faith, at best, is weak;
He can whisper words of comfort,
That no other voice can speak.

I must have the Saviour with me,
In the onward march of life’
Through the tempest and the sunshine,
Through the battle and the strife.

I must have the Saviour with me,
And His eye the way must guide,
Till I reach the vale of Jordan,
Till I cross the rolling tide."
456;BEYOND TOMORROW;;"I long to gain my treasures waiting,
Up on the other shore,
Beyond tomorrow,
Beyond tomorrow,
A land without a heavy burden;
Where dear ones for us wait,
Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow.

CHORUS
Beyond tomorrow
My skies will all be blue
Beyond tomorrow
My dreams come true
There’ll be no sorrow
Beyond tomorrow
For Christ will be with me
Throughout eternity.

A starry crown and robes of glory,
Are waiting there for me,
Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow
But most of all the face of Jesus
Is what I want to see,
Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow.

Just over chilly Jordan river,
Inside the pearly gates,
Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow
A land without a heavy burden
Where dear ones for us wait,
Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow."
457;I HAVE A HOME BEYOND THE RIVER;;"Oh the blessed contemplation
When with trouble here I sigh
I have a home beyond the river;
That I’ll enter by and by.

CHORUS
I have a home beyond the river
I have a mansion bright and fair
I have a home beyond the river;
I will dwell with Jesus there

Oh how sweet ‘twill be to
meet there,
All the ransomed hosts above;
Sweeter still to see the Saviour,
Praise Him for redeeming love.

Tho’ the world is filled with sorrows,
And the teardrops often fall;
There will be but joy and gladness,
Safe inside the jasper wall.

Tho’ the hills are rough and stormy
And the valleys dark and cold;
I must walk the path before me;
It will some day turn to gold."
458;IT’S HARVEST TIME;;"CHORUS
It’s harvest time and I can hear 
the combine coming, 
To gather in the grain 
and take it home;
The tares will all be burned 
because God’s Word says so 
I’m so glad aren’t you glad too 
it’s harvest time.

Now God sent us a prophet 
In this end-time age, 
To tell us of the coming 
of the Lord 
He said we must go back 
to our fathers faith, 
Or we’ll perish with the 
guilty if we fail


Now it seems there’s a lot of 
action all around us, 
And the people will say why do 
you stand so still, 
If they’d only know the message 
of the hour, 
They’d know we're wheat 
that's ripening in the Master’s field."
459;I SAW THE LORD;;"In the temple of the Lord,
In the year King Uzziah died,
The prophet in great sorrow,
Sought God’s peace to find
As he raised his voice in anguish
All at once Isaiah cried,
It’s the Lord I see lifted up and
seated high.

CHORUS
I saw the Lord, I saw the Lord,
He was high and lifted up
And His train filled the temple
The angels cried, holy,
Yes, the angels cried holy,
All the angels cried holy Is
the Lord.

And today my friend and brother,
And my sister who’ve seen the light,
You may have a friend Uzziah
From whom the Lord still hides
It may be your wealth or fortune
Or ambitions but till they’ve died
You can never like Isaiah
Lift your head and cry."
460;NEVER A MAN SPAKE LIKE THAT;;"Jesus went to the temple
When He was only twelve
His words startled the elders
As His wisdom they beheld;
And the multitude that followed
To hear the man from Galilee
Never a man spake like this man
When He said ‘Come follow me”.

CHORUS
Never a man spake like this man
The glorious King of Kings
He spake to my troubled soul
And now my heart sings
He has promised in His Holy Word
Some day His face I’ll see
Never a man spake like this man
When He said come follow me

He calmed the troubled waters
With a few words from His lips
The lame walked, the dumb talked
When He said to them be healed:
And Lazarus came forth from
the grave
When he heard the Master speak
Never a man spake like this man
When He said ‘come follow me."
461;WHISPERING HOPE;;"Soft as the voice of an angel,
Breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over
Wait till the tempest is done
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow
After the shower is gone.

CHORUS
Whispering hope how welcome
Thy voice
Oh how welcome Thy voice
Making my heart In it's sorrow
rejoice.

If in the dusk of the twilight
Dim be the region afar,
Will not the deepening darkness
brighten
The glimmering star?
Then when the night is upon us;
Why should the heart sink away?
When the dark midnight is over
Watch for the breaking of the day.

Hope as an anchor so steadfast
Rends the dark veil for the soul
Whither the Master has entered,
Robbing the grave of its goal.
Come then, O come glad fruition,
Come to my sad weary heart,
come,
Never O never depart."
462;DO YOU KNOW MY JESUS!;;"Have you a heart that’s weary,
Tending a load of care? 
Are you a soul that’s seeking 
rest from the burdens your bear?

CHORUS
Do you know my Jesus?
Do you know my friend?
Have you heard He loves you,
And that He will abide till the
end.

Where is your light Oh pilgrim?
What does your light reveal?
Who hears your call for comfort?
When naught but sorrow you feel.

Who knows your disappointments
Who hears each time you cry
Who understands your heartaches
Who drives the tears from your eyes"
463;TEARS ARE A LANGUAGE;;"Often you’ve wondered why
 Tears come into your eyes,
 And burdens seem to be much more
Than you can stand, 
But God is standing near, 
He sees your falling tears 
Tears are a language
 that God understands.

CHORUS
God sees the tears of a broken 
heart and soul, 
He sees your tears and hears 
them when they fall, 
God weeps along with man 
and takes him by the hand,
Tears are a language that 
God understands.

When grief has left you low,
It causes tears to flow
And things have not turned out
The way you have planned,
But God won’t forget you,
His promises are true,
Tears are a language
that God understands."

Oh, come angel band
Come and around me spread
Bear me away on
your snowy wings 
To my immortal home
Bear me away in
your snowy wings 
To my immortal home

I know I'm near the holy ranks
Of friends and kindred dear
I hear the waves on Jordan's banks
The crossing must be near

I've almost reached 
my heavenly home
My spirit loudly sings
The holy ones behold they come
I hear the noise of wings

Oh bear my longing heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now 
cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory"
991;BWANA NI MCHUNGAJI WANGU;;"Bwana ni mchungaji wangu
 Sitapungukiwa kitu
Hun'laza penye majani mabichi, 
huniongoza kwa maji matulivu
Huihuisha nafsi yangu,
 huniongoza kwa njia za haki
Nipitapo bondeni mwa mauti,

992;CHILD OF THE LIGHT;;"Stumbling Alone
 In The Darkness,
I Was Searching For A Light To Shine,
Searching For The Source Of Revelation
To Fill This Darkened Heart Of Mine
Oh The Greatest Mystery 
This World Has Ever Known
Became So Clear To Me
When The Light Of God's Word,
Shined Into My Heart
And Now My Blinded Eyes Can See

Chorus
And Now I See Myself,
Like My Father Does,
Am Not Of The Darkness, Like I Was,
For He Changed Me, 
When His Light Came In,
No Longer In The Night 
Am A Child Of The Light
I've Been Born Again

So Many Are Wandering
In Darkness,
They're Children Of The Night,
They Need A Glorious Transformation
From The Kingdom Of Darkness To Light
For Many Years Ago
On Resurrection Day,
Jesus The Light Broke Through,
To Provide Us A Way, 
From Night Into Day,
A Path Of Life For Me And For You."

994;The Conflict of Ages;;"The conflict of ages are upon us
This unbiblical distorted thing we call church
That mixes with the world
and dishonours its so called Lord
has been found out for what it is, a fraud.

The True Church is born from above
In It there are no sinners and
outside of It there are no saints
No man can write another's name on Its members roll
And no man can cross another's name off that roll
Bless the Lord there is still a small remnant in the world-
lives and moves and has its being in prayer
Prayer is the soul's sincere desire.

This is an hour in need of burning hearts
bursting lips, and burning eyes
If we were a tenth as spiritual as we think we are
our streets will be filled 
each sunday with throngs of believers
Marching to Zion, shaking the calamity
that has brought the Church
to be the unlovely, unnerved,
unproductive thing that she is.

If we wept as much in the prayer closet
as devout Jews have done
at the wailing wall in Jerusalem
we would now be enjoying
a prevailing, purging revival!
If we would return to apostolic practice-
waiting upon the Lord for apostolic power 
we could then go fourth to apostolic possibilities
This is the hour when we are asked 
over and over again by our pastor and
foreign preachers to go back to our knees
For God is about to do so in the meeting 
hoping to bring back revival.

Church we surely need again to climb 
Calvary's hill on our knees,
to survey the wondrous cross in an attitude
of humiliation and adoration
The Church must first weep; 
then our altars will be filled with weeping penitents."
995;HOW SWEET THE NAME OF JESUS;;"How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds
And drives away his fears

It makes the wounded spirit whole
And calms the troubled breast
'Tis a manna to the hungry soul
And to every weary rest.

Dear Name, the Rock on which I build
My shield and my hiding place
My never-failing Treasury,
Filled with boundless stores of grace

Jesus, my Shepherd, Saviour, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest and King,
My Lord, my Life, my Way , my End
Accept the praise I bring

I would Thy boundless love proclaim
With every fleeting breath;
So shall the music of Thy Name
Refresh my soul in death."
996;IT'S JESUS I REALLY WANT TO SEE;;"I've truly known a good life 
Filled with family and friends
I've been blest, with more than my 
share
But with all my good fortunes
My heart is sinking still, 
Oh I just  can't deny the longing in 
there.

Chorus
It's Jesus I really want to see(x2)
The more I see of this world the less
it means to me, and its Jesus,
I really want to see.

I've been to lots of places,
And I've known the great and small
I've seen the grand and noble works 
of men but in the heart of my heart
I know there's more for me,
so much more than this fading 
world am in"
997;I'M HAPPY TODAY;;"I'm happy today so happy
in Jesus name I'm happy (because)
He has taken away my sins away 
I'm happy so happy today

The time to be happy is now

on the mountain
And you've got peace of mind,
like you've never known.
But things change, when
you're down in the valley
Don't lose faith, for you're
never alone.

Chorus
For the God on the mountain,
is still the God in the valley.
When things go wrong, He'll
make them right
And the God of the good times
is still God in the bad times.
The God of the day is
still God in the night.

We talk of faith 
when you are up on the mountain.
Talk comes so easy when
life's at its best.
Now down in the valleys, of
trials and temptations
That's where your faith,
is really put to the test."

Lord We Don't Understand Why 
You've Waited So Long

He's Still On Time

Jesus Said to Martha Show Me The Grave,
But She Said Lord You Don't Understand 
He's Been There Four Days
The Grave Stone Was Rolled Back,
Then Jesus Cried 'Lazarus Come Forth'
Then Somebody Said
He's Alive, He's Alive!

You May Be Fighting A Battle Of Fear
You've Cried To The Lord
I Need You Now

ocean to me,
And if my heart were a
window that you could look
through all the pain 
And scars you would see

Chorus
But tears will never stain 
The streets of that City
No wreaths of death 
on my mansion door
Teardrops aren't welcome
beyond the Gates of Glory
Cause the heart will never
break anymore

I'd questioned the loss
of a loved one,
The grave seems 
final and cold,
Oh, but will meet again, 
Where death has no victory,
In a land where
we'll never grow old.

Well I've never met
one man without sorrow
Never looked into eyes
with no pain
But I know a land where
grief is a total stranger
And songs of joy are the
only songs they sing"

The Cross I Will Stay"
1012;WHEN HE WAS ON THE CROSS;;"I’m not on an ego trip I’m
Nothing on my own
I made mistakes I often slip
Just common flesh and bones
But I’ll prove someday just why I say
I’m of a special kind
For when He was on the cross
I was on His mind.

Chorus
He knew me, yet He loved me
He whose glory makes the
heavens shine
So unworthy of such mercy
Yet when He was on the Cross
I was on His mind.

The look of love was on His face
Thorns were on His head
The Blood was on His scarlet robe
Stained a crimson red
Though His eyes were on
The crowd that day
He looked ahead in time
For when He was on the Cross
I was on His mind."

Through His Saving Power.

By His Wonderful Grace.
I’m So Glad That I Found Out
He Could Bring Me Out And
Show Me The Way.

That Has Taken Its Flight;
Like A Blind Man That God
Gave Back His Sight.

He Could Bring Me Out
Thro’ His Holy Name."

Making Sunshine All The Way!

Then He’ll Lead Me In The Right,
Help Me Win Lost Souls For Heaven
Out Of Darkness Into Light.

Oh, I Have The Love Of Jesus! 
Praise His Name, I Know Him Well!
And I Love To Sing His Praises

Down in an old country farm, 
Wed go to church on Sunday 
And id hear the preacher say, 
If you want to see my Jesus,
You got to stay on the King's highway, 
This highway leads to glory, 

And its not an easy ride,
You'll find all kinds of excuse
To throw you off your side, 
Some will lead to fortune,
others lead to fame, 
Some will lead you so 
far off you won't return again

Oh you got to stay 
between the white line
Oh be on the right side, 
keep you eyes open, 
All the time, you got to stay
 between the white line
Never ride on the yellow line, 
And you'll get to heaven right on time.

Satan's on this highway, 
He walks on every side, 
Trying to flag you down, 
Don't give him a ride, 
He will try to stop you,
at just any cost,
You may stop too long, 
and your soul may be lost"

And Knowing That God's Love

Facing The Shame 
Of Failures And Regrets,
Leaving Us Empty, Broken,

I want to stroll over Heaven 
with you some glad day 
When all our troubles and 
heartaches are vanished away

where all things are new

So many places of beauty

But time and treasures have
kept us from making plans as you know
But come the morning of the rapture

While I stroll over Heaven with you"

If I, had my life to live over,

But I can't live my life over

I can't undo what wrongs I've done
Can't change it in the slightest way
I can't live my life over
Can't correct one single

But I'll give Christ

Not another day, goes by,

Oh I remember every wrong thing I've done
Satan, won't let me forget 
All the times I've let Jesus down
But I've always wanted 
to be a real christian,
Though I didn't heed,

If I had my Iife to live over,
I'd stay here behind, God's Holy Word."

Trusting that I'd get across.

Believing that I'd never get lost.

Knowing I'd have the strength for the climb
'Cause through every trial, each test and temptation,
One thing is sure every time

Chorus
Over and over, again and again,
God is faithful.
Over and over, again and again,
Through it all He's made me able
To stand and survive, to come through alive
When it sure looked like I couldn't win.
Jesus is with me so I claim the victory
Over and over again.

If you ask me why I have no hesitation,
God does what He says He will do.
I'd simply say every battle has taught me
There's nothing He won't help me through.
So why should I dwell on the hardships and struggles

Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over The Hills And Everywhere
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
That Jesus Christ Is Born.

While Shepherds Kept Their Watching
Over Silent Flocks By Night
Behold Throughout The Heavens
There Shone A Holy Light.

The Shepherds Feared And Trembled,
When Lo! Above The Earth,
Rang Out The Angels Chorus

of Your Cares On Him. 

Do You Feel That The Lord 
Has Forgotten Your Need.

Working In Ways You Cannot See."

1084;HE SAID THAT I COULD GO FREE;;"Lock me up in a prison
And throw away the key
Take away my vision
From these eyes that now, now can see
Then deprive me of the food I eat
And even bind my hands and feet
For as long as I know my Jesus
Then I could still go free

CHORUS
He said that I could still go free
What kind of man would reach down 
his hand and do this for me
So unworthy to live and not fit to kill
But a man on the cross had my 
name in His will
And He said that I could still go free

Now I never could quite understand 
why a king would want to leave His throne
To dawn the robe of an earthly man 
and feel the pain of flesh, flesh and bone
Then to later trod that lonely path
That led to Calvary
But those blood red stains broke all 
my chains
So that I could still go free"

for my journey now

Chorus
Well I wouldn't take nothin' 
for my journey now
I'm gonna make It to Heaven somehow

He's offered everything that's got a name
All the wealth I want and worldly fame
If I could

Drawn me far from you

Help me love you again

I have longed to know you and 
Your tender mercies
Like a river of forgiveness, 
Ever flowing without end

Goodness of your presence
Your grace forever shining like a beacon

Sending His angels fighting from all sides

how vast beyond all measure,
that he should give his only son
to make a wretch his treasure.
how great the pain of searing loss-
the Father's turns His face away,
as wounds which mar the chosen one
bring many sons to glory.

Behold the Man upon the cross,
my sins upon His shoulders;
ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
call out among the scoffers.
it was my sin that held Him there
until it was accomplished;
His dying breath has brought me life-
I know that it is finished.

I will not boast in anything
no gifts, no power, no wisdom;
but I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer;
But this I know with all my heart-
His wounds have paid my ransom."

CHORUS
And I'll have eyes that
Will never fill with teardrops 
I'll have legs that
Will never ache with pain
I'll have hands that
Will never age and wither
And a heart that will never break again

I have often heard 
and read about that city
Where with Jesus 
we shall live forevermore
There a mansion's 
in construction for my dwelling
And the streets of gold 
will run by my front door

And all the eyes of the blind 
will then be opened
And they'll join the victory
 march with the lamb,
And the deaf whose never heard
 the roll of thunder,
Will rejoice to hear 
the Saviour call his name."

That it's not long
till we be changed just like they are
To a body pure and free :immortality
What a day what a day thats gonna be

Someday rainbows will sweep the sky
There'll be a trumpet sound
The dead in christ will be coming out
Oh how you'll want him 
you better want him now 
For after awhile it will be too late

Or life forever if I go
Praise the Lord,
I'm a winner either way!

None of us really know about tomorrow
So we must prepare to go to 
Heaven any day
While we're here, just trust the Lord
He'll lead us there for our reward
By His grace, we'll be a winner either way!"
1123;I DON'T REGRET A MILE;;"I don't regret a mile, 
I've  travelled for the Lord
I don't regret the times,
I've trusted in His Word 
I've seen the years go by,
Many days without a song 
But I don't regret a mile,
I've  travelled for the Lord

I've dreamed many a dream 
that's never come true,
I've seen them vanish at dawn
But enough of my dreams
have come true
To make me keep dreaming on

I've prayed many a prayer 
That seemed no answer 
would come,
Though I'd waited so patient
and long
But enough prayers have 
come to my answers
To make me keep praying on.

I've sown many a seed
That's fallen by the wayside
For the birds to feed upon
But I've held enough sheaves in 
my hands
To make me keep sowing on.

I've trusted many a friend
That's failed me
And left me to weep alone,
But enough of my friends
Have been true-blue
To make me keep trusting on.

I've drained the cup of 
disappointment and pain
And gone many a day 
without a song
But I've sipped enough nectar
from roses of life,
To make me want to live on."
1125;GIVE ME A HEART LIKE THINE;;"Give me a heart that knows no ill
Give me the grace to do Thy will
Pardon and cleanse this soul of mine
Give me a heart like Thine

Come to my soul, blessed Jesus
Hear me Oh Saviour Divine
Open the fountain and cleanse
me within
Give me a heart like thine

Only a joy a few brief tears
Only a dream a well of tears
Vain is this world Lord I resign
Lord give me a heart like Thine"
1126;I WILL SERVE THEE;;"I will serve Thee because I love Thee
You have given life to me
I was nothing before you found me
You have given life to me

Heartaches, broken pieces 
Ruined lives are why you died 
on Calvary
Your touch was what I longed for 
You have given life to me"
1127;SAVED BY GRACE;;"Chorus
Saved by grace, I've been saved by grace
My name is in the book of life
And my sins are washed away
Saved by grace, I've been saved by grace
It's not what I deserved but am 
saved by grace

I was alone in the darkness
I could not find my way
Jesus shined the Light on me
And turned my night to day

When I reach that city
The gates swing wide open 
Am gonna sing redemption story
Of how He turned my night to day"
1128;I'M A PART OF THE FAMILY OF GOD;;"You will notice we say brother
and sister round here
It's because we're family and these
are so near
When one has a heartache we all 
share the tears
And rejoice in victory in this 
family so dear

Chorus
I'm so glad I'm part of the family of God
I've been washed in the fountain and 
cleansed in His blood
Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod
For I'm part of the Family,
The Family of God

From the door of an orphanage
to the house of a King
No longer an outcast, a new song I sing
From rags unto riches, from the weak 
to the strong
I'm not worthy to be here but praise 
God I belong"
1129;LORD FEED YOUR CHILDREN;;"My vessel is empty 
Where once I had plenty
My soul is barren and dry
Oh! But somewhere flows a fountain
Beyond distant mountain 
Let me drink from the river of life

CHORUS
Lord feed your children
As we stand here willing
To eat from the table of Life
Let me drink from the fountain 
That flows from the mountain
Let me feast from the Father's supply

So long I have hungered
No man could number
The days that I longed to be
In a land filled with honey
Where the rivers are running
Very soon I'll taste and I'll see"
1130;LEAVING HERE;;"I've got a brand new touch
From the Lord whose in our midst
His word has come forth
powerful He's quickened it to me
The seventh angel's message
Which was spoken in this 
last day, was to cloth 
the Bride in garments
(for that) catching away

CHORUS
(Am feeling like) leaving here
(Am feeling like) going home
All my treasures are laid up
on the other side
With my Lord and Saviour
and loved ones all around
(Am feeling like) leaving here
(Praise God am..) Going home

(That sweet presence that you feel)..
is Jesus Christ Himself
He has come fourth in this hour
With victory and power
All the mysteries are clear
Our redemption draweth nigh
All the seals have been loosed
(and I'm) ready to move"
464;JESUS IS PLEADING WITH MY SOUL;;"Jesus is pleading with my poor soul, 
Shall I be saved to-night? 
If I believe, He will make me whole, 
Shall I be saved to-night? 
Tenderly, sadly, I hear Him say, 
How can you grieve me from 
day to day?
Shall I go on in the old, old way, 
Or shall I be saved to-night?

Jesus was nail’d to the cross for me,
Shall I be saved to-night?
How can my heart so ungrateful be?
Shall I be saved to-night?
Now He will save me by grace divine,
Now, if I will, I make Him mine,
Can I the pleasure of earth resign?
Shall I be saved to-night?

Jesus is knocking at my poor heart,
Shall I be saved to-night?
What if His Spirit should now depart?
Shall I be saved to-night?
Over and over His voice I hear,
Sweetly it falls on my list’ning ear:
Shall I reject Him a friend so dear?
Oh, shall I be saved to-night?

What if that voice I should hear
no more?
Shall I be saved to-night?
Quickly I’ll open this bolted door,
Save me, 0 Lord to-night!
Blessed Redeemer, come in, come in,
Pity my sorrow, forgive my sin!
Now let Thy work in my soul begin,
For I will be saved to-night!"
465;HAVE YOU BEEN RESTORED;;"Living under the Lambs shed blood
As the star shines through the way
I will take my stand with Jesus my
Lord,
Clinging to the Holy Word,
Yielding all my life to Jesus,
I will live under the blood.

CHORUS
Have you been restored 
Back to the holy faith Hear the voice, 
the bridegroom cometh, 
Have you seen the evening light.

Great rivers of joy in men
And tears flow in my eyes
The battle of flesh and spirit in me
Treading on forsaken path
It’s by faith I’ll trail to glory,
Praying in the Holy Ghost.

I’ll yield my all to Christ
My sword His Holy Word
And my ladder and ark to float up
above
May He help me to obey
Built upon apostles and prophets
Jesus Christ the corner stone.

When He comes to take me 
home
 I will sing the triumph song
 A home beyond my words 
to describe
The Son of David reigning in the 
everlasting Kingdom 
We shall never part again."
466;A PRISONER OF LOVE;;"When I came to Jesus 
I settled it all
I gave Him my life to control 
Neither fear nor persuasion,could draw 
me to Christ
But His love has captured my soul.

CHORUS
I’m a prisoner of love 
I'm a slave to my Master 
I willingly toil through the heat and 
the cold; 
I seek no reward in this world below
But the pay day will come, 
Oh Yes! When the pearly gates unfold.

He holds me secure with His
love strong and true
I'm happy His servant to be 
If bondaged to Jesus forever 
I’ll stay
My soul doesn't want to be free."
467;HE DOES NOT COMPEL US TO GO;;"When the Canaanites 
hardened their hearts against God
And grieved Him because 
of their Sins
God sent along hornets to 
bring them to terms
And help His own people to win 
The hornets persuaded 
them that it was best
To go quickly and not to go slow
 God did not compel them to 
go against their will
But He just made them willing to go.

CHORUS
God does not compel 
us to go (anywhere)
He does not compel us 
to go (oh no)
God does not compel us to 
go against our will
But He just makes us willing to go.

If a nest of live hornets were 
sent to this room
And the creatures 
allowed to go free
You would not need urging 
to make yourself scared
You would want to get out don’t you see
They would not hold or by force of
 their strength
 Throw you out of the window, Oh, no!
They would not compel you to go
against your will
 They would just make you willing to go.

When Jonah was sent to 
the work of the Lord
The outlook was not very bright
 He did not need urging to make 
himself scared
So he packed and ran off from the fight
But God sent a big fish to swallow him up
The story I’m sure you all know 
God did not compel him to go 
against his will, 
But He just made him willing to go."
468;FOR THOSE TEARS I DIED;;"You said you’d come
To share all my sorrows
You said you’d be there,
For all my tomorrow;
I came so close to sending you
away
But just like you promised
You came here to stay
I just had to pray.

Chorus
And Jesus said come to the
waters
Stand by my side,
I know you’re thirsty
You won’t be denied
I felt every tear drop
When in darkness you cried
And I strove to remind you,
That for those tears I died.

Your goodness so great,
I can’t understand,
And dear Lord I know,
That all this was planned
I know you’re here now
And always will be;
Your love loosed my chains
And now I am free
But Jesus why me?

Saviour I give you
My life and my soul,
I know that without God,
I’d never be whole,
Saviour you opened all the right
doors
And I thank you and praise you
From earth’s humble shores
Take me I’m yours."
469;THERE IS A HAPPY LAND;;"There is a happy land,
Far, far, away
Where saints in glory stand,
Bright, bright as day
Oh how sweetly they sing
“Worthy is our Saviour King!”
Loud let His praises ring
Praise, praise for aye.

Come to this happy land
Come, come away;
Why will ye doubting stand?
Why still delay?
Oh we shall happy be,
When, from sin and sorrow free,
Lord, we shall live with Thee
Blest, blest for aye.

Bright in that happy land
Beams e’very eye
Kept by a father’s hand
Love cannot die;
On, then, to glory run;
Be a crown and kingdom won;
And, bright above the sun,
Reign, reign for aye."
470;HOLDING MY HAND;;"Lord you gave me a life 
without sorrow
And a home where my problems 
are few, 
But should it all fall in pieces 
tomorrow, 
I just want to know 
that I have you.

CHORUS
Holding my hand Like you only 
can hold it 
Whispering peace, 
like no other can do
I won’t worry for fame and 
fortune
If I only know that I have you.

At last when this life is all over 
And Jordan chilly waters I view 
And no matter who is 
standing around me
(Lord) I would like to 
know that I have you."
471;HAVE YOU HEARD THE SHOUT?;;"chorus;
How many times must a 
man hear God’s call 
Before he’ll turn away from sins, 
How many times can you reject 
God’s word
Before He’ shuts the
door on you?
My friend  do you realise 
God’s spirit won’t always strive
God’s spirit won’t always 
strive with man.

Have you heard the shout, 
as it went out loud and clear,
Come out from among them 
my friends, 
Don’t partake of their creeds 
The mysteries have been revealed, 
It’s evening time, 
keep your lamps trimmed and clear.

Through the mouth of the prophet, 
God has spoken once again, 
Repent repent of all of your sins 
Be baptized in Jesus Name 
For His power is still the same 
Just believe the promise 
given to you."
472;SUCH WONDERFUL LOVE;;"Oh the right road I’ve travelled
Since Jesus came in
Took away all my sins,
He gladly bore the shame
When they nailed Him to the cross
He never counted the cost
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah
Oh that love He had for us.

CHORUS
Such love, such wonderful love,
I was lost, condemned to die,
When He reached down His
hand for me
He took my place at Calvary.

When they stood all around Him,
And accused Him of sin,
They mocked Him and smote Him
And cursed His holy Name.
Yet He stood there like a lamb
Not one word to defend;
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah,
All glory to the Lamb."
473;COME WALK WITH ME;;"Along life's road I stumbled in 
the darkness
My blinded eyes had caused 
my feet to roam, 
I met the Lord who spoke to me 
so sweetly, 
Come walk with me and 
now you will see home.

CHORUS
Come walk with me
The way Is strait and narrow
Come walk with me,
You cannot walk alone;
For the road Is rough
And there are many dangers
Come walk with me
And I will see you home.

So now I walk with Christ
My blessed Saviour
I need not fear for I am not alone
He guides me through this life
With all it's sorrows,
And some day soon
He’ll see me safely home."
474;JESUS HOLD MY HAND;;"As I travel through this pilgrim land
There is a friend who walks with me:
Leads me safely through the
sinking sand
It is the Christ of Calvary,
This would be my prayer dear Lord
each day
To help me do the best I can
As I need Thy light to guide me
Day and night
Precious Jesus hold my hand.

CHORUS
Jesus hold my hand,
I need Thee every hour
Through this pilgrim land,
Oh! help me by Thy power
Hear my feeble plea oh dear
Lord
Look down on me
When I kneel In prayer
I hope to meet you there;
Blessed Jesus hold my hand.

Let me travel in Thy light divine
That I may see Thy blessed way
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing redemption song some day
I will be a soldier brave and true;
And ever firmly take a stand:
As I onward go and daily meet the
foe
Blessed Jesus hold my hand.

When I wander thro’ the 
valley of death
Towards the setting of the sun,
 Lead me safely to the land of rest 
To wear a crown of life I’ve won; 
I here put my faith on 
Thee dear Lord
That I may reach that golden strand, 
There's no other friend on whom I 
can depend 
Blessed Jesus hold my hand."
475;NEARER TO THEE;;"I have a longing in this heart of mine,
I want to be, yes to be nearer to
Thee,
I would be holy for I would be Thine
Draw me I pray, day after day
Nearer to Thee.

CHORUS
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Oh grant It Lord, grant it Lord
This is my plea; I want to stay
In heaven’s fair land where I
Will be,
Where I’ll be nearer to Thee.

Being firm and faithful, 
by faith I’ll be home
Some happy day, yes some day, 
On heavenly shore, 
and I shall walk
On streets of pure gold where 
we’ll all live
Nearer to Thee."
476;I HOPE TO BE IN THAT MEETING;;"I am longing for the morning, 
The day of the rapture
 When Jesus will take home His bride,
 To the place prepared to live eternally
 I hope to be there in that meeting.

CHORUS
Oh, Lord take my hand,
This Is my plea
And lead me safely home,
Let me not miss it Lord
But be there in that meeting.

Now the prophet has gone,
And our days here are numbered
Dear pilgrim don’t loose your vision,
Just a few more days to wait for
His coming,
Press on pilgrim to the rapture.

I'll cling to Jesus my only hope 
and guide, 
This world cannot hold me no longer, 
I’m going home that precious 
land above, 
Oh precious are the memories 
of my home above.

My heart keeps longing to get 
the great reward, 
That awaits the faithful, 
in that glorious land,
 Lord lead me through,
 I’ll trust They Word, 
Till I reach home above 
and see Thy face."
477;THERE’S A LIGHT AT THE RIVER FOR ME;;"There’s a deep silent river 
flowing just beyond, 
And it’s waters are deep and wide, 
But faith sees the Light yes, 
its definite Light, 
Just down by the river side.

CHORUS
There’s a Light at the river,
A Light at the river,
There’s a Light at the river I
can see,
My Lord will stand and hold In
His hand,
A Light at the river for me.

To this deep silent river, 
I have come on my knees, 
I’m afraid for I know I have sinned; 
But the beckoning Light, 
leads me on through the night, 
To the waters where my soul 
may be cleansed.

To that deep silent river we will one 
day stand, 
And we’ll cross over waters so wide 
But He’ll carry us away to the 
realms of the day, 
To our home on the other side.

Many dear ones have gathered,
Safe just before the Throne,
Dip their wings on the misty tide,
They’ll pass over deeps and will
never grow weak,
In their home on the other side."
478;HE LEADETH ME!;;"He leadeth me! O, blessed thought
Oh, words with heavenly 
comfort fraught!
What’er I do, where’er I be,
Still ‘tis God’s hand 
that leadeth me!

CHORUS
He leadeth me! He leadeth me 
By His own hand He leadeth me!
His faithful follower I would be 
For by His hand He leadeth me

Sometimes ‘mid scenes 
of deepest gloom, 
Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom, 
By waters still, o’er troubled sea, 
Still ‘tis His hand that leadeth me!

Lord, I would place my hands in
Thine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine;
Content, whatever lot I see, 
Since ‘tis my God that leadeth me.

And when my task on earth is done,
 When, by Thy grace, the victory’s won, 
E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee; 
Since Thou through Jordan leadest me."
479;TO SEE THE SEA WALKER;;"When I go to see my Saviour 
On that fair and distant Throne,
 And am free from things in life that
make me sin,
There’ll be someone there to meet 
and greet me at the door,
 Open wide these pearly gates 
Am coming through!

CHORUS
To see the sea walker,
The blind man healer,
The leper cleansing Man of
Galilee
I’ll see the soul Saviour,
The one who set me free,
Open wide these pearly gates
Am coming through!

All my friends and my relations 
Will be waiting there I pray; 
And my dear mother will be 
waiting there too;
Am getting ready brother tell me 
how things there will be;
Open wide these pearly gates 
Am coming through!"
480;LAST NIGHT AS I LAY SLEEPING;;"Last night as I lay sleeping 
A dream came to me, 
I dreamt about the end of time 
and about eternity;
I saw a million sinners fall on 
their faces to pray, 
The Saviour sadly shook 
His head, 
And this I heard Him say:

Sorry, I never knew you,
Depart from me for ever more;
Sorry, I never knew you,
Go and serve the one that you
served before.

I thought the times had fully come
When I must stand the trial,
I told the Lord that I had been a
Christian all the while;
Then through the Book He
carefully looked
And sadly shook His head:
He placed me over on His left
And this is what He said:

Sorry, I never knew you,
I find no record of your work;
Sorry, I never knew you,
Go and serve the one that you
served all the while.

There was my wife and children
I heard each one’s voice,
They must have been so happy -
It seemed they did rejoice
With robes of white all round them
And crowns upon their heads;
My little girl looked up to me
And this is what she said:

Daddy, we can’t go with you, 
We must dwell in the joys of our Lord;
Sorry, but we still love you - 
But you’ll never be our 
daddy any more.

When from sleep I awakened with
tears in my eyes,
I looked around about me,
And to my great surprise,
I saw my wife and babies,
And knew I had a dream;
And down beside my bed I fell
And poured my sins’ history.

Father, who art in heaven,
In mercy look on me today,
Forgive me and let me serve You,
Till Thy Son has come and
carries me away."
481;HE SAVES, HE KEEPS, HE SATISFIES;;"He saves, He keeps, He satisfies,
This wonderful Saviour of mine,

This wonderful Saviour of mine!"

He is the Christ that changes not.

He is the Lord, He changes not."
483;HOW GOOD IS THE GOD WE ADORE!;;"How good is the God we adore,
Our faithful, unchangeable Friend,
Whose love is as great as His power,

We’ll praise Him for all that is past,
And trust Him for all that’s to come."

Treads a diferent path,

That all may know,

CHORUS
They are watching you
Marking all you do
Hearing the things you say
Let them see the Saviour as
He shines in you
Let His power control you
every day.

Men will look, at the life I lead 
See the things I take, 
and the things I love, 
They judge my Lord by my 
every deed
Lord, set my affection on
 things above.

Here on earth, people walk in 
the night
With no light to guide, they are 
dead in sin
I know the Lord, who can give
them light

within."

To which I’ve never been before
No sad goodbye will there be spoken

There’s just a few more days to labour
And I will take my heavenly flight."

a mighty mountain,

the troubled sea;
Faith in God makes sweet the 
bitter fountain, 
Faith can give the victory,

Lord,
We really want to bless your
Name,
Hallelujah, Jesus is our King

together,
To live and to move in the love of
Christ;
Tenderness which sets us free,
To serve you with our lives.

hosts:
Praise Him for His Word divine.

The gift of your body here on earth,
In which we sing and share."
496;I CANNOT COME TO THE BANQUET;;"A certain man held a feast 
on his fine estate in town, 
He laid a festive table 
and wore a wedding gown;
He sent invitations to his neighbours 
far and wide, 
But when the meal was ready, 
each of them replied, 
I cannot come

CHORUS
I cannot come to the banquet
Don’t trouble me now;
I have married a wife,
I have bought me a cow,
I have fields and commitments
That cost a pretty sum -
Pray, hold me excused,
I cannot come.

The master rose up in anger called 
his servants by name, 
Said, Go into the town, fetch the blind 
and the lame; 
Fetch the peasant and the pauper 
for this I have willed:
My banquet must be crowded 
and my table must filled.

Now, God has written a lesson 
for the rest of mankind, 
If we’re slow in responding 
He may leave us behind;
 He’s preparing a banquet 
for that great and glorious day
 When the Lord and Master calls, 
be certain not to say, I cannot (come.)"
497;I HAVE DECIDED TO FOLLOW JESUS;;"I have decided to follow Jesus,
I have decided to follow Jesus,
I have decided to follow Jesus,
No turning back, no turning back.

Tho’ no one joins me, 
still I will follow, 
Tho’ no one joins me, 
still I will follow, 
Tho’ no one joins me, 
still I will follow 
No turning back, no turning back

The cross before me, 
the world behind me, 
The cross before me, 
the world behind me, 
The cross before me, 
the world behind me, 
No turning back, no turning back"
498;EVERYWHERE HE WENT;;"Everywhere He went 
He was doing good, 
He gave beatitudes, 
fed the multitude- 
Everywhere He could; 
When the crippled saw Him, 
They started walking; 
The dumb were talking as they should 
Everywhere He went, 
my Lord was doing good.

Jesus opened blind eyes,
He heard the faint cry,
He raised the dead and calmed
the sea;
Jesus mighty helper,
He cleansed the lepers,
And set the captive spirit free.
Though the world denied Him,
They crucified Him,
Still He abides with us today,
And His mighty power
Is just the same today.

Well, I've been reading,
And I’ve been feeding
Upon that blessed Word of God -
Marvellous the Story,
So full of glory
It tells the path that Jesus trod;
He was man’s deliverer,
A sin forgiver, and every problem
Understood:
Everywhere He Went,
My Lord Was doing good."
499;IN A WORLD OF FEAR AND TURMOIL;;"In a world of fear and turmoil,
In a race that seems so hard to
run,
Lord, I need Thy rich in-filling 
Even so, Lord Jesus, come.

CHORUS
Even so, Lord Jesus, come
In my heart that I may see
Your light;
Though at times I’ve betrayed
Thy trust -
Even so, Lord Jesus, come.

When my eyes shall spun the river,
When I am gliding through the
world unknown,
May I say with all assurance -
Even so, Lord Jesus, come.

When my hope in Thee is ceasing,
When my heart is dying in
restlessness,
When I am yearning for deliverance
Even so, Lord Jesus, come.

When I am yearning to do Thy will,
When I am willing to proclaim Thy
Name,
And the problems of life come
rolling -
Even so, Lord Jesus, come.

When my soul is full of troubles,
And my eyes grow dim thro’ sorrow
and fear,
Let me call upon Thy Name -
Even so, Lord Jesus, come."
500;ONE DAY I WAS WONDERING;;"One day I was wondering 
what life’s all about, 
Life was full of heartaches, 
restlessness, and doubt; 
Then a gentle stranger whispered 
words of life, 
Pointed me to Heaven, 
wrote my name above.

CHORUS
I know where I’m going 
and whom I’m going to see;
 I have a friend named Jesus 
Waiting there for me, 
He has given me something that only
He could give - 
He gave His life in payment 
so that I could live.

There are many mansions He has
 prepared there, 
That could not be purchased
 by a millionaire;
Streets of gold there glitter, gates of 
pearly white, 
In that day eternal where 
there‘II be no night.

Friends if you are searching 
for a better way, 
I am recommending Jesus, 
trust in Him today; 
He will give life meaning
like no other can:
Come and travel with me 
to that promised land."
501;FACE TO FACE WITH CHRIST;;"Face to face with Christ, my
Saviour,
Face to face - what will it be?
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ, who died for me.

CHORUS
Face to face shall I behold Him, 
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory, 
I shall see Him by and by.

Only faintly now I see Him,
With the darkling veil between,
But a blessed day is coming,
When His glory shall be seen.

What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain;
When the crooked ways are
straightened,

And the dark things shall be plain.
Face to face! O blissful moment!
Face to face - to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ, who loves me so."
502;WHEN JESUS COMES TO REWARD;;"When Jesus comes to reward 
His servants, 
Whether it be noon or night, 
Faithful to Him will He find us 
watching, 
With our lamps all trimmed 
and bright?

CHORUS
Oh, can we say 
we are ready, brother -
Ready for the soul’s bright home?
Say, will He find you and me 
still watching, 
Waiting, waiting, 
when the Lord shall come?

If at the dawn of the early morning,
He shall call us one by one,
When to the Lord we restore our
talents,
Will He answer thee, 
Well done?

Have we been true to the
 trust He left us?
Do we seek to do our best?
If in our hearts there is naught 
condemns us, 
We shall have a glorious rest.

Blessed are those whom the Lord 
finds watching, 
In His glory they shall share; 
If He should come at the dawn 
or mid-night, 
Will He find us watching there?"
503;I KNOW MY NAME IS THERE;;"My name is in the Book of Life,
Oh bless the Name of Jesus
I rise above all doubt and strife
And read my title clear.

CHORUS
I know, I know, I truly know
My name is there
I know, I know, I truly know
My name is written there.

With sinners lost once my
name stood,
Upon a painful record,
But now it's cancelled by the Blood
And written on His roll.

Yet inward trouble often cast
A shadow o’er my title
But now with full salvation blest
Praise God its ever clear.

While others climb through
worldly strife
To carve a Name of Honour
High up in heavens Book of Life
My name is written there."
504;IF YOU COULD OWN THE WORLD;;"If you could own 
all the world and its money
Build castles tall enough to
reach the sky above 
If you could know everything
 there is to know in all the earth
Yet you'd know nothing, 
Until you've known
The love of God

CHORUS
Until you've known the loving hand, 
That reaches down to a fallen man,
And lifts him up from out of sin 
Where he has fallen
Until you've known just how it feels
To know that God Is really real, 
Then you'll know nothing, 
Until you've known 
The Love of God.

If in your life time 
you could meet everybody
If you could call every name 
from here to yonder
But if you've not come face to face 
with Jesus and His saving grace, 
Then you know nothing
until you've known
God and His love"
505;WHERE WILL YOU STAND;;"Chorus
Where will you stand on 
judgment day 
You better make your mind up
right away
You say there’s time you’ll enter in
But how long have you lived in sin
Now tell me, on that day 
where will you stand?

Now the Bible tells that the Word
of God
Is revealed to a prophet,
In Amos 3 verse 7 it’s found
Now the Prophet has all come and gone
And we are waiting for the rapture
When the Lord will take the waiting
Bride away.

There's a tribulation time that’s wrote
In the book of Revelation 
The Bride will be in glory 
before that time
The spirit of God shall be taken away
And the wicked shall remain 
With those that rejected
God’s messenger that came."
506;THEN WE SHALL BE CHANGED;;"We dwell in a house that's
fashioned of clay
Whose foundation is clay
That will soon pass away
But my tent will be changed
Some glorious day for a building
Eternal that will never pass away

CHORUS
Then we shall be changed 
oh glorious day 
Changed In a moment for the 
dead shall be raised 
Changed to be like Him 
This old house of clay, 
the trumpet shall sound 
Then we shall be changed.

This old house of clay is 
too weak and so frail
it makes us to stumble and 
falter and fail
But God’s ever faithful to His 
loved and His own 
Through Jesus He will give us a 
beautiful home."
507;AS A CHILD WE WERE POOR;;"As a child we were poor, 
and tossed in the blues 
I wept bitter tear drops alone in my room, 
The family circle was broken by 
troubles and sin 
But  Jesus held on to my hand.

CHORUS
Jesus held on to my hand
Giving me comfort that only
He can
More than a father, brother or
friend
But Jesus, held on to my hand.

At the old saints revival they 
were making the plea, 
I joined them in singing, 
He is all that I need
He is all that I need
I sat at the altar after three 
weeks to stand
But Jesus held on to my hand."
508;STAND AND BELIEVE;;"CHORUS
You’ve got to stand and believe
For the things you’ve been
praying
Stand and believe
No matter what the world is
saying
You can have what you ask
If you ask Him believing
You will surely receive,
When you stand and believe.

If there is a mountain 
standing in your way, 
You can remove it if you know
 just what to say 
He gave you power, 
you can live above this world 
If you stand upon the word, 
and believe just what He says.

If you need healing for your body 
or your soul
Just call on Jesus He will surely 
make you whole
Don’t trust your feelings,
you got to stand upon the Word 
And speak of all those things 
that are not as though they are."
509;I FORGIVE;;"Like the woman brought to Jesus
who was taken in her sin
I was so ashamed of what I’d done
and where I had been
When justice called the payment
It was more than I could give
Then mercy smiled upon me
Saying, I forgive

The sweetest words He ever said 
was I forgive 
Each sin and stain was wiped away
and I could live
Well I liked the part we are told 
about a mansion He could give 
But the sweetest words He
ever said was, I forgive.

So if you are tired of 
living with the wrong
that you have done, 
Come on home to Jesus you 
know He is plain in words, 
In His hands He will hold you
and you just began to live 
When you hear Him whisper,
I forgive

The sweetest words He ever 
said was I forgive
Each sin and stain was 
wiped away and I could live
Well I liked the part where He told
about a mansion He could give 

But the sweetest words He 
ever said was, I forgive.
Oh I could have been told about 
A mansion He could give, 
But the sweetest words 
He ever said was
I F-O- R-G- I-V -E, I FORGIVE!"
510;I'M GOING THAT WAY;;"A wonderful land of joy and peace, 
wonderful love, 
A beautiful place of mountains 
fair and the sky above, 
I know we'll be near the Saviour 
dear forever shall sing, 
On trusting His Redeeming 
love I’m going that way.

CHORUS
I'm gone that way, 
I’m gone that way
And Jesus the Saviour I 
adore Is with me still
I will sing to Him and never to stray
Oh sing His praises all day long, 
I’m going that way."
511;ON THE JERICHO ROAD;;"As you travel along Jericho road,
Does the world seem all wrong
And heavy your load?
Just bring it to Christ
You sins all confess

CHORUS
On the Jericho road,
Your hear He will bless.
On the Jericho road
There’s room for just two
No more and no less
Just Jesus and you
Each burden He’ll bear
Each sorrow He’ll share
There’s never a care
For Jesus Is there.

On the Jericho road,
Blind Bartimeus sat
His life was void, so empty and flat
But Jesus appeared
One word brought him sight
On the Jericho road
Christ banished his blindness.

Oh brother to you this message 
I bring
Though hope may be gone 
He’ll cause you to sing 
At Jesus command sins 
shackles must fall
On the Jericho road Will you 
answer His call."
512;WHEN JESUS KNOCKED;;"When I was straying out 
in sin 
My Jesus spoke to me
 His voice I certainly heard 
as He said Come unto me
I’ll make you a pure child of God
And get you free from sin 
if you’ll open your heart 
and let me in.

When Jesus knocked at 
my heart’s door I let Him in
He came inside and found my heart
Was stained in sin
He gave me joy and 
peace the world
Could never know, He took 
my heart and washed it white
And spotless as snow, 
I’m happy now and other souls 
I will help to win, Since I opened 
up my heart and let Him in.

When Jesus knocked at 
my heart’s door
I wanted Him to stay, When 
I yielded to Him all my burdens 
rolled away, 
And now I know why Jesus died 
Upon the cross that day, 
When I opened up 
my heart and let Him in."
513;THERE WILL BE SHOUTING ON THE HILLS;;"CHORUS
There will be shouting 
on the hills of glory, 
Shouting on the hills, yes, 
shouting on the hills, 
When we reach that land of which 
we’ve heard the story, 
There will be shouting on the 
hills of God.

What a happy time is coming
 When we reach our home in heaven
And the burdens which we bear 
There we’ll bear no more, 
When the angels 
sound the trumpets
Calling us to those bright 
mansions
There will be shouting on 
the everlasting shore.

When the saints begin to gather
 Round the Throne in that blessed city,
 And the angels there the 
songs of praise uphold 
Harps and golden bells will be ringing
 Saints of all the ages singing 
Such a meeting as we never 
saw before.

On that blessed happy morning, 
When all saints are risen again
 And when all our loved ones we will 
see again, 
In that happy land eternal, 
We will live in joys supernal, 
And with Jesus and the angels ever reign."
514;RIDE OUT YOUR STORM;;"You've been in the storm, 
It seems like forever; 
Your night of confusion has 
been all so long,
Your ship has lost anchor 
and the tide has got you drifting 
If you hold on to Jesus,
He’ll help you ride out your storm.

CHORUS
Ride out your storm,
God's right there with you
You may not see Him
But you’re never alone;
You’re hurting now,
But morning Is coming;
Just hold on to Jesus and 
Ride out your storm.

Remember His promise, 
He said I’ll never forsake you 
Though the waters be raging; 
They will do you no harm, 
Don’t give up your battle; 
Your answer is coming; 
Just hold on to Jesus and 
ride out your storm."
515;I OWE MY WHOLE LIFE TO THE CRUCIFIED ONE;;"Lord where would I be,
If you had not gone,
On that lonely hill to die at Calvary,
What is man, that a King would
leave
His glory above and suffer 
in deep agony.

CHORUS
I owe my whole life 
to the crucified one,
Who gave His all for me, 
With all that’s in me I will praise
His Holy name 
Praise God, for the crucified one.

He walked that lonely hill,
With me in mind,
I was wretched, naked and blind,
My load was so great only One
could bear
Thank God for the crucified word."
516;IT WAS NOT THE NAILS;;"It was not the nails that held 
Our Lord to the cross, 
It was His love for you and me,
The crown of thorns He did not
have to bear
But for love He went to Calvary.

CHORUS
And when that old rugged cross 
Attains the goal, 
And the face of the Saviour
we’ll behold
It will be worth everything 
When we will see the King
And hear Him say, 
my child well done!

On that old rugged cross 
He paid the price for you and me 
Oh such love the world has 
never known
And by His love and by His grace 
We shall look upon His face
And hear Him say, 
""my child well done!"""
517;WHO CAN CHEER THE HEART LIKE JESUS;;"Who can cheer the heart like Jesus
By His presence so divine
Pure, tender and so precious
Oh how blessed to call His name.

CHORUS
Oh what thrills my soul like Jesus
He is more than life to me
He is the fairest of ten thousands
Jesus blessed Lord I know.

Love of Christ so freely given
Grace of God beyond degree
Mercy higher than the heavens
Deeper than the deepest sea.

What a wonderful redemption
Never can a mortal know
How my sins though red as crimson
Could be whiter than the snow.

Every need His hand supplies
Every good in Him I see
Oh His divine hand supplies freely
He is all in all to me.

By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing
And forever and ever
Praise and glorify the King."

Gently lead me all the way;.

would in Thy love abide.

CHORUS

Gently down the stream of time
Lead me, Saviour, all the way.

Thou, the refuge of my soul,...
When life’s stormy billows roll,...
l am safe whenThou art nigh;...
All my hopes on Thee rely.

Saviour, lead me then at last,...
When the storm of life is past,...
To the land of endless day,...
Where all tears are wiped away."
519;TRY A LITTLE KINDNESS;;"If you see your brother 
standing by the road
With a heavy load, 
from the seeds he’s sowed
And if you see your 
sister fallen by the road
Just stop and say you’re
going the wrong way.

CHORUS
You've, got to try a little kindness
Show a little kindness 
Shine your light for everyone to see
And If you try a little kindness 
Than you’ll overlook the blindness
Of the narrow-minded people 
In their narrow-minded streets.

Don’t walk around the down and out
Lend a helping hand instead of doubts
And the little kindness that you 
show every day
Will help someone along the way."
520;GLORY MOUNTAIN;;"We have looked for His 
coming for many years
Miles filled with happiness 
and many filled with tears 
But His promise is sure that 
He will return 
We are looking for the 
day of the Lord.

CHORUS
Glory mountain Is not far away 
Glory mountain, we will see the 
Saviour’s face 
The hope of all ages 
and of every race
Glory mountain,
 we may see today.

High on a mountain, He went away
His disciples were crying, 
and they were afraid 
He gave them assurance 
to comfort all men 
His feet will touch that 
mountain and come again."
521;LIVING ON THE SHORE;;"I've cast my heavy burdens down, 
On canaans happy shore
I'm living where the healing
waters flow
I will wander 
in the wilderness 
of sin and doubt no more, 
I’m living where the healing 
waters flow.

CHORUS
Living on the shore, 
I'm living on the shore, 
I'm living where the healing 
waters flow,
Living on the shore, 
I’m living on the shore, 
I’m living where the healing 
waters flow

With Israel’s trusting children
I’m rejoicing on the way
I’m living where the healing
waters flow,
The cloudy fiery pillar is my
guiding light today
I’m living where the healing
waters flow.

My hung’ring soul is satisfied
 With manna from above, 
I’m living where the healing 
waters flow, 
No more I thirst, the rock
I’ve found
That fount of endless love 
I’m living where the healing 
waters flow.

I’m singing hallelujah, 
Safely anchored in my soul, 
I’m living where the healing 
waters flow, 
I am resting on His promises, 
The blood has made me whole, 
I’m living where the 
healing waters flow."
522;JESUS USE ME;;"Dear Lord I'll be a witness 
if you will help my weakness
I know that I am not 
worthy Lord of Thee
By eyes of faith I see Thee 
Upon the cross of Calvary, 
Dear Lord I pray let me Thy servant be.

CHORUS
Jesus use me, 
Oh Lord and do not refuse me , 
For surely there’s a work 
that I can do, 
And even though I stumble 
Help my will to crumble 
Though the cost be great I'll
work for you.

He is the Lily of the Valley,
The bright and Morning Star
He is the fairest of ten thousands
to my soul
He is the beautiful Rose of Sharon
He is all in all to me
And most of all He is my coming King."

Since the Comforter has come
He abides with us for ever
Makes the trusting heart His home

CHORUS
Blessed quietness, holy quietness
What assurance in my soul 
On the stormy sea Jesus speaks to me
And the billows cease too roll.

Everything is turned to gladness
All around this glorious guest
Banished unbelief and sadness
All is perfect peace and rest.

Like the rain that falls from heaven
Like the sunlight from the sky
So the Holy Ghost He’s given
Falls upon us from on high.

What a wonderful salvation
Where we always see His face
What a peaceful habitation
What a quiet resting place."
524;I'LL FLY AWAY;;"Some glad morning 
when this life is over I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial 
shore, 
I’ll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away (Oh glory), I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah 
by and by I'll fly away.

When the shadows 
of this life are over I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars 
has flown I’ll fly away.

Just a few more weary days 
and then, I’ll fly away 
To a land where joys 
will never end I'll fly away."
525;WHEN MY LIFE ON EARTH IS ENDED;;"When my life on earth is 
ended 
And I cross the rolling tides 
And the beauty of the 
glory land I see
Many saints, friends and loved ones
Will be waiting over there 
But I long to see the one 
who died for me.

CHORUS
Oh Just think about the glory 
Of the land beyond the sky 
Oh just think about the beauty
We shall see by and by 
Many things on earth we value
Will be common over there 
But I long to see the one 
who died for me.

Even though I may have 
suffered
Many things on earth below 
If I have kept the faith
and lived in victory
My reward will there be waiting 
When I enter heavens gates 
And the shining face of Jesus 
I shall see."
526;IT SEEMS TO ME;;"It seems to me this is the day,
When men’s hearts in sins are
swayed,
And their eyes are turning blind
Loving sin with all their might.

CHORUS
But as for me I will serve the
Lord
With all my heart and all my
mind
Keep looking up to God’s own
Word
For my comfort there I find.
Yes my comfort there I find.

How glad I am that I’ve been saved
From sin and shame that kept
me a slave
Now I can soar above the world
For my strength comes from above."
527;LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME;;"This world has fame this world has
fortune
This world has plenty of popularity
How many a man has lived therein
Gone through life and died in sin.

CHORUS
Oh Lord have mercy, 
have mercy on me
I want to stand in 
Thy righteousness
Lord hear my cry I’m trusting 
now In Thee
But for grace It could have 
been me.

Many sad things I have heard
Of children dying in the streets
No one to care for them
But the saddest thing I’ve ever
seen
Is of a man having lived in sin
And dying without God."
528;I’M HOMESICK FOR HEAVEN;;"Somewhere beyond life’s sunset
A home is awaiting for me
Somewhere beyond tomorrow
There’s endless beauty to see
Some day I'll be rewarded
A crown of life I will wear
I have grown so homesick for
heaven
For Jesus is waiting up there.

CHORUS
I am homesick now for heaven,
I’m longing now to go
I'll leave this world for ever
This world of sin here below
Our trials will all be over
We'll shout the victory,
I’ve grown so homesick for
heaven
What a wonderful place that
will be!"
529;FOR SO LONG NOW;;"For so long now we’ve dreamed
about the day
That soon shall come
When He would split the eastern sky
And gather all His jewels home.
I’ve gone too far to turn back now
At last the victory is almost won
I’ve fought the fight I’ve carried the
faith
Thank God I’m almost home.

CHORUS
The angels play the harps so loud
The trumpet rings loud and clear
The day we’ve dreamed of for so long
That day is almost here.

You ask me how I know it’s real
These things I just can’t explain
For all I know is that heavenly tag
I can feel when my heart prays.
It won’t be long and I’ll see old
Jordan
Drifting at my feet
Then I’ll behold the light of home
It’s over my journey is now complete."
530;JOY IN THE MORNING;;"There'll be joy in the morning
When the dead in Christ
Shall rise in that day
I can sing hallelujah going down
I feel like travelling on
There’ll be joy in the morning in
that day.

CHORUS
There’ll be joy in the morning 
There’ll be joy in the morning 
There’ll be joy In the morning 
one of these days 
When we see all our loved ones 
Who have gone on before 
There’ll be joy In the morning
One of these days . . . (what a day)

There are brothers in many dimensions
That are waiting for that day 
When they’ll be appearing to their own
And with great anticipation 
We’re longing for that day
 Oh what a beautiful (wonderful) 
morning Bright and fair."
531;TEACH ME THY WAY;;"If I have failed to comfort 
my brother If he needs help 
and I scorn him away
If I have brought to your heart 
disappointments
Dear Lord forgive the way 
I have lived and teach me 
Thy way.

CHORUS
Teach me to walk in the 
footsteps of Jesus 
Teach me to hear what 
you have to say
Help me bear the cross you 
have given
Hold to my hand, 
help me to stand
And teach me Thy way.

When I must speak to those 
that do not know you 
When I grow tired of the long weary day
When I must wait for an answer 
from heaven
Give me Thy grace, increase my faith
And teach me Thy way.

If I must talk to those 
that do not know you
If I must journey down the long life’s 
road 
If I must bear the burden of others 
Give me Thy grace increase my faith, 
And teach me Thy way."
532;HE IS ALWAYS AT HOME;;"When sorrow comes your way
And your blue skies turn to grey
No matter where you may roam
He'll be your nearest friend
And He'll go with you to the end
You will always find God at home.

CHORUS
He is always at home, 
He's always at home, 
Just knock and you’ll find Him 
at home.
Your neighbours and your Friends
May go away for long weekends
But you’ll always find 
God at home.

When it comes life fleeting breath
And you face the hand of death
No more of this earth you’ll roam
He’ll be your faithful guide
And He’ll stay right by your side
You will always find God at home."
533;TELL YOUR CHILDREN OF HIS SECOND COMING;;"Hear ye the trumpet in Zion 
Our Lord is coming back 
to earth again
In the Holy mountain sound
 the warning
Call all those who wear the
 yoke of sin.

CHORUS
Tell your children and your 
children’s children 
Of the second coming of
 our King
He will stand upon the
 Mount of Olives
Salvation to the dying world 
to bring.

Joel prophesied of his wisdom
If we fail to walk in righteousness
It will be too late to ask for mercy
And the dawning of the day will
end."
534;HE IS WORKING ON ME;;"CHORUS
He is still working on me
To make me what I ought to be
It took Him just a week 
To make the moon and the stars
The sun and the earth
And Jupiter and Mars
How loving and patient He
must be
He is still working on me.

There really ought to be,
A sign upon my heart
Don’t judge me  yet,
There’s an unfinished part
That I will be perfect
Just according to His plan
Fashioned by the Master’s loving
hands.

In the mirror of His Word
Reflections that I see
Makes me wonder why
He never gave up on me
He loves me as I am
And helps me when I pray
Remember He is the potter
I am the clay."
535;MY LORD KEEPS A RECORD OF MY MOMENTS;;"What a wonderful beautiful 
picture I have
Of a place without sorrow or fear 
And I am going to live in a city 
somewhere
Cause my days are all numbered 
down here.

CHORUS
My Lord keeps a record of 
the moment.
I am living down here
He knows all about me 
All my troubles, my sorrows my fears 
I am living every moment 
Through the mercies of 
God’s loving grace
Some day He will call me
To that wonderful beautiful place.

I want to be doing the will of my Lord
As I travel this wearisome land 
So I’ll not be ashamed
of my record up there, 
As I stand at my Saviour’s right hand."
536;WHEN GOD FIXED HIS LOVE IN MY HEART;;"When God types His pen 
of love in my heart
And writes my soul a message 
He wants me to know
His spirit of discernment heals 
this sinful soul of mine 
Hallelujah when God fixed 
His love in my heart.

CHORUS
When a sinner gets changed 
to a living soul
By God’s salvation that made me whole
So I found I couldn’t find such love as
Jesus did impart 
Such love makes me 
laugh and makes me cry
Sets my sinful soul on fire Hallelujah, 
when God fixed 
His love In my heart.

He walked every step up 
Calvary’s ragged way
He gave His life completely 
and brought a better day 
My life was deep in sin but 
in love took me in
Hallelujah, His blood washed 
every stain."
537;MY GOD DELIVERS AGAIN;;"Standing there at the Red sea
God's people begun to complain
Saying Pharaoh and his 
mighty army
Will take us to bondage again
Stand still and see the salvation
Of the Lord Moses cried
Then God came parted the waters
And they crossed to the other side.

CHORUS
God delivers again
Oh my God delivers again
When it seems that all is lost
He reaches down His hand
Then all the forces of evil have
to flee
At His command
Just when things look hopeless
My God delivers again.

We’ll never bow to your idols
The Hebrew children proclaimed
So the King gave the command
To throw them into the flame
Then he said did we not cast 
 three men
Into the furnace fire
I see four men now loose in
 the fire
Unhurt and are walking around."
538;I DON'T WANT TO MISS IT, DO YOU?;;"Some day my work 
will be over
And my labour for 
Him will be through
Then I'll climb yonder 
hill top to meet Him
For I don't want to miss it,
do you?

CHORUS
No I wouldn't miss
 it for nothing
No matter what I 
have to go through
Some day I'll lay down
life’s burden
For I don’t want to miss
it, do you?


Sometimes I’m tired 
of my journey 
and I can’t seem to
find Him that’s true
But I know that He’s
waiting up yonder
And I don’t want to miss it 
do you?"
539;WHO DO YOU SAY I AM;;"Whenever God's moving 
or reveals anything
Many people just ridicule 
and scoff at the thing 
But there's always some 
faithful the true seed of God 
That will cling to God’s promise 
and walk on in love.

CHORUS
Some called Him a devil 
Some called Him God 
some called Him a fortune teller or 
Beelzebub 
Some called it psychology 
But in God we can trust 
To fulfil all the scriptures 
That are promised for us.

In the days of Jesus the son of God 
When He asked them 
who people said that He was, 
Some say you are Elias, 
Jeremiah or John
But then He asked his disciples 
Who do you say I am?

We are promised in the end time 
that Elias must come
To reveal the mysteries before Jesus 
can come 
Some will call him a devil
While some think he is god 
But there’s some that’s rejoicing 
for the True Word of God."
540;THERE IS PEACE IN THAT LAND;;"When my soul was disturbed 
with sorrows
And my heart was burdened 
with pain
Jesus opened His arms of mercy 
And He tenderly took me in.

CHORUS
There is peace in the 
time of troubles
There is peace in the 
midst of all storms
There is peace though
 the world be raging 
In the shelter of His own arms.

There are storms that we 
often encounter
Do not fear they will do
 you no harm
In the storms you will find 
protection
In the shelter of His arms."
541;I AM NEARER HOME THAN I WAS YESTERDAY;;"I walk with God through long years
Through plains and floods
Through pain and fear
I follow Him His voice obeying
I am nearer home than I was
yesterday.

CHORUS
I am nearer home than I was
yesterday
I am closer to God along the
way
Each day by day each prayer
I pray
I am nearer home than I was
yesterday.

The bleeding clouds that 
sweeps the sky
The whispering wind that 
chills the ships
The night the crisping sun 
all speak and say
I am nearer home than 
I was yesterday"
542;HIGHER HANDS ARE LEADING ME;;"Though it seems I am oft unnoticed
And lost in time and space
God above is watching over me
Though I cannot see His face.

CHORUS
Higher hands are leading me,
are leading me
Higher hands are leading me,
I am not alone I know
As I walk in this world below
For higher hands are leading me.

There’s a great eternal purpose
In the life of everyone
And some day we'll know its
meaning
When our life on earth is done.

So I face an unknown future
Full of faith and unafraid
And the faith I have through trusting
For the world I would not trade."
543;I'D RATHER HAVE JESUS;;"I'd rather have Jesus 
than silver or gold
I’d rather be His 
than have riches untold
I’d rather have Jesus
 than houses or lands
I’d rather be led 
by His nails pierced hands.

CHORUS
Than to be a king of a vast
domain
Or be held by sins great sway 
I’d rather have Jesus 
than anything
This world affords today.

I’d rather have Jesus 
than men’s applause
I’d rather be faithful 
to His dear cause
I’d rather have Jesus 
than world wide fame
I’d rather be true 
to His holy name.

He’s fairer than the Lilies
 of rarest bloom
He’s sweeter than the honey 
out of the comb
He’s all that my hungering 
spirit needs
I’d rather have Jesus 
and let Him lead.."
544;THERE IS SOMEONE WHO CARES;;"When the world seems so cold
And your friends seem far
There is someone who cares for you
When tears are in your eyes
Your heart bleeds inside
There is someone who cares for you.

CHORUS
Someone who cares, someone to share
All your troubles like no other can do
He will come down from the skies
And brush the tears from your eyes
You are His child and He cares for you.

When your disappointments come
 And you feel so blue 
There is someone who cares for you
 When you need a friend a friend 
till the end
There is someone who is a friend to you."
545;THE LORD’S OUR ROCK IN HIM WE HIDE;;"The Lord's our Rock in 
Him we hide,
A shelter in the time of storm,
Secure whatever ill betide
A shelter in the time of storm.

CHORUS
Oh, Jesus Is a Rock 
in a weary land
A weary land, a weary land, 
Oh, Jesus is a Rock 
in a weary land
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shade by day, defence by night,
A shelter in the time of storm,
No fears alarm, no foes affright
A shelter in the time of storm.

The raging storms may round us beat
A shelter in the time of storm
We’ll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.

Oh, Rock divine, Oh refuge dear
A shelter in the time of storm
Be Thou our helper, ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm."
546;WE'LL HAVE JOY OVER THERE;;"There is a longing here below
Only God’s people can know
We'll be changed in a moment
In the rapture far away
We’re looking for a city
That Abraham did in His day
I am longing for the bright and
perfect day.

CHORUS
We'll have joy over there 
In that city bright and fair 
When we gather around and sing
Amazing grace, 
We’ll shout and dance about 
And we’ll sing Amazing love
Oh yes we’ll sing Amazing grace 
over there, Over there.

He’ll call my name up there
Before I climb those golden stairs
We have loved ones there awaiting
We’ll meet at the Eastern gate
Oh my brother lets press on
Till this battle has been won
I can hardly wait to see,
My Saviour’s face."
547;I'LL LEAVE WITHOUT SAYING GOOD BYE;;"If Jesus should come x 2
I will welcome the call from on high
There is nothing to hold me
No money nor home,
I’ll leave without saying good-bye.

CHORUS
I'm longing (to go x 2) 
If the trumpet Lord should sound 
From the mansions on high 
I'll leave without saying good-bye.

My garments are spotless
I’ve washed my robes white
For the blood is flowing over my soul
The way is so clear
Though it's dark as the night
For a saint keeps his eyes on the goal."
548;A LONGING IN MY HEART;;"When I think of all the blessings
Christ has given
How He saved my soul and washed 
my sins away 
I have a longing in my heart 
to be with Jesus
And I know His coming can’t be too far away.

CHORUS
I have a longing In my heart 
to see the Lord
I've a longing In my heart 
for His return
Too much troubles here to bear, 
Too much worry, too much fear
I’ve a longing in my heart 
to see the Lord.

Many times my burdens seem 
so hard to carry 
Many times I have to smile 
to hide my tears, 
But in heaven there will be 
no cross to carry 
There will be no sorrow through
 the countless years."
549;IF WE NEVER MEET AGAIN;;"Chorus
Soon we'll come to the end 
of life's journey
And perhaps, we'll never meet 
any more, 
Till we gather in heaven’s 
bright city 
Far away on that beautiful shore.

Where the charming roses bloom, 
forever,
And where separations 
come no more, 
If we never meet again this 
side of heaven 
I’ll meet you on that beautiful shore.

Oh they say we’ll meet by the river, 
Where no stormy clouds 
ever darken the sky
And they say we'll be happy in heaven, 
In that wonderful sweet by and by."
550;TO THAT SUMMER LAND;;"To that summer land up yonder,
Where the angels ever sing
Hallelujahs to the Saviour,
Sweet hosannas to the King;
We are marching swiftly onward,
Guided by our Father’s hand
Thro’ this world of sin and sorrow,
To that happy summer land.

CHORUS
Oh,. . . the joy when we
get there...
Golden crowns of life to wear...
In that happy land so fair
In that summer land up yonder.

To that summer land up yonder
Some are going every day,
And the time is drawing nearer
When we, too, shall go away;
We are going straight to Jesus,
There to join the ransom’d band,
We will praise His Name for ever,
In that happy summer land.

In that summer land up yonder
There’s a place prepared for all
Who are trusting in the Saviour,
Who will listen to His call;
and the happy time is coming
When the Lord shall give command,
And we’ll leave this world for ever
For that happy summer land."
551;WHEREVER YOU MAY BE THANK GOD;;"CHORUS
Thank God for all the flowers 
and each tree 
Thank God for all the mountains
 and the seas 
Thank God for giving life to you 
and me 
Wherever you may be, thank God.

Be forgiving to the wayward
Like the Master told us to
When He said forgive them Father
For they know not what they do
They’d change their ways of living
If they could but understand
So remember they’re your brothers
They need a helping hand.

Now the road is straight and narrow
That the saints have travelled on
It’s with all the tribulations
Of the martyrs that have gone
If we pray to God for the victory
And for showing us the way
Then give thanks for all the blessings
Get down on your knees and pray."
552;ARE YOU WEARY?;;"Are you weary, are you heavy 
hearted?
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus.
Are you grieving over joys departed?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

CHORUS
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
He is a Friend that’s well known;
You have no other such a friend
or brother
Tell it to Jesus alone.

Do the tears flow down your 
cheeks unbidden
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus. 
Have you sins that to man’s 
eyes are hidden?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

Do you fear the gath’ring 
clouds of sorrow?
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus. 
Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

Are you troubled with 
the thought of dying?
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus. 
For Christ’s coming
 kingdom are you sighing?
Tell it to Jesus alone."
553;WHEN I'VE SAID GOODBYE;;"When I've left and said goodbye
Oh don't you worry,
For I'm just going home
Yes my Saviours outstretched arms
Are waiting for me Oh yes
Don’t you worry I’m just going home.

CHORUS
I'll be up there in that mansion 
I shall walk on streets of pure gold
And when I’ve left and said goodbye 
For that city in the sky 
Oh don’t you worry 
I’m just going home.

It is not for just a day but forever 
My Saviour’s presence
I shall behold Yes and 
when at last there’s peace eternal Oh yes
Don’t you worry I’m just going home.
And when I’ve left and said goodbye 
For that city in the sky
O don’t you worry, I’m just going home."
554;I KNOW I'M SAVED;;"I once was sad and lonely, 
I felt so all alone
Until I asked the Lord to take control 
He gave me an answer, 
and said that I was set free
 He cleansed my heart 
and really blessed by soul.

CHORUS
I know I'm saved
I know I’m saved 
I'm filled with the Holy Spirit 
deep inside
I know I’m saved
I know I’m saved
I’ll always Keep my Saviour
by my side.

I want to live for Jesus 
and tell of His great love
And thank Him for my blessings 
every day
He gave me sweet contentment 
and filled my heart with joy
And now in His loving kindness
I shall stay."
555;I AM DWELLING IN BEULAH LAND;;"Far away the noise of strife 
upon my ear is falling, 
Then I know the sins of earth 
beset on every hand 
Doubt and fear and things 
of earth in vain to me are calling 
None of these shall move 
me from Beulah land.

CHORUS
I'm living, on the mountain, 
underneath a cloudless sky 
I’m drinking at the fountain 
that never shall run dry 
Oh yes I’m feasting, on the manna 
from a bountiful supply 
For I am dwelling in Beulah land.

Far below the storm of doubt 
upon the world’s beating 
Sons of men in battle long 
the enemy withstand 
Safe am I within the castle 
of God’s Word retreating.
Nothing then can reach 
me in Beulah land.

Let the stormy breezes blow, 
their cry cannot alarm me
I am safely sheltered here 
protected by God’s hand 
Here the sun always shining, 
here there’s naught can harm me.
I am safe forever in Beulah land.

Viewing here the works of God,
I sink in contemplation
Hearing now his blessed voice,
I see the way He planned
Dwelling in the spirit here,
I learn of full salvation
Gladly will I tarry in Beulah land."
556;I'M GOING HOME AT SUN DOWN;;"As I wondered today 
neath the setting sun
I dreamed of days long ago 
And it seemed I was travelling
 home once more 
With loved ones I used to know.

CHORUS
At sundown I’m going home 
At sundown no more to roam 
Sweet voices are calling, 
calling me
And I’m going home at sundown.
Spoken words
The time has come now 
For the sun of my life is sinking 
low 
My steps are not as fast as 
before 
But I know my loved ones are waiting 
To welcome me home once more.

Just like a child I used
to go home
When the day was done,
How I’m longing for the last time
Because it is sundown."
557;ROHO YANGU HIMA;;"Roho yangu hima, na taa yako
Kaiwashe vyema, hapa si pako;
Nguvu zote pia za duniani
Hazitakudhuru ukiamini;

Yesu yuko mbele,
Yesu yu nyuma, 
Yesu vivyo kando, 
walindwa vyema.

Adui shetani, na nguvu zake,
Bwana ameshinda kwa kifo chake;
Wewe nguvu huna, huna kabisa,
Ndiwe mpungufu, mnyonge hasa.

Toka na mapema, mbele ya wote,
Omba, bisha sana, maisha yote;
Vita vikaliko, macho ukae,
jivike silaha, nawe sishindwe.

Bwana Yesu ndiye kwako Mchunga,
Neno lake Bwana ndilo upanga;
Mbingu zitakwisha, na nchi pia,
Neno lake Bwana laendelea."
558;IS YOUR ALL ON THE ALTAR LAID?;;"You have longed for sweet peace,
And for faith to increase,
And have earnestly, fervently prayed
But you cannot have rest, or be
perfectly blessed
Till your all on the altar is laid.

CHORUS
Is your heart on the altar of sacrifice laid? 
Your heart does the Spirit control?
 You can only be blessed 
And have peace and sweet rest,
 As you yield Him your body and soul.

Would you walk with the Lord,
In the light of His word,
And have peace and
contentment always
You must do His sweet will
To be free from all ill
When your all on the altar is laid.

Oh we never can know,
What the Lord can bestow,
Of the blessings of which
we have prayed
Till our body and soul
He doth fully control
And our all on the altar is laid.

Who can tell of the love,
He will send from above,
And how happy our hearts
will be made
Of the fellowship sweet,
We shall share at His feet,
When our all on the altar is laid."
559;JUST KEEP ON BELIEVING;;"Jesus is leading us on day by day, 
He walks besides us always, 
Giving us the victory
as we overcome 
And He will be there 
when we lay our burdens down.

CHORUS
Just keep on remembering
That God Is always near;
Just keep on believing
That His love will cast out fear,
The sun waits to break through,
And the clouds will roll away,
If you have faith that
there will be
A better brighter day

Just keep His word before you
As you walk this narrow way,
Don’t let Satan get you
down today,
Stay by your post of duty,
The race is almost run,
Time is late now,
It’s the setting of the sun."
560;HOW CAN TWO WALK TOGETHER;;"It all started in the garden
 of Eden,
When the first two were born 
in sin
Now Cain was the seed 
of the serpent
And Abel was the true seed 
of God.

CHORUS
How can two walk together,
Unless they both agree,
One believes In trinity doctrine
And the other believes
In one God.

Now Cain looked for fame
and beauty,
While Abel sought the face 
of God,
Now they tried to walk together
But they found they could not agree.

Those two spirits that
started in Eden,
Still rule over man’s heart today
One spirit will give you
worldly wisdom
And the other the true
Word of God."
561;I AM LEARNING TO LEAN;F;"CHORUS
Learning to lean,
learning to lean
I'm Learning to lean on Jesus
Gaining more power than
I ever dreamed
I'm learning to lean
on Jesus.

The joy I can’t explain
 it fills my soul 
Since I found Jesus my King, 
His blessed Holy Spirit is leading 
my way 
And He is teaching me 
Oh am I am learning to lean.

There’s glorious victory 
each day now for me
I found His peace so serene, 
He helps me with each task
If only I will ask
Every day now I am learning to lean.
Thank God Oh...


Sad, broken hearted,
At an altar I knelt.
I found peace that is so serene.
And all that He asks
Is a child like trust
And a heart that is
Learning to lean."
562;GO FEED MY SHEEP;;"Go search them today,
On the mountains over hills
My sheep gone astray,
So far from their fold
Go find them and bring them
And ask me not why
And I will reward  when I come.

CHORUS
Go feed all my sheep, 
my little lambs too, (x3)
And I will reward you 
when I come.

Upon thine own shoulders,
Go bring them today,
And fervently lead those,
Who have all  gone astray,
Go find them and bring them,
And ask me not why
And I will reward  when I come."
563;IS THERE ANYTHING TOO HARD;;"One day I was thinking of Jesus 
my Lord, 
And salvation so full and so free, 
The cares of this life were 
heavy to bear, 
Then He whispered so sweetly to me.

CHORUS
Is there anything too hard to bear,
Sure there’s something that I
can always do, 
All power in heaven is given to me, 
Believe me and I will 
see you through.

Is your heart burdened
with problems and cares
Does your life seem wasted away?
Come to Jesus the Saviour,
Repent of all your sins,
Just believe and to you He will say."
564;NDIYE APITAYE WOTE;;"Ndiye apitaye wote, Bwana Yesu;
Atupenda sisi sote, Bwana Yesu;
Ndugu zetu huondoka, jamaa
watapunguka,
Lakini hatatwepuka Bwana Yesu.

Ndiye halisi rafiki, Bwana Yesu;
Atutetea kwa haki, Bwana Yesu;
Yeye ndiye nguvu zetu, Na
upatanishi wetu;
Maji ya uzima kwetu, Bwana Yesu.

Ametutendea vyema, Bwana Yesu;
Ametulinda sawa, Bwana Yesu;
Alitutafuta tena, tulipopotea sana,
Hata tukapatikana, Bwana Yesu.

Msamaha tele kwake, Bwana Yesu;
Wokovu kwa kifo chake, BwanaYesu;
Atwongoza tuli chini, safari ya
duniani,
Kutupeleka mbinguni, Bwana Yesu."
565;JESUS KEEP ME FROM ALL WRONG;;"I had lived a life of sin and sorrow,
Till I found the Lord,
Jesus is my Saviour He died
at Calvary;
I’ll follow Him with all my heart,
I love Him, yes I do
I can see a new bright future
As from sin He set me free.

CHORUS
Jesus keep me from all wrong,
Jesus He was God’s
begotten Son
Jesus the sweetest name
I know,
Jesus, He guides me as I go.

One day we’ll hear Him calling,
We’ll meet Him in the air;
We shall all rise up to heaven
For the marriage supper there
For there there’s peace forever
Upon that golden shore,
We’ll reign with Christ in Heaven
And praise Him ever more."
566;ELIJAH'S GOD STILL LIVES TODAY;;"There was a man in olden days,
Elijah was His name,
Because the sin did so abound
He prayed and stopped the rain,
And for three years or
more were told,
They never had a shower,
For God in heaven answered then,
Elijah’s prayer of power.

CHORUS
Elijah's God still lives today
Oh blessed be His name
And when His children to
Him pray
He answers still the same,
Yes He controls the universe
All things obey His word,
And when by faith we call
on Him,
Our humble prayer He hears.

He gathered all the
priests of Baal, 
To call upon their god, 
They cried to him the whole 
day long, 
He answered not a word, 
But when Elijah called on God, 
Before the people there, 
The Lord sent fire from heaven above, 
Because He heard his prayer.

Then to the top of Carmels mount,
The holy prophet went
And prayed unto the Lord again,
That rain once more be seen,
He poured his heart unto his God,
Nor was his prayer in vain,
The clouds in heaven again
were seen,
God sent a mighty rain."
567;HIS GOOD IN ME;;"I have spent all the money 
I ever owned
I have squandered all my talents, 
there’s nothing to show
But now I gladly come 
just as I am to Jesus
And I pray He’d create His 
good in me.

CHORUS
But maybe He can make 
something  of me Oooh... 
I know I’m not as smart
Like someone else, 
I don’t pretend to be
But this one thing I know for sure
My old wretched  soul won’t find its cure 
Till He has been lifted in me.

This old flesh I wear 
gets so hard to bear
And is sometimes weak 
My forgetful mind just won’t let me find
The words to speak
And everyday old Satan tells me
That there’s no need to believe 
That He could ever make 
something of me.

But this one thing l know for sure
My old wretched soul has found
its cure
For He has made His good
in me."
568;TELL THE ANGELS I'M ON MY WAY;;"Oh Lord hear my cry,
For some day I know I’ll die
Tell the angels I’m on my way,
I am so weary here below,
Bound beneath this heavy load,
Tell the angels I’m on my way

CHORUS
Oh tell the angels I’m on my way,
For I’m coming home to stay,
Tell the angels, I’m on my way,
On heaven’s peaceful shore,
Where we’ll never part no more,
Tell the angels I’m on my way.

Thank you Lord you heard my plea,
Saved my soul and rescued me,
Tell the angels I’m on my way,
There’s a greater place I know,
It’s a place I long to go,
Tell the angels I’m on my way."
569;NOW I HAVE EVERYTHING;;"I had nothing but heartaches
and troubles
I was seeking for fortune and fame
I had nothing but doubts
and confusion
But now I have everything.

chorus
Everything I need to make me happy, 
I have Jesus to show me the way, 
He has saved me and given me life eternal, 
And now I have everything.

I was making big plans for my future, 
I was living my life time in vain, 
Then I prayed for life’s only meaning, 
And now I have everything."
570;LET THE LORD HAVE HIS WAY;;"CHORUS
Let the Lord have His way, 
Let the Lord have His way, 
Put your hand In His hand 
and let Him lead, 
Look up high and see a crown 
awaiting over there, 
And let the Lord, 
Oh let the Lord have His way.

When the road seems so rough
And the valleys so low,
And the mountains so high
you cannot climb
Cast your care upon the Lord
He will clear the way for you
So let the Lord, so let the Lord
Have His way.

When I think of men of old, 
I think of Noah a man of God 
When he was told to build an ark by the Lord 
This he did without complaint 
And so was saved from the flood, 
Because he let, 
he let the Lord have His way."
571;HAVE YOU HEARD THE SHOUT;;"Have you heard the shout, 
as it went out loud and clear,
Come out come out my friends, 
Don’t partake of their creeds 
The mysteries have been revealed, 
It’s evening time, 
keep your lamps trimmed and clear.


chorus
How many times must a 
man hear God’s call 
Before he’ll turn away from sins, 
How many times can you reject 
God’s word
Before He shuts the
door on you?
My friend  do you realise 
God’s spirit won’t always strive
God’s spirit won’t always 
strive with man.


Through the mouth of the prophet, 
God has spoken once again, 
Repent repent of all of your sins 
Be baptized in Jesus Name 
For His power is still the same 
Just believe the promise 
given to you."
572;WE GOT ALL POWER;;"Give me your hand 
let’s agree together
Then all of our enemies 
shall crumble at our feet
For whatever we bind on earth, 
shall be bound in heaven
In the name of Jesus, 
satan has to flee.

CHORUS
Coz, we've got the power
 in the Name of Jesus
We've got the power 
In the Name of the Lord
Though satan rages 
we cannot be defeated
We've got all power 
In the Name of
the Lord.

For many years now satan has
tried to stop us
But the Bride of Jesus
Lo! is still alive
Like a mighty army
We keep marching onward 
Winning every battle
for the Lord’s on our side."
573;KEEP HOLDING ON;;"Keep holding on,
No matter what comes your way
Soon the journey will be over,
Have faith in God,
He will never let you down,
Just keep on holding
To those nail scarred hands.

CHORUS
They are strong and sure and 
you will never fear 
He’ll hold you secure so let it 
keep you in cheer, 
Have faith in God, 
He’ll never let you down,
Just keep on holding to
those nail scarred hands.

Keep holding on,
No matter what comes your way
Soon the journey will be over;
Knowing some day
You will be so very glad,
For you kept on holding
To those nail scarred hands."
574;PICK UP THE BROKEN PIECES;;"CHORUS
Pick up the broken pieces
And bring them to the Lord
Pick up the broken pieces
Trust in His Holy Word
He will put them back together;
And make your life complete
Just place the broken pieces 
At the Saviour’s feet.

Have you failed in life’s battle
To accomplish your plans,
Is your heart heavy laden
Do you fear the Lord’s command?
Do you feel that no ones loves you
And there’s no use to try
Take up your case to Jesus
Your soul He’ll satisfy.

Do you feel that there is no hope
Broken hearts cannot mend,
Christ can take the broken pieces
And make you whole again
Storms of doubt blow from
all directions
But don’t you be afraid
God can make all correction
He made your body out of clay."
575;HALLELUJAH ANYHOW;;"Chorus
Hallelujah, anyhow I'll never 
let my troubles get me down,
 Whatever problems life may bring 
I’ll hold my head up high and sing;
Hallelujah, anyhow.

When you're in a valley dark and low 
Your friends so true and 
real where do they go, 
But if want to see your troubles 
fly, Just sing this song and
 hold your hands up high.

Once I read about a man named Job
Trials and afflictions laid him low,
His wife told him why don’t you curse
God and die,
But instead he sang this song
and held his head up high."
576;I KNOW THE ANSWER MAN;;"I don't know all the answers,
But I know the Answer Man,
I can’t solve all my problems,
But I know the one who can.
I have a direct wire right to the
Lord above,
He has promised to answer
every prayer,
Oh, He’s the Man with
the answers,
I’m glad I know the Answer Man.

I don't fret stray or worry,
For my life is in His hands
Troubles run in a hurry
They all flee at His command,
Put your trust in Him
He’ll lead you constantly.
For He loves you the same as
He loves me
And then you tell everybody,
I’m glad I know the Answer Man.

Yesterday and tomorrow
Only meet with us today
And today we can’t borrow
What the two can never pay
The Answer Man alone
Knows all our future plans
I am so happy my life
is in His hands
So today, I’ve no sorrows,
Because I know the Answer Man."
577;NOTHING TO HINDER ME;;"One day I heard a voice
Saying make the Lord your choice
I'll take away your every sin
And set you free,
So I came to Him that day
And He took my sins away
Now I don’t want nothing here
to hinder me.

CHORUS
I don't want nothing here to hinder me 
For some day His blessed face 
I want to see, 
It makes no difference what the cost
Or how heavy my cross 
I don’t want nothing here to hinder me.

Many times I’m tossed about, 
Many times I do without 
And many times my heart is burdened down 
with care 
But I know if I stay true
Then some day He’ll see me through
If I don’t let nothing
here hinder me."
578;AT CALVARY;;"Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died,
At Calvary.

CHORUS
Mercy there was great, 
and grace was free, 
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul
found liberty at Calvary.

By God’s Word at last my sin I learned; 
Then I trembled at the Law I spurned, 
Till my guilty soul imploring 
turned to Calvary.

Now I give to Jesus everything, 
Now I gladly own Him as my King, 
Now my raptured soul can 
only sing of Calvary.

Oh, the love that drew salvation’s Plan;
Oh, the Grace that brought
it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that God 
did span, at Calvary."
579;HE HIDETH MY SOUL;;"A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
A wonderful Saviour to me; 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the Rock
 Where rivers of pleasure I see.

CHORUS
He hideth my soul 
in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry thirsty land, 
He hideth my life
 in the depths of His love 
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.

A wonderful Saviour is
Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away,
He holdeth me up
And I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

With numberless blessings
Each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture
“Oh glory to God:
For such a Redeemer as mine!

When clothed in His brightness,
Transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation,
His wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high."
580;WE SHALL SEE THE KING;;"There's a blessed time 
that’s coming soon, 
It may be evening, morning or at noon;
The wedding of the Bride 
united with the Groom, 
We shall see the King when He Comes.

CHORUS
We shall see the King, 
We shall see the King, 
We shall see the King when He comes 
He's coming in power, 
Oh hail that blessed hour 
We shall see the King when He comes.

Are you ready should the Saviour call today, 
Would Jesus say well done or go away, 
My home is for the pure, 
the vile can never stay 
We shall see the King when He comes.

Oh my brother are you ready for the call, 
To crown your Saviour 
King and Lord of all, 
The kingdoms of this world 
shall soon before Him 
fall 
We shall see the King when He comes."
581;NO TEARS IN HEAVEN;;"No tears in heaven, 
no sorrows even, 
All will be glory in that land, 
There’ll be no sadness, 
all will be gladness, 
When we’ll join our heavenly band.

CHORUS
No tears in heaven, no tears
In heaven,
Sorrows and pain will all
have gone,
No tears in heaven, no tears
In heaven,
No tears in heaven will be known.

Glory is waiting, waiting up yonder,
Soon we will enter eternal gates
There with our Saviour we'll
be forever
Where no sorrows can dismay.

Some morning yonder, 
we’ll cease to ponder, 
Over all this life has brought to view, 
All will be nearer, 
loved ones be dearer, 
In heaven where all will be made new."
582;SATURDAY EVENING;;"It is Saturday evening the sun 
is almost gone,
And we are looking for the 
coming of the Lord, 
The week is past and gone the 
day is almost spent,
And it’s Saturday evening of time.

CHORUS
The Bible is almost fulfilled, 
His coming is at the door, 
We are living in the days He spoke about,
When the sun shall be darkened 
and the moon won’t give It a light
And it's Saturday evening of time.

No more will our friends 
have to leave us,
And fight the wars across the sea 
The stars will shine there forever 
By the one who shed His 
blood at Calvary.

There will be peace on that day 
so they tell me
For the former things of earth will 
pass away 
There will be no more sorrows
neither crying 
For God Himself shall wipe
away our tears.

They say the walls are made of Jasper
And they say the streets are pure 
gold 
And they tell me we'll have a 
lovely mansion 
And we’ll meet our loved ones 
those that are gone."
583;OVER THE NEXT HILL WE'LL BE HOME;;"By the way the land is laying
I think I’d be certain saying
That over the next hill we'll be home
It’s a straight and narrow highway
No detours and no by-ways
And over the next hill we’ll be home.

CHORUS
When we get there we are hoping 
That we’ll find the gate is open
And there’ll be a refuge from the 
coming storm 
For the way's been long 
and weary
But at last the end is nearing. 
And over the next hill we’ll be home.

By the speed that we’re making
I would say there’s no mistaking
That over the next hill we’ll be home,
There’s a place that we’re nearing
That so many have been fearing
But over the next hill we’ll be home."
584;BEHOLD WHAT MANNER OF MAN IS THIS;;"Behold what manner of man is this,
Who stands between God and man
His eyes are a flame of fire
His fan is in His hand
John saw Him in the seven churches
As the sun of brilliancy
Behold what manner of man is this
what manner of man is this.

CHORUS
He Is the Lord of glory,
The Great I am,
The Alpha and Omega
The Beginning and the End
His name is wonderful
The Prince of Peace is He
The Everlasting Father,
Throughout eternity.

Behold what manner of man is this
Who sits upon heavenly Throne
He rules and reigns from
Heaven above
His loved ones and His own
He is the lion of the tribe of Judah
The root of David is He
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is this.

Behold what manner of man is this
Who speaks with a woman at
the well
Everlasting life I’ll give to thee
And richer than man can tell
Whosoever will drink of this well
Shall live eternally
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is this."

Lord don't let me fail you
I wonna be in your bride
When my way grows dark
Keep me by your side
When my faith grows weak
Always let me see
Something in my life Lord
You have done for me.

We follow on our way
We are all like sheep Lord
Who’ve gone astray
Christ is our Saviour
He’ll never forsake His own
In this age of sin
I know He’s gonna lead me home.

Sometimes the way is weary
I am burdened down with tears
It seems I have no friends to keep
me here
Then I hear your voice
Saying come I am your God
I will take you through."
587;KILIMA KANDO YA MJI;;"Kilima kando ya mji

Mateso dhaifu:
Alikufa Mwenye haki

Aiimwaga damu yake
Ili tuwe wema,
Tufae kukaa kwake
Mbinguni daima.

Hatuna mwenye imani
Aliye na haki,
Wa kutosha yetu deni
Rafiki Yesu tu.

Alijua peke yake
Kufungua mbingu
Ufunguo damu yake
Kondoo wa Mungu.

Tukamtumai vivyo
Na kazi tutende."

Everything I did was on my own
I thought the world was mine
And everything was fine
But I saw my roses wilt
and fade away.

CHORUS
Then I found the Lily 
of the Valley
In the shadow of the cross 
I saw Him bloom 
He took away my fears 
And wiped away my tears 
For the Lily of the Valley is my Lord.

I saw the Lily of the Valley
From a world of sin I tried to flee
Oh everything went wrong
It seemed that hope was gone
Then the Lily of the Valley
rescued me."

When Jesus steps out 
On a cloud to call out God’s children
The dead in Christ shall rise to meet Him
 in the air 
And then those that remain,
 will be quickly changed
At the midnight cry
 When Jesus comes again.

I look around, 
I see prophecies fulfilled
And the signs of the 
times are everywhere
I can almost hear my Father as He says
Son go get my children 
And at the midnight cry (thank God) 
This bride of Christ is gonna rise.

When Jesus steps up 
On the cloud before God’s children
The dead In Christ shall rise
To meet Him in the air
And then those that remain,

I'm walking in the light of the 
Word of God,
No longer in darkness,

He guards me each step of the way.

When I walk through the dark 
lonesome valley, 
My Saviour will walk with me there 
And safely His great hand will lead me
To the mansions He’s gone to prepare.

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me, all the days

With each breath that you take

CHORUS
Oh repent today, 
and choose the right way, 
While the Master is calling and
you hear Him say 
Come unto me He’ll turn your night to day, 
If you reject His Word
There is no other way.

When a child of the King is being led
In the way of temptations in this world
Of the evil that surrounds, 
Then I’m so thankful for
God’s Spirit within
That keeps me from wand’ring 
And draws me unto Him."

Lord help me Jesus, I’ve wasted it
So help me Jesus, I know what I am
Now that I know 
that I've needed you 
So help me Jesus,

Try me Lord, if you think 
there’s a way
I can try to repay all I’ve taken

What I’ve been thru’ myself,
On my way back to you."

Have all faded from view,
There’s a new day ahead of me
All my heartaches are over
For I left them at Calvary
When my new life began.

CHORUS
I've come too far to look back 
My feet have walked thru’ the valley
I've climbed mountains, crossed rivers, 
Desert places I know, 
But I'm nearing that home shore
Where the redeemed are rejoicing
Heaven angels are singing 
I've come too far to look back.

Just look around there's
no happiness
There’s no reason for living

Full of sorrow and fear
But turn around don’t look
back again,
Face the new day before you,
Place your heartaches in
Jesus Christ
He can mend broken hearts."

 there is only one King, 
There is only one Body,

He loves me, 
It's a love beyond all 
human understanding,

That bring me to my knees 
That’s just His way of telling me, 
He loves me.

If I’m Successful walking 
through these 
valleys,
He'll give me strength to climb 
the highest hill
My greatest strength comes through 
my darkest trials
And my greatest joy is knowing that
He can trust in me."

CHORUS
There'a a great magnet 
flying from above 
And there’s nothing to hold me 
here below,

As I gaze into the starry skies above 
How l marvel at the Mighty

Just to know He is living in my soul
is the greatest gift any man 
could own."

Nafasi, mali, ya maisha."
604;HEED GOD’S WARNING;;"The rain drops fell on the seventh day
After God had closed the door
The people then in fear did pray that 
Noah please open the door? 
The mocking stopped and the laughter 
ceased
When Judgment began to fall
Though the people cried ""have
mercy Lord""
But God would not hear their call.

CHORUS
So don’t wait, don’t hesitate
Heed the warning of God’s call
So don’t wait, don’t hesitate
For destruction is at hand
God shall come to Judge
the world
As He did then.

The fire fell in Abraham’s day
When Sodom was destroyed
Two angels went to Lot that day
And said warn your family
All went out but one look back
And judgment fell on her
So don’t look back just look ahead
To God and you won’t stray."

Two disciples sadly walked from Jerusalem, 
Talking to a stranger who taught

When they reached Emmaus,
 and blessing had been made,
 They knew it was Jesus when 
He broke the bread.

unto the Lord
There is no place I’d rather be
Than with ones who’ve been set free 
I’m so glad that I’m in God’s big family.

Now it can be just anywhere
Two or three are gathered there
That the Spirit of the Lord will
be there too
There’s no fellowship so sweet
There’s no thrill that can compare
With the thrill I feel whenever
God’s people meet.

On that great reunion day
When the Lord says come away
And the saints from every land
Will sweep through the gate
Joining loved ones round the Throne
As we’ll all be gathered home
That will be the greatest thrill
We’ve never known."
634;PSALMS 100:4;;"I will enter His gates with
thanks giving in my heart

made me glad.

He has made me glad x 2

Bwana ameifanya
Nitashukuru mimi ni huru."

for the world today, 
Above Him there’s no other,
Jesus Is the way x 2

I know you have questions 
at the corner of your mind 
Traces of discouragement 
and peace you cannot find 
Reflection of the old past 
seem to face you everyday 
But this one thing I do know, 
Jesus is the way.

I know you have mountains 
that you think you cannot climb 
I know your skies are dark 
you think the sun won’t shine 
In case you don’t know 
the Word of God is true 
And everything He promised 
He’ll do it for you."

Troubles come from time to time 
But, that’s all right, Am not the worrying type, 
because, I’ve got confidence, 
God Is gonna see me thru 
No matter what the case may be,

to our lives a revival.

Do you want to be 
freed from your sins 
Do you want to be 
washed from within
Do you want to start
once again
The man Jesus can do It all.

He says come to me all who labour 
and are heavy laden 
Take my yoke and learn from me,
 For my yoke is easy and 
my burden light

Am the true vine 
and my Father is the dresser
 And you are the branches 
I’m the Bread of Life and the resurrection
 And I’m the way and 
the truth and the light.

Jesus came to us, to save not to 
condemn you 
He lived a life of sorrows with joy
But be of cheer, 
He defeated the world x 2
The man Jesus can do It all."
638;NEVER THE SAME AGAIN;;"CHORUS
Never the same again
(now know)
I won’t be the same again
From the moment I
met Jesus
My new life began
And I Won’t be the same
(no never)
The same again.

I remember how He waited,
how He got me
From my own way
I used to wander on my way
But nothing worked out right
Till the day He made
me surrender
Jesus took my life
And I won’t be the same
(no never)
The same again.

He may take me through the valley
Even through I am His child
And the road He shows may be
rough and rugged for a while
But He takes my hei :t and
speaks the Word
That lightens up my way
And I won’t be the same
(no never)
The same again."

Sister, live a holy life.

There is a song I ought to sing 
within my heart 
The city for people who are 
born again, 
Born of water, spirit and the
 blood of the Lamb 
The city is for people who are 
born again.

Apostle Paul sang this song 
I sing The city is for people 
who are born again And so I sing 
to you this song my friends,
 The city is for people 
who are born again.

I have decided, Am gonna live 
like a believer,
Turn my back on the deciever,
Am gonna live what I Believe.
I have decided, being good is
just a fable,
I just can't cause am not able
Am gonna leave it to the Lord.

There is a wealth of good that 
I professed 
I said that I believed 
But deep inside I never changed, 
I guess I had been deceived ‘
Cause the voice inside kept
telling me
I'll change by and by
But the Spirit made it clear to me, 
That kind of life is lie.

So forget the game of being good,
And your self righteousness
Cause the only good inside
of your heart
Is the good that Jesus brings
When the world begins to see
you changed
Don’t expect them to applaud
Just put your eyes on Him and say,
I’ve become the work of God"

Never think that you’ll be forsaken
For you’ll be travelling on the
right road."

God’s love 
What can you do to be called 
His bride
Nothing you did, and nothing you 
can do
I’ll trust in His grace and let Him 
have His way.

When I look down at my life,
I just can’t see nothing good
When I hear Him say these words,
“You are perfect, you have no sin
What can I do, only to trust Him
And let Him have His way.

Now am not what I ought to be... 
Yet not what I used to be; 
But what made and brought 
the difference
Is His work in my life I’ll trust Him 
for my future 
For there is nothing I can do 
I will only let go and let Him 
have His way."

All that I have is His to control
Praise the Lord am in His plan.

He knew me before I knew Him
He knew just what I’ll go through
He wrote my name in the
Lamb’s Book of Life
Praise the Lord, am in His plan.

He had a good plan of my life
Before I thought of having one
He took me out of denominational 
chains
Praise the Lord am in His plan.

Praise the Lord, I am in His plan
No matter what may come on my way
With the world falling He’ll hide
me in His land
Praise the Lord, am in His plan."

For the words you speak
Are little seeds
When they’re planted, 
they will grow
And you’ll reap every seed
that you sow.

Our words can justify us
Or condemn us on that day
So why not say what God says
And sow the seed the right way.

Words of hate can kill
Words of love can heal
Words can make one glad
And words can make one cry.

And you’ll reap every seed 
That you sow."

 Spoken to us by God’s 
Prophet for this our day.

I will rest - at the close of the day; 
And I know there are joys that await me 
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

If for Christ I proclaim the glad story,
If I seek for His sheep gone astray;
I’m sure He will show me His glory,
When I’ve gone the last mile
of the way.

Here the dearest of ties we must sever; 
Tears of sorrow are seen every day; 
But no sickness, no sighing forever, 
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

 Let me watch as a winner of souls:
That bright star may be mine in the 
glorious day 
When His praise like the 
sea billow rolls.

Oh what joy it will be when His 
face I behold, 
Living gems at His feet to lay down;

Hold me in your loving arms

and take my pride
Hold me to your love

For me He paid the great price.

For on the Rock of Ages it stands
I feel it is almost completed,
And ready for me to move In.

My evil deeds were all forgiven
By the Rock of Ages my Lord;
And my name was engraved
in gold letters,
In tha Lamb’s Book of Life, safe within

Where from this life I shall go
I’m waiting for Jesus to call me,
Then I'll lay down my cross
and go home."

By helping my brother Struggling

was wrong in my life.

To the God of my fathers
Creator of heaven and earth
God of the universe
He’s Jesus to me, Eternal Deity

To Yahweh of Judah
On my knees I did fall
Where the wall now stands
The lesson I’ve learned
As I walk my way homewards
The Saviour of all
Is the comfort of man.

I have returned
To the father of Abraham
The Shepherd of Moses
Who called Him the Great I Am

To the God of Brother Branham

When He heard you Pilate say
To the hill take Him away
There He paid sin’s awful cost
With His back to the cross.

CHORUS
When your back is to the wall 
Remember His was to the cross
The grave lost its victory
And old man death, where’s your sting?
When God gave His only son 
Your every battle then was won
So when your back is to the wall
Remember His was to the cross.

When your tears fall like rain
And you lose more than you gain
If in your life there is no song
When all you need the most is gone
When all is said and done
You’ve not lost, but you’ve won
So when your back is to the wall
Remember His was to the cross."

His heart Is touched with my grief:
When the days are weary, 
the long nights dreary,
I know my Saviour cares

Does Jesus care 
when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
 As the daylight fades
Into the deep night shades, 
Does He care enough to be near?

Does Jesus care 
when I've tried and failed,
To resist some temptation strong; 
When in my deep grief
I find no relief,
Tho’ my tears flow all the night long?

when I've said ""good-bye,""
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches
Till it nearly breaks
Is this aught to Him? Does He see?"

To be a servant called out,
To raise a standard He’s called you out
To raise the banner called out,
To be a witness called out,
To show forgiveness called out,
From the world, child you’ve been called out.

Within the prison, walls that day,
The jailer had bound up their feet,

Gentle Shepherd, do not leave me,
I need your eyes, to find my way;
Gentle Shepherd, do not leave me;
I need your feet, that I may never stray.
In your pastures, there is manna;
For my hungry, thirsty soul;
There is refuge, and tender mercy;
There is life, like I have never known!

The hours go by, on frightened
wings of flight;
While wolves of hell are waiting, 
for the night;
To claim the soul that wanders, 
from the fold;
Oh Gentle Shepherd, hear 
my cry and save my soul.

Oh Gentle Shepherd, hear 
my lonely cry;
And in thy cool green pastures, 
let me lie;
Beside the still clear waters, 
lead thou me
Oh Gentle Shepherd, 
safe forevermore with thee.

If I wander, from your pasture;
Lord bring me back, into the fold:
Gentle Shepherd, Great Provider,
For everything, dear to my soul."
748;GOD WILL MAKE THIS TRIAL A BLESSING;;"I've just come into a valley
One like I’ve never been before
I keep searching for a way out
Seems like padlocks are on the door
Oh! There must be another sunrise
Another sunset that I see
God will make this trial a blessing
That’s the love He has for me


CHORUS
God will make this trial a blessing
Though it sends me to my knees
Though my tears flow like a river
Yet in Him there’s sweet relieve
There’s no need to get discouraged
There’s no need to talk defeat
God will make this trial a blessing
And the whole wide world will see


I was Not the first one
To come into this place
You see every son of God
This test He must face
It is here that God will mould you
And make you what you ought to be
God will make this trial a blessing
Just be patient you will see


Now I'm standing on a mountain
Looking back, I can see
When I was in that lowest valley
His strong hand was leading me
Oh! It's good to see the sunrise
And to taste sweet victory
God has made my trial a blessing
Oh the grace He gives to me"

While the dew
Is still on the roses
And the voice I hear
Falling on my ears
Within my heart discloses

And He walks
With me and He talks with me
And he tells me that I am His own
And the joy we share
As we tarry there
None other has ever known.

He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet! The birds hush their singing
And the melody
That he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

I’d stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be falling
But He bids me go
Through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling."

would surely be me

But I can't even walk, 
without you holding my hand

CHORUS
Lord I can't even walk, 
without you holding my hand
Mountains too high, and the 
valleys too wide
Down on my knees, I've learnt to stand
Because I can't even walk, 
without you holding my hand

I thought I could do, a lot 
on my own
I thought I could 
make it, all alone
I thought of myself, 
as a mighty big man
(But one day I found out that)
 I can't even walk, 
without you holding my hand"
751;DO YOU KNOW GRACE?;;"I was down as low as one could go
I had no strength of my own;
Everything I worked for all my life
Everything I loved was gone;
The lowest valley of my life.
I was flat on my face
But then the great hand of Jesus
Reached down and picked me up
Oh yes, I know grace.

CHORUS
Do you know grace, amazing grace?
Have you heard how sweet the sound?
There are many dangers toils and snares,
We’ve already faced,
Look where you came from,
And where you are,
And I’ll ask you, 
Do you know grace?


When it comes time for Him to take His Bride,
To that evergreen shore,
And He chooses you and I,
To live in that land forevermore;
When we’ve been there ten thousand years
And you see me in that place
Oh! you could ask me this question again,
I’ll say  Yes! I remember grace"

724;STAY BETWEEN THE WHITE LINES;;"I remember when I was a little child,
Down on an old country farm,
We'd go to church on Sunday,
And I'd hear the preacher say,
If you want to see my Jesus,
You've gotta stay on the Kings Highway.

This Highway leads to glory,
And it's no easy ride,
You'll find all kinds of exits,
They'll throw you off your stride,
Some will lead to fortune,
And others lead to fame,
Some will lead you so far off,
You won't return again.

Chorus:
Oh you just stay between the white lines,
Obey all the right signs,
Keep your eyes opened all the time.
Oh you just stay between the white lines,
Never pine for the yellow lines,
And you'll get to Heaven right on time.

Satan's on this Highway,
He walks on every side,
Trying to flag you down,
Don't give him a ride,
He will try and stop you,
At just any sign,
You may stop too long,
And your soul may be lost."
706;IT WILL BE WORTH IT AFTER ALL;;"We need our spirit filled preachers,
To teach us right from wrong,
We need our old fashioned seekers,
Who'll pray all night long,
We need some good gospel singing,
To help us go another mile,
The church will triumph on,
And go Home in a little while.

chorus
It will be worth it after all Church, 
It will be worth it after all,
After all of these trials, We'll hear 
Jesus call,
It will be worth it after all Church,
It will be worth it after all,
After all of these trials it will be worth it 
after all.

When you're down in the valley,
Pray is all I can do,
And the Lord sends deliverance,
And strength to endure,
Now if you're up on the mountain,
And see me struggling along,
Lift my Name up to Jesus,
Let's help each other to make it Home."

733;WHERE THERE'S A DEEP, DEEP CALLING;;"We see the trees in winter 
The green has turned brown and red, 
But there is a promise of spring time, 
When life will be made anew 
It speaks of a resurrection morning
It shows that Gods Word is true

CHORUS:
Where there's a deep deep calling
There's a deep deep to respond
Where theres a hope for a city
Theres a land beyond the sky
Where theres a yearning, burning
Just to leave this old world that we know
There is a King returning
Coming to take us Home

Gods Son had to die and be buried, 
But in Luther it started to sprout, 
For the work had began drawn forth by the sun,
The message of faith brought it out, 
Then came the stalk by John Wesley, 
The Holy Ghost made the wheat grow, 
Then the chaff and the wheat separated, 
Gods seventh angels word made this so.

Each one must come to his winter 
But God for His children has said, 
That though they may lay us beneath the cold ground, 
The life that was there isn't there, 
For we have a promise of spring time, 
When life will be made anew
We’ll leave on the resurrection morning,
We’ll sail beyond the sun"

And teach me to pray
If I’ve murmured or grumbled

CHORUS
For I would grow careless
And I would not fear

And  I'd never shed a tear
Lest I forget that I need Thee

Don’t take my burdens
Or my cross away.

With the cross on my shoulders

When it came time to cross    
The waters of the mighty Red Sea    
And as the enemy drew nigh    
The children of Israel cried    
But God said, Speak, why cry to Me


CHORUS
So I'm going to speak the Word    
And move forth in faith    
When I’m challenged by the enemy    
I’ll cast down doubts and fears    
And when troubles come 
God said, ""Just put your trust in Me    
For I’m your buckler and shield    
In Me just believe    
And all that you need I’ll supply
I’m  your exceeding great reward
You have ‘Thus saith the Lord’    
So speak Bride,   
You speak and don’t cry


Malachi 4, he saw the opossum at his  door   
And spoke forth a healing in love   
The squirrels in the woods   
The bear in the grass  
The storm went back from where it came
The boy in Finland got his life   
John Ryan got his sight   
And Hattie, her two boys were saved  
Because a prophet she held fast   
‘Thus saith the Lord’ must come to pass   
So he spoke and went forth in God’s name


Little Gentile Bride     
We were taken from His side     
And our redemption, the Lord fully paid     
And when He died on that cross

Was restored to us once again     
So with the Token we can stand     
The Title Deed in our hands     
Launch forth and stake your claim
‘Thus saith the Lord’ could never fail     
God’s Word must prevail     
So speak and go forth in His name


Oh I said, Speak and don’t cry     
Speak and don’t cry     
Speak and don’t cry to me     
You've got to speak forth your healing 
And then go believing    
Speak Bride and you will see    
You've got to speak forth your deliverance 
From every bondage and hindrance    
Speak and you will see

Help me dear Saviour Thee to own
And ever faithful be;
And when Thou sittest on Thy Throne
O Lord remember me.


Was it for sins that I had done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity, grace unknown,
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
 And shut his glories in, 
When Christ, the Mighty Maker,
 died
For man, the creature’s sin.


Thus might I hide my blushing face
And shut His glories in
When Christ the mighty Maker died
For man the creature's sin.

To perfect faith and love
To perfect hope and peace and trust

Tis Jesus who confirms
The blessed work within
By adding grace to welcomed grace
Where reigned the power of sin.

And He the witness gives
To loyal hearts and free
That every promise is fulfilled
If faith but brings the plea.

And that He died for me.

Enough for me that Jesus saves

A sinful soul I come to Him
He'll never cast me out.

My heart is leaning on the Word
The written Word of God

For me His life  He gave."

Oh let me feel Thee near me

The tempting sounds I hear
My foes are ever near me
Around me and within

And shield my soul from sin.

Oh let me hear Thee speaking
In accents clear and still
Above the storms of passion
The murmurs of self-will

To hasten or control
Oh speak and make me listen
Thou Guardian of my soul.

To all who follow Thee
That where Thou art in glory

always in His plan."

Who, being in the form of God, 
thought it not robbery to be 
equal with God: 
But made himself of no reputation, 
and took upon him the form of a 
servant,

Yet grew worse, so to Jesus she came
And when the crowd tried to restrain her
She whispered these words through 
her pain

To show forth His greatness in 
this our day,

And on the morrow when 
he departed, 
he took out two pence, 
and gave them to the host,

Take care of him; 
and whatsoever thou 
spendest more, 
when I come again, 
I will repay thee.


Which now of these three,

If you'll just give Him residence
Let Him live inside of You

But I've already won the war

When you're afraid and all alone
And think that no one cares
And the daily task of getting by
Has caused you to despair
Just take God's word  into your heart
And know His promise stands
I may lose a battle now and then
But the victorys in God's Hands"

With his eyes plucked out
Here stands the man with all of his stature 
But with no power in his life
Raised up by God and given power 
To put to flight the armies of the enemy

But gave away all of his secrets 
Was now bound and in captivity
In the book of his remembrance 
Were all the great 
victories he had won
Realizing his present condition 
From deep down inside this cry began

Chorus
Just once more, Lord
Just once more, Lord
So we can see your power 
moving once again
Just once more, Lord

Repenting of all mistakes and failures
Praying in his heart Lord let me die
Not considering what it would cost him
Should God hear and  would 
answer his sincere cry
For he could feel his locks had grown out
Thinking is there a possibility 
of the power of God coming back
Began to cry, to cry more earnestly

Inagurated at Pentecost
Signs and wonders, 
manifestation of His name
But then at the council of Nicea
The early church had its locks shaved
But With a promise of retoration
We have seen God’s church rise in 
power through each stage
Until God sent to us a prophet

And we have seen the fullness 
of God’s life on display
But its been so long since 
the eyes have gone out
And there is a new crop 
that is coming forth
For greater works and dynamic 
power to be displayed
May we as Samsons of God 
cry just once more"

Friends it is not these old world's pleasures,

It is not this earthly kingship,
And I thank God for all my friendships,
Oh!, but my Jesus, is so precious to me.

I long for You.

And I did say I'll always help  you fight.

Coz you know I made a promise that I intend to keep
My grace will be sufficient in every time of need
My love will be the anchor that you can hold on to
This is the promise, this is the promise,  I've made to you


I never said that friends would never turn their backs on you
Or that the world around you wouldn't see you as a fool
But I did say like me, you'd surely be despised
And Idid say, my ways confound the wise
I didn't say you'd never taste the bitter kiss of death
Or have to walk thru chilly Jordan to enter into rest
But I did say I'd be waiting right on the other side
And I did say l'll dry every tear you cry


Coz u know I made a promise that I've prepared a place
And someday sooner than you think you'll see me face to face
And you'll sing with the angels and a countless multitude
This is  the promise, this is the promise I've made to you
So just keep on walking don't turn turn to the left or right
And in the midst of darkness let this be your light
That hell can't separate us and  you're gonna make it thru
This is the promise, this is the promise I've made to you,
Oh this is the promise, this is the promise I've made to you."

Or shall you scorn from His foes to fly?
Daring for Jesus to live or die

Feelings lie buried that grace can restore
Touched by a loving heart wakened by kindness

Back to the narrow way patiently win them
Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died."

she is his new creation

and for her life he died. 

Elect from every nation, 
yet one o'er all the earth; 
her charter of salvation, 
one Lord, one faith, one birth; 
one holy name she blesses, 
partakes one holy food, 
and to one hope she presses, 
with every grace endued. 

Though with a scornful wonder 
we see her sore oppressed, 
by schisms rent asunder, 
by heresies distressed, 
yet saints their watch are keeping; 
their cry goes up, ""How long?"" 
And soon the night of weeping 
shall be the morn of song. 

Mid toil and tribulation, 
and tumult of her war, 
she waits the consummation 
of peace forevermore; 
till, with the vision glorious, 
her longing eyes are blest, 
and the great church victorious 
shall be the church at rest. 

Yet she on earth hath union 
with God the Three in One,

in this his glorious day.
Ye that are brave now serve him 
against unnumbered foes;
let courage rise with danger, 
and strength to strength oppose.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
stand in his strength alone;
the arm of flesh will fail you,

Put on the gospel armor, 
each piece put on with prayer;
where duty calls or danger, 
be never wanting there.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,

With salvation's walls surrounded, 
thou mayst smile at all thy foes. 

See, the streams of living waters, 
springing from eternal love, 
well supply thy sons and daughters, 
and all fear of want remove.
Who can faint while such a river 
ever will their thirst assuage? 
Grace which like the Lord, the giver, 
never fails from age to age. 

Round each habitation hovering, 
see the cloud and fire appear 
for a glory and a covering, 
showing that the Lord is near! 
Thus deriving from our banner 
light by night and shade by day, 
safe we feed upon the manna 
which God gives us when we pray. 

Blest inhabitants of Zion, 
washed in our Redeemer's blood; 
Jesus, whom our souls rely on, 
makes us monarchs, priests to God. 
Us, by his great love, he raises, 
rulers over self to reign, 
and as priests his solemn praises 
we for thankful offering bring."

I am weak, but thou art mighty;

feed me till I want no more; 
feed me till I want no more.

Open now the crystal fountain, 
whence the healing stream doth flow; 
let the fire and cloudy pillar 
lead me all my journey through.  
Strong deliverer, strong deliverer, 
be thou still my strength and shield; 
be thou still my strength and shield.

When I tread the verge of Jordan, 
bid my anxious fears subside;

I love to tell the story,

and that is just the reason 
I tell it now to thee.  
	

I love to tell the story; 
'tis pleasant to repeat 
what seems, each time I tell it, 
more wonderfully sweet.  
I love to tell the story, 
for some have never heard 
the message of salvation 
from God's own holy Word.  
	

I love to tell the story, 
for those who know it best

to hear it like the rest.

light and love upon my way, 
from the cross the radiance streaming 
adds more luster to the day. 

Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure, 
by the cross are sanctified; 
peace is there that knows no measure, 
joys that through all time abide. 

In the cross of Christ I glory, 
towering o'er the wrecks of time; 
all the light of sacred story 
gathers round its head sublime."
924;JESUS CALLS US O'ER THE TUMULT;;"Jesus calls us o'er the tumult 
of our life's wild, restless sea; 
day by day his sweet voice soundeth, 
saying, ""Christian, follow me!"" 

As of old the apostles heard it 
by the Galilean lake, 
turned from home and toil and kindred, 
leaving all for Jesus' sake. 

Jesus calls us from the worship 
of the vain world's golden store, 
from each idol that would keep us, 
saying, ""Christian, love me more!"" 

In our joys and in our sorrows, 
days of toil and hours of ease, 
still he calls, in cares and pleasures, 
""Christian, love me more than these!"" 

Jesus calls us! By thy mercies, 
Savior, may we hear thy call, 
give our hearts to thine obedience, 
serve and love thee best of all."
925;JESUS LOVER OF MY SOUL;;"Jesus, lover of my soul, 
let me to thy bosom fly, 
while the nearer waters roll, 
while the tempest still is high. 
Hide me, O my Savior, hide, 
till the storm of life is past; 
safe into the haven guide; 
O receive my soul at last. 

Other refuge have I none, 
hangs my helpless soul on thee; 
leave, ah! leave me not alone, 
still support and comfort me. 
All my trust on thee is stayed, 
all my help from thee I bring; 
cover my defenseless head 
with the shadow of thy wing.

Thou, O Christ, art all I want, 
more than all in thee I find; 
raise the fallen, cheer the faint, 
heal the sick, and lead the blind. 
Just and holy is thy name, 
I am all unrighteousness; 
false and full of sin I am; 
thou art full of truth and grace. 

Plenteous grace with thee is found, 
grace to cover all my sin; 
let the healing streams abound, 
make and keep me pure within. 
Thou of life the fountain art, 
freely let me take of thee; 
spring thou up within my heart; 
rise to all eternity."
926;JESUS SAVIOUR PILOT ME;;"Jesus, Savior, pilot me
over life's tempestuous sea;
unknown waves before me roll,
hiding rock and treacherous shoal.
Chart and compass come from thee;
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

As a mother stills her child,
thou canst hush the ocean wild;
boisterous waves obey thy will,
when thou sayest to them, ""Be still!""
Wondrous sovreign of the sea,
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

When at last I near the shore,
and the fearful breakers roar
'twixt me and the peaceful rest,
then, while leaning on thy breast,
may I hear thee say to me,
""Fear not, I will pilot thee."""
927;JOYFUL JOYFUL WE ADORE THEE;;"Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, 
God of glory, Lord of love; 
hearts unfold like flowers before thee, 
opening to the sun above.  
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; 
drive the dark of doubt away.  
Giver of immortal gladness, 
fill us with the light of day!

All thy works with joy surround thee, 
earth and heaven reflect thy rays, 
stars and angels sing around thee, 
center of unbroken praise.  
Field and forest, vale and mountain, 
flowery meadow, flashing sea, 
chanting bird and flowing fountain, 
call us to rejoice in thee.

Thou art giving and forgiving, 
ever blessing, ever blest, 
well-spring of the joy of living, 
ocean depth of happy rest!  
Thou our Father, Christ our brother, 
all who live in love are thine; 
teach us how to love each other, 
lift us to the joy divine.

Mortals, join the mighty chorus 
which the morning stars began; 
love divine is reigning o'er us, 
binding all within its span.  
Ever singing, march we onward, 
victors in the midst of strife; 
joyful music leads us sunward, 
in the triumph song of life."
928;LET US PLEAD FOR FAITH ALONE;;"Let us plead for faith alone, 
faith which by our works is shown; 
God it is who justifies, 
only faith the grace applies.

Active faith that lives within, 
conquers hell and death and sin, 
hallows whom it first made whole, 
forms the Savior in the soul.

Let us for this faith contend, 
sure salvation is the end; 
heaven already is begun, 
everlasting life is won. 


Only let us persevere 
till we see our Lord appear, 
never from the Rock remove, 
saved by faith which works by love."
929;LO HE COMES WITH CLOUDS DESCENDING!;;"Lo, he comes with clouds descending, 
once for favored sinners slain;
thousand, thousand saints attending 
swell the triumph of his train. 
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
God appears on earth to reign. 

Every eye shall now behold him, 
robed in dreadful majesty; 
those who set at naught and sold him,
pierced and nailed him to the tree, 
deeply wailing, deeply wailing, deeply wailing, 
shall the true Messiah see. 

The dear tokens of his passion 
still his dazzling body bears; 
cause of endless exultation 
to his ransomed worshipers; 
with what rapture, with what rapture, with what rapture, 
gaze we on those glorious scars! 

Yea, Amen! Let all adore thee, 
high on thy eternal throne; 
Savior, take the power and glory, 
claim the kingdom for thine own.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
Everlasting God, come down!"
930;GOD OUR HELP IN AGES PAST;;"O God, our help in ages past, 
our hope for years to come, 
our shelter from the stormy blast, 
and our eternal home.

Under the shadow of thy throne, 
still may we dwell secure; 
sufficient is thine arm alone, 
and our defense is sure.

Before the hills in order stood, 
or earth received her frame, 
from everlasting, thou art God, 
to endless years the same.

A thousand ages, in thy sight, 
are like an evening gone; 
short as the watch that ends the night, 
before the rising sun.

Time, like an ever rolling stream, 
bears all who breathe away; 
they fly forgotten, as a dream 
dies at the opening day.

O God, our help in ages past, 
our hope for years to come; 
be thou our guide while life shall last, 
and our eternal home."
931;SAVIOUR LIKE A SHEPHERD LEAD US;;"Savior, like a shepherd lead us, 
much we need thy tender care; 
in thy pleasant pastures feed us, 
for our use thy folds prepare. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Thou hast bought us, thine we are. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Thou hast bought us, thine we are. 

We are thine, thou dost befriend us, 
be the guardian of our way; 
keep thy flock, from sin defend us, 
seek us when we go astray. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Hear, O hear us when we pray. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Hear, O hear us when we pray. 

Thou hast promised to receive us, 
poor and sinful though we be; 
thou hast mercy to relieve us, 
grace to cleanse and power to free. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
We will early turn to thee. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
We will early turn to thee. 

Early let us seek thy favor, 
early let us do thy will; 
blessed Lord and only Savior, 
with thy love our bosoms fill. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Thou hast loved us, love us still. 
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus! 
Thou hast loved us, love us still."
932;THE KING OF LOVE;;"The King of love my shepherd is, 
whose goodness faileth never.  
I nothing lack if I am his, 
and he is mine forever.

Where streams of living water flow, 
my ransomed soul he leadeth; 
and where the verdant pastures grow, 
with food celestial feedeth.

Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed, 
but yet in love he sought me; 
and on his shoulder gently laid, 
and home, rejoicing, brought me.

In death's dark vale I fear no ill, 
with thee, dear Lord, beside me; 
thy rod and staff my comfort still, 
thy cross before to guide me.

Thou spreadst a table in my sight; 
thy unction grace bestoweth; 
and oh, what transport of delight 
from thy pure chalice floweth!

And so through all the length of days, 
thy goodness faileth never; 
Good Shepherd, may I sing thy praise 
within thy house forever."
933;WONDERFUL WORDS;;"Sing them over again to me, 
wonderful words of life; 
let me more of their beauty see, 
wonderful words of life; 
words of life and beauty 
teach me faith and duty. 

CHORUS 
Beautiful words, wonderful words, 
wonderful words of life. 
Beautiful words, wonderful words, 
wonderful words of life. 

Christ, the blessed one, gives to all 
wonderful words of life; 
sinner, list to the loving call,
wonderful words of life; 
all so freely given, 
wooing us to heaven. 
	

Sweetly echo the gospel call, 
wonderful words of life; 
offer pardon and peace to all, 
wonderful words of life; 
Jesus, only Savior, 
sanctify forever."
934;OH HOW MARVELLOUS!;;"I stand amazed in the presence 
	of Jesus the Nazarene, 
	and wonder how he could love me, 
	a sinner, condemned, unclean. 

                CHORUS
	How marvelous! How wonderful! 
	And my song shall ever be:
	How marvelous! How wonderful 
	is my Savior's love for me! 

	For me it was in the garden 
	he prayed: ""Not my will, but thine."" 
	He had no tears for his own griefs, 
	but sweat-drops of blood for mine. 
	(Refrain) 

	In pity angels beheld him, 
	and came from the world of light 
	to comfort him in the sorrows 
	he bore for my soul that night. 
	

	He took my sins and my sorrows, 
	he made them his very own; 
	he bore the burden to Calvary, 
	and suffered and died alone. 
	

	When with the ransomed in glory 
	his face I at last shall see, 
	'twill be my joy through the ages 
	to sing of his love for me."
935;LOVING GOD, LOVING EACH OTHER;;"Chorus
Loving God, loving each other,
Making music with my friends;
Loving God, loving each other,
And the story never ends.

They pushed back from the table
To listen to His words,
His secret plan before He had to go.
It's not complicated;
Don't need a lot of rules,
This is all you'll need to know.


We tend to make it harder,
Build steeples out of stone,
Fill with explanations of The Way,
But if we'd stop and listen
And break a little bread,
We would hear the Master say"
936;I'LL NEVER BE LONELY AGAIN;;"Lonely days and lonely nights
Filled with despair
Caused me to long for someone
who cares
Then I heard Christ say to me
This promise I'v made
Lo I am with you now and forever
Be not afraid.


Chorus
I'll never be lonely
again,
Never again, 
For I have opened my heart
door to him
So I'll brush away my fears
And forget my foolish ways
I'll never be lonely again,
Never again.

If you're longing for a friend
loving and true
Turn to the Saviour He's waiting
For you,
He will do the same for you
As He did for me
He'll never leave you, never
forsake you
Trust Him and see."
937;JUST CRY OUT FOR MERCY;;"You seem so uncertain
Just where to begin
You're afraid of betrayal,
But you're needing a friend,
You say your situation
Is entirely your fault
Thro one foolish error
It seems all is lost

Chorus
Just cry out for mercy
Jesus still saves
Though we're not worthy
He'll never turn you away
And if you're lonely
He'll hear when you pray
Just cry out for mercy
Jesus still saves

A moment of weakness
And a life of regret
Oh it's never easy 
To forgive and forget
Your accusers around you
They point fingers of men
But He won't condemn you
If you'll just whisper His Name"
938;BACK TO THE CROSS UNDER THE BLOOD;;"Sometimes the vision gets 
clouded in view
When we begin taking our life's 
overview
But there's a place we can go 
to renew our first love
Back to the cross and under 
the blood

With the world on the outside 
and Jesus within
There's always temptations 
to give up or give in
And when you feel the enemy 
come in like a flood
Go back to the cross and 
under the blood


Chorus
Back to the cross where 
victory is won
And under the blood where 
healing is done
Where we can always find rest 
his mercies and love
When we go back to the cross 
and under the blood

Now if you don't know him
Provision is made
For the price of redemption is 
already paid
And there's room for one more beneath 
that soul cleansing flood
It's back to the cross and under the blood"
939;BACK TO THE CROSS;;"Sometimes the vision, gets clouded and dim
When we begin taking, our eyes off of Him
But there's a place we can go
To renew our first love
Back to the Cross 
And under the Blood.
With the world on the outside
And Jesus within
There's always temptation 
to give up or give in
And when you feel the enemy 
come in like a flood
Go back to the cross,
Under the Blood.

CHORUS
Back to the cross, where victory is won
And under the Blood, where healing is done
There we can always find grace

940;WHO WILL BE JESUS;;"He came home from work last night
To find that she was gone
Now he's spending his first Sunday
Sitting in the pew alone
There are whispers all around him
His heart breaks in two
He's wondering who will reach out
And help him make it through

Who will be Jesus to him
Who'll show the love that 
restores him again
He doesn't need a judge 
he needs a friend
Who will be Jesus to him

She has a reputation like
the woman at the well
The only love she's ever known
Is the kind she buys or sells
But her thirsty heart is searching
For a love that will be true
The Saviour cries for her to see 
Himself in me and you

Who will be Jesus to her
Who'll show the love that's 
commanded in His Word
Will she see in us the 
mighty God we serve
Who will be Jesus to her

Who will be Jesus to them
Who'll show the love that 
restores them again
They do not need a judge 
they need a friend
Who will be Jesus to them"

it will never lose its power

CHORUS
It reaches to the highest mountain
and it flows to the lowest valley
the blood that gives me strength
from day to day,
it will never lose its power

It soothes my doubt and
calms my fears
and it dries all my fears
the blood that gives me strength
from day to day,
it will never lose its power"
1132;MY BRAND NEW HOME;;"If you are awed by this world  
and all it's beauty
Many stately mansions daily you 
may see
But without great wealth I know 
I will never own one
You're no more rich than me

But if your soul will look beyond 
what man is building
You may see what earthly mortals 
can not see
For on the other side of Jordan 
there's construction of a mansion being 

Just wait till you see my brand 
new home. 
When you see it’s beauty rare 
nothing down here can compare. 
Just wait till you see my brand 
new home.
My heavenly Father’s building me, 
And am gonna occupy for Free, 
Just wait’ll you see, 
my brand new home.

My new home will not be set upon 
foundation
that are made and will someday 
pass away 
It won't be built where the 
storms of life can batter
And where the rain clouds often hide
the light of the day

But the cornerstone of God is my 
foundation
The Root of David Christ the Lord 
my coming King 
What a welcome and homecoming 
now awaits me 
And I'm expecting any day  to move right in

Just wait till you see my brand 
new home. 
When you see it’s beauty rare 
nothing down here can compare.

Oh the precious love of Jesus
How it thrills my ransomed soul
More and more I’ll sing His praises
While the happy ages roll

When the tempter tries to win me
Something keeps me true and strong
It is love, my Saviour’s love
Something makes my life a blessing
To the needy in the throng
It is love, my Saviour’s love

When misfortune overtakes me
Something calms my troubled soul
It is love, my Saviour’s love
Something draws my soul to Heaven
That sweet land of peace and rest
It is love, my Saviour’s love

Souls astray and bowed in sorrow
Something waits for you today.

It would give you peace  and comfort
Make your burdens roll away
It is love, my Saviour’s love"
1134;A PRISONER OF LOVE;;"Am a man born free,

 Lord, I don't want to be free.

CHORUS
I don't want to be free 
from the task thatYou gave me
I don't want to be free, Lord, 
from the load I've to share
Its weight may be heavy, 
but it's a privilege to bear it
Am a prisoner of love now, 
and I don't want to be free."
1135;CONSIDER THE LILIES;;"Consider the lilies , they  don't toil or spin
But there's not a king with more splendor.
Consider the sparrows,
 they don't sow or store
But are fed of the Master 
who watches them grow

CHORUS
We have a Heavenly Father above
With eyes full of mercy 
And a heart full of love
He really cares when your 
head is bowed low
Consider the lilies 
and there you will know

May I introduce you to this friend of mine?
Who hangs up the stars, 
tells the sun when to shine
He kisses the flowers
each morning with dew
But He's not too busy to care about you."
1136;I could sing of Your love forever;;"Over the mountains and the hills
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the Healer set me free
Am happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing 
Of when Your love came down

CHORUS
I could sing of Your love forever

It's foolishness I know
But when the world has seen the Light
They will dance with joy

And really saved me
I have found a friend whose name is Jesus
In Him i found  life

My friend promised me and always reminds me
That one day He is coming to take me Home
He always tells me there in His  Father's house
Are many places for those who believe in Him

You can befriend Him because He loves you
And always calls you to come to Him
Give Him a chance to live inside you
And I know you will find He's a good friend."
1142;SPEAK THE WORD;;"If it's a foreign battlefield
Where I'll finally find your will
Lord, then that's where I long to be.
In the desert without a drink,
Or some old ship about to sink,
Lord, I'll go if you just speak to me.

CHORUS
Speak the word Lord,
My ears long to hear You.
Speak the word Lord,
My heart aches to know.
Speak the word Lord,
I'll be what You'll have me to be.
Speak the word Lord,
Your servant will go.

There are times  when I've complained
As life rubbed against the grain.
And I recall the times You took me to my knees.
But there's one thing That I couldn't do
So I still owe this thank to You
For it was You Who took my cross to Calvary"
1139;LISTEN TO MY HEART;;"How do you explain,
How do you describe,
A love that moves from east to west
And runs as deep as it is wide
You know all our hopes
Lord, You know all our fears.
And words cannot express 
the love we feel
But we long for You to hear

CHORUS
So listen to our hearts
Hear our spirits sing
A song of praise that flows
From those You have redeemed
We will use the words we know
To tell You what an awesome 
God You are
But if words are not enough
To tell You of our love
Just listen to our hearts.


If words could fall like rain
From these lips of mine
And if I had a thousand years
I would still run out of time
So if You listen to our hearts
Every beat will say
Thank You for the life
Thank You for the truth
Thank You for the way"

""Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh""
He cried

CHORUS
What God has joined together
 no man can put asunder
There is no power 
that can ever separate us from His love

Calvary brought a union
The blood in the Bride
Spirit of His Spirit
And life of His Life

But he doesn't understand
There's no power that can take her from His arms"

Sing Hallelujah, shout to the Lord
For You are the One, You are the One

We'd be singing together
Coz I can't wait for eternity
To praise Your Name forever

Abrand new one began
The day I found the cross
where Jesus died

And because of Calvary
I'll never be the same again 
I found the joy I never thought
could ever be 
He took a life shattered by sin
Put it together once again
And Oh what a change there's been
Because of Calvary

Now when my heart is sad
And growing weary
I journey in my mind,
back to Calvary
And I kneel beneath its flow
That washes white as snow
And I find new strength is waiting
there for me."

Its sweet song of morning
The leaves on the trees 
Turn their silver cups to the sky. 
The silent clouds above 
Are beginning to gather
The barren land is thirsty
And so am I.

CHORUS
It's beginning to rain
Hear the voice of the father
He's saying whosoever will
Come and drink of this water
He's promised to pour his spirit out
On your sons and your daughters
If you're thirsty and dry
Look up to the sky
It's beginning to rain. 


The young man's eyes start to shine 
As he tells of his vision
The old understands what he sees 
For he's dreamed his dreams 
With the thrill of being alive
They reach for each other
And they dance in the rain 
with the joy of the things 
That they've seen.

At the first drop of rain that you hear
Throw open the windows
Go call all the children to gather
Throw wide the door. 
When the rains of the Sprit are falling
Fill every vessel

Na mlango ukishafungwa
KWa sauti nitasema utukufu

Nearer to thee!
E'en though it be a cross
That raiseth me.
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!

Though like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone,
Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!

There let the way appear,
Steps unto heav'n;
All that thou sendest me,
In mercy giv'n;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!

Then with my waking thoughts
Bright with thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!

Or if, on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!"

 forty years he led them, 
Through the cold and through the night; 
Tho they said, ""Let's turn back"", 
Moses said, ""Keep goin', 
Canaanland is just in sight."" 

And there will be no sorrow 
there in that tomorrow, 
We will be there by and by; 
Milk and honey flowing there 
is where I'm going, 
Canaanland is just in sight. 

Now though we walk thru valleys, 
'Tho we climb high mountains, 
We can not give up the fight; 
We must be like Moses, 
we must keep on going; 
Canaanland is just in sight. 

And there will be no sorrow

So just stay on your position
And watch the miraculous come into action"
1153;UNTIL HE WAS ALL THAT I HAD;D / Dm;"The storm they were facing was fearful,
Their ship seemed so small in the waves
And the wind just kept blowing harder
And yet they were all so safe
From out of the dark He came walking
He had never lost them from view
He can see through the darkest of troubles
He just wantreed them to to see it too

CHORUS
That you'll never be filled till your emptied
Until your broken you'll never be whole
Until the potter has tried your vessel with fire
You'll never come forth as pure gold
I didn't know how much He loved me
Until I'd passed through the storm and looked back
I didn't know Jesus was all I needed
Until He was all that I had

Sometimes the storm that you are facing
May seem like your whole world has changed
And the fire keeps getting hotter
As the Potter is shaping the clay
Friends Jesus knows what He's doing
Even though it causes you pain
He just wants us to know the lesson 
He showed
His disciples is still the same"
1154;COMING SOON;;"CHORUS
Coming soon, Jesus and in his glory
 Not just a savior, but a reigning King 
Coming soon and the whole world 
will be witness 
Oh be ready, for he is coming soon

Once he came to this offer of sin
 and sorrow 
A humble baby in a manger, in Bethlehem 
But this time he's coming in all his power 
Great kings of earth, will bow and 
worship his great name 

And when he comes, he'll bind the
power of old satan 
Little children with the lamb and lion will play 
All the earth will be so filled, with his glory 
No need for crying, for all with tears 
are wiped away"
1155;NOTHING TO HINDER ME;;"One day I heard a voice
Saying make the Lord your choice
I'll take away your every sin
And set you free,
So I came to Him that day
And He took my sins away
Now I don’t want nothing here
to hinder me.

CHORUS
I don't want nothing here to hinder me 
For some day His blessed face 
I want to see, 
It makes no difference what the cost
Or how heavy my cross 
I don’t want nothing here to hinder me.

Many times I’m tossed about, 
Many times I do without 
And many times my heart is burdened 
down with care 
But I know if I stay true
Then some day He’ll see me through
If I don’t let nothing
here hinder me.

And someday when I get home
Where I never more shall roam
And the Blessed Savior's face I see
When He says,""My child, well done""
A crown of life you have won,
I'm so glad that nothing here did hinder me. 

You'll be glad nothing here hindered you
When you hear Him say
""My child you made it through""
You'll get to lay this old cross down
And you'll receive a crown of life
You'll be so glad that nothing here 
hindered you"

God could have chosen 
Who are better, than I
Those who knows the very movement, 
of the stars in the sky
But He looked deeper, 
than the appearance
And He saw me, sitting there
I'm only in this Message, by grace.

CHORUS
I'm only in this Message, by grace
It's only God's  grace, that I'm in this place
I don't know why, my Lord God chose me
But am thankful, anyway
I'm only in this Message, by grace.

So don't you worry, 
if you're sometimes not in
The Master's, decree
God sees, your deep desires
And He wants to, give you peace
By His precious side, 
we'll live all Eternally
It's not by might, 
but by His wonderful Name."
1158;WE ARE STANDING ON HOLY GROUND;;"When I walk through the doors 
 I sensed His presence 
 And I knew this was a place 
 where love abounds 
 For this is a temple the God 
 we love abides here

Vitu vyote vya dhamani kwetu,

Tutakase na utembee nasi,

Tu watu wa shingo ngumu tusamehe,
Hatufai mbele zako turehemu,
Tusafishe baba, tuonyeshe uso wako,
Mioyo yetu twaleta mbele zako,

Tunaomba utuonyeshe njia zako, 
Kwa maana umetuita kwa jina lako,
Twalilia e bwana, utukufu na uso wako,
Bila wewe tutashindwa enda nasi,"
1160;JESUS IS THE LIGHTHOUSE;;"There's a lighthouse on the hillside 
That overlooks life's sea 
When I'm tossed it sends out a light 
That I might see 
And the light that shines in darkness now 
Will safely lead us o'er 
If it wasn't for the lighthouse 
My ship would be no more 

CHORUS
And I thank God for the lighthouse 
I owe my life to Him 
Jesus is the lighthouse 
And from the rocks of sin 
He has shown a light around me 
That I might clearly see 
If it wasn't for the lighthouse 
Tell me where would this ship be

It seems that every one about us says, 
""Tear that old lighthouse down. 
The big ships just don't pass this way anymore, 
so there's no use in standin' round."" 
Then my mind goes back to that one dark, 
stormy night, 
when just in time I saw the light. 
Yes, it was the light from that old lighthouse, 
that stands up there on the hill."

You found me when I was so blue
You found me when no one could me
When no one knew just what to do

CHORUS
Let me walk with you Jesus
Don't ever ever leave me alone
For without you I could never 
Oh ever make heaven my home

I've been on the mountain with Jesus
I've been in the valley so low
But never one time has he failed
To Him with my troubles I go"
1162;AFTER ALL (BAADA YA YOTE);;"Katika dunia hii, sisi sote tu wageni

Baada ya taabu zote,
tulizozipata hapa
Tutapumzika milele kwa baba
Katika Yerusalem iliyopambwa vizuri
Ndugu jitahidi ili uwepo 
Dada jitahidi ili uwepo

Hatuna mashaka tena, 
tunaye aliye aliye mkuu
Kwani taabu shida mateso, kashinda
Pale pale msalabani, 
kamaliza mambo yote
Tumaini letu Wakristo, ni Ushindi"
1164;WHAT GOD CANNOT DO;;"When I came to the Lord I found 
He was able
To save me and give life anew
And though He's sovreign God 
over everything
His nature has proven there are some 
things that God cannot do

CHORUS
He can't say no to a sinner that prays 
for forgiveness
He cannot remember the sin in my past
And He cannot show a greater love than 
Calvary to you
Oh the things that God cannot do ...
Oh the things that God cannot do.

He's the alpha and omega the 
rock of all ages
The tower of hope through and through
But He cannot fail His promise 
I'll never forsake you
I'm amazed at what God cannot do

He can't be unfaithful and God cannot lie
He cannot refuse the righteous when they cry
God cannot be kept from those that He loves
By death by life, things below or above"
1165;NISHIKE MKONO NISIZAME;;"Safari ya imani na kutazama yesu
Nataka nifike ng'ambo salama
Lakini njiani mawimbi in mengi
Mashaka yanisonga kuniangamiza

Chorus
Nishike mkono nisizame
Mawimbi in mengi niokoe
Nishike mkono nisizame
Mawimbi in mengi niokoe

Mawimbi in Makali nahitaji msaada
Nishike mwokozi niwe salama
Wewe uliyeniita nakuja kwa neno lako
Napata kutembea kwa neno lako

Safari ya imani natembea kwa imani
Dhambi isinishinde nisaidie
Katika majaribu makali kama moto
Najua nitatoka kama dhahabu"
1166;THE EYES OF JESUS;;"Some times it seems God's a million 
miles away
Too busy for a creature such as I
And then I think of how He sees each 
sparrow fall
I call on Him and find that He is nigh

Chorus
The eyes of Jesus are upon each footstep 
that I take
His ears are always open when I pray
His hands are always there to help me lift 
my heavy load
His heart is broken every time I stray.

In valleys low I look toward the 
mountains high
And praise the Lord that caused this 
world to be.
To think that God so great holds me 
safe within His arms
What love that He should ever care for me"
1167;THAT'S WHY;E;"He knew we'd so be lost without Him
that's why He left Heaven's throne
to come as a child to the wicked and wild
not to condemn but atone
He knew that we needed forgiveness
that's why His mercy was free
when all hope was lost He became the cost
to ransom a sinner like me

Chorus
I am living in the promise
there is grace for every need
He knew that we needed a Savior
that's why His precious blood flowed
and I do believe every drop was for me
and that's why I love Him so

He knew that we all needed healing
that's why He took every stripe
the hammer and nails, the anguish He felt
was torment that should have been mine
but He could see hope in the making
for someone as hopeless as me
that's why He rose over death He imposed
so that I could forever go free"
1168;I NEED YOU MORE TODAY;;"There are decisions I can't make 
on my own,
And there are trials I can't face 
all alone,
But you said you'd walk with me,
Down life's troubled road,
And you said, ""Come unto Me,
I'll bear your heavy load.""

CHORUS
I need you more today,
Than I did yesterday,
Mountains are higher,
Rivers are wider,
I need you more today,
Than I did yesterday,
Help me remember,
I need you more today.


When I wake up in the morning,
And I fear to face the day,
Let me feel your gentle hand,
Leading the way,
For yesterday has come and gone,
With those trials far behind,
But I'm ever learning, Lord,
And every day I find."
1169;BENEATH THE FOUNTAIN;;"There's a fountain that is flowing 
From a place called Calvary 
There is healing in it's waters 
There is joy and victory 

Chorus 
Have you been beneath the fountain 
There's no other place to go 
Flowing down from Calvary's mountain 
It will wash you white as snow

Other waters will be bitter 
They just cannot satisfy 
But this fountain flows forever 
And it never shall run dry"
1170;THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST;;"The Bride of Christ is an oddball
She stands like a great speckled bird
She's sprinkled with the blood of her Husband
She's not ashamed of her mate

She's mocked by the world and the churches
She bears the reproach of the Word
She wears no make-up of Creeds and Dogmas
She wears the garment of the Word

The Bride is standing like a lady
She's dressed in an old fashioned way
But that's the way her husband likes it
He's coming to take his Bride away

The Bridegroom has placed in her finger
A ring of unmerited grace
The marriage certificate has been written
And that's the Lamb's Book of Life

The marriage has already been conducted
The Bridegroom came in '63
The marriage counsellor William Branham
Has joined the Bride to the Bridegroom

The Bride is married to one husband
She's dead to the world and denominations
She's pregnant with His word the 7 Seals
She'll manifest the Son, the Spoken Word

The Bride is going to the marriage supper
She'll meet her Bridegroom in the air
She'll be rejoicing for 3 ½ years, 
And then she'll come to the Millennium"
1171;REASSURE ME LORD;;"When i just can't see the sunshine 
for the many tears I've cried 
When I'm left alone to struggle 
and I've lost my will to try 
When the road ahead gets rocky 
and I fail to understand 
That's when I need reassurance 
that we're walking hand in hand 

CHORUS
Reassure me Lord, that your 
hand is guiding me 
Let me know the road I walk, 
is what you chose for me 
I need to hear Your Voice whisper 
to me peace be still 
And when the rivers all run dry, 
I walk through valleys deep and wide 
And when the mountain gets too high, 
reassure me 

So, you say your days are lonely 
and your nights bring only fear 
All the dreams you have dreamed, 
have crumbled and your smiles
 have turned to tears 
Friend there's no need for you to worry
when you've done all simply stand 
Soon you'll feel His Holy Presence 
and the touch of nail scarred hands"
1172;MAN IN THE MIDDLE;;"There was a mountain, 
there were three trees, 
there was a good man,
there were two thieves, 
a man called Barabbas, 
was doomed for the tree, 
but Jesus took the middle one, 
and Barabbas went free. 

CHORUS
And I love that man in the middle, 
oh because I know he first loved me, 
praise to that man who 
died on mount Calvary, 
the middle man made it 
possible that I could go free. 

A hill called Golgotha, 
the place of the skull, 
no yellow flowers, no trees in bloom, 
the scenery was so dull, 
three crosses stood black and bold, 
against the darken sky, 
not from pain but his broken heart, 
the middle man died."
1173;GONE;;"When Mary came to find the tomb of Jesus
The stone was moved, the Lord is risen
The angel said ""fear not, the Lord is risen
Don't seek the living here among the graves''

Gone, the stone is rolled back,
Gone, the tomb is empty
Gone, to sit at the Father's side
Gone, over death triumphant
Gone, sin is defeated
Gone, He lives forevermore.

Oh come with me and see the risen Savior
Who still can turn the dark of death to day
Who calms the storms of doubt
And parts the ocean
Oh he still can roll your heavy stones away

He's gone, the stone is rolled back
He's gone, the tomb is empty
He's in heaven sitting by the father's side
He's gone
Gone, over death triumphant
Jesus is gone
Gone, sin is defeated,
Jesus lives Forevermore"
1174;SITTING AT THE FEET;;"Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Oh, what words I hear Him say!
Happy place! so near, so precious!
May it find me there each day;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
I would look upon the past;
For His love has been so gracious,
It has won my heart at last.

Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Where can mortal be more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And, when weary, find sweet rest;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
There I love to weep and pray;
While I from His fullness gather
Grace and comfort every day.


Bless me, O my Savior, bless me,
As I sit low at Thy feet; [I'm waiting]
Oh, look down in love upon me,
Let me see Thy face so sweet;
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
Keep me holy as He is;
May I prove I've been with Jesus,
Who is all my righteousness."
1175;YOU DELIVER ME;;"Deep as the ocean, bright as rain
This powerful emotion lifts me up 
above the plain
It's taking me to places I never thought I'd go
Showing me a grace I never thought I'd know

CHORUS
When I feel like I can't go on
You deliver me
And when the road is winding and way too long
You deliver me, You deliver me, yeah

I feel like a sinner whose sins have been 
washed clean
An absolute beginner whose heart 
has never seen
I must be forgiven for sometimes asking why
I was chosen to be given You in this life

When there's a distance
Oh, between what I am
And who I wanna be
You deliver

When I feel like I can't go on
You deliver me
When the road is winding and way too long
You deliver me"
1176;SO MUCH TO THANK HIM FOR;;"When I look around and see
The good things He does for me
I know I’m unworthy of them all
And His blessings He freely gives
I owe my life to Him
I've got so much to thank Him for

Chorus
We'll I've got so much to thank Him for
So much to praise Him for
You see, He has been so good to me
When I think of what He’s done
And where He’s brought me from
I've got so much to thank Him for

And sometimes while on this way
I kneel and I stop and say
Lord, thank You for all You’ve done for me
And one day I'll reach Heaven’s shore
Oh please let me kneel once more
I've got so much to thank You for"
1177;I LOVE HIM TOO MUCH;;"When I first heard of Jesus
His Love and His Grace
My heart was overwhelmed
To think the King would take my place
I cried ""Lord, I'll go with You
Every step of the way
That's all I can do
My debt You repaid."". 

CHORUS
I love Him too much, to fail Him now
I love Him too much, to break my vow
For I promised the Lord
And I would make it somehow
And now I love Him too much
To fail Him now

Well, I told Him I love Him
It was so easy to say
But harder to prove
When temptations came my way
For what good are broken promises?
I counted them but loss
When I caught a glimpse of true Love
Hanging on a rugged cross

Now the years have brought us closer
My love for Him has grown
Each step has brought me nearer
To my Eternal home
Now I'm just too close to Heaven
To turn back now
He said His Grace will be sufficient
I'm gonna make it somehow"
1178;YOU RAISED ME UP;;"When I am down 
and ooh my soul so weary
When troubles comes
and my heart burdens me
and I am strong
while waiting In the silence
until you come
and sit a while with me

CHOROUS
You raised me up
 So I can stand on mountains
You raised me up
To walk on stormy seas
And I am strong
When I am on your shoulders
You raised me up 
To more than I can be"
1179;OUT OF TIME INTO ETERNITY;;"Storms of life are raging  
Gross darkness fills the earth 
There's strife among the nations 
Pestilence and famine 
And wars on every hand 
Violence sweeps through the lands 
But the Word of our Lord reveals a place
 of refuge 
Where the righteous can run and  
be saved 
When we're under the blood  
The death angel can't slay us 
We'll be safe till we're taken away 

CHORUS 
In a moment we'll be gone 
We'll be taken from this world 
Out of time into eternity 
Out of darkness into light 
Out of death into life 
Out of time into eternity 

Chaos and confusion 
Men's hearts are filled with fear 
As terror strikes around them 
Despite all the destruction 
They still cling to worldly cares 
They keep living in despair But the 
children of God 
Abides in peace and safety 
Far away from the oncoming storms 
In the cleft of the Rock 
We are completely sheltered 
As we wait for the last trump to sound 

BRIDGE 
There's come a time 
When the Spirit of God will depart 
Then none shall be healed none  
shall be saved 
This world is again falling apart  as our 
Prophet said 
So enter in now before it is too late

No more darkness only light 
No more death only life 
Out of time into eternity 
Spread your wings prepare for flight 
Faster than the speed of light  
Out of time into eternity"
1180;SOMETHING HOLDING ME;;"The trials of this world were getting closer,
The pull I felt was more than I could bear,
And I was on the verge of just giving over:
The strength within myself just wasn't there.

CHORUS
Something keeps holding me,
Everyday I see,
He's helping me faithfully
To overcome my trials;
He's guiding me constantly,
Giving me victory,
He's a reality;
Something keeps holding me.

Satan laid before me his temptation
Of his desire to steal away my faith,
But I have found in time the revelation,
The strength I need to keep me by His grace.

Jesus keeps holding me,
Everyday I see,

To overcome my trials;
He's guiding me constantly,
Giving me victory,
He's a reality;
Jesus keeps holding me."
1181;DIDN'T I WALK ON THE WATER;;"As I kneel in the darkness in the 
middle of the night
I'm praying for assurance everything's 
gonna be alright
Lord I see another battle out in front of me
I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down
in defeat

And He said, do you remember where
I brought you from
Just take a look behind you and see how 
far you've come
And everytime you asked me, didn't
I deliver you
So why would you be thinking that I wouldn't
see you through

CHORUS
Didn't I walk on the water and I calmed
 the raging sea
I spoke to the wind, and it hushed and I 
gave you peace
Didn't I run to your rescue didn't I hear you 
when you called
I walked right beside you just so 
you wouldn't fall
Didn't I leave all of Heaven just to die 
for your sin
I searched until I found you and I'd 
do it all again

Now she's talking to her father in a house
 that was once a home
She said my bills are coming due Lord and 
six days is not that long
She hears a voice so still and low
It says I've moved like that before
I'll do this little thing child and I'll give you 
so much more"
1182;STANDING ON HOLY GROUND;;"As I walked through the door, 
I sensed His presence 
And I knew this was a place where 
love abounds 
For this is the temple, Jehovah God 
abides here 
We are standing in His presence 
on holy ground 

CHORUS
We are standing on holy ground 
And I know there are angels all around 
Let us praise Jesus now 
We are standing in His presence 
on holy ground 

In His presence there is joy beyond 
all measure 
And at His feet peace of mind can still be found 
And if you have a need, I know He 
has the answer 
Reach out and claim it for we are standing 
on holy ground"
1183;JESUS I'LL NEVER FORGET;;"Jesus I'll never forget, what You've 
done for me
Jesus I'll never forget, how You've 
set me free
Jesus I'll never forget, how You've 
brought me out
Jesus I'll never forget, oh never

He brought me out 
of the miry clay, 
He set my feet on the Rock 
to stay; 
He puts a song in my 
soul today, 
A song of praise, hallelujah!

How can I forget, what You've 
done for me
How can I forget, how You've 
set me free
How can I forget, how You've 
brought me out
How can I forget, oh never

1184;PENDO LA MUNGU;;"Pendo la Mungu
Upendo wa mungu ni mkuu

Nayo bhari ya damu yake 
Imeua dhambi

Pendo la Mungu ni tajiri
Halipimiki lina Nguvu
Milele yote halitakwisha
Ndiyo wimbo wangu

Nyakati zote ziishapo
Na enzi zote kuisha 
Waovu wote wakomapo
Yesu adumu milele
Ufalme wake huimarishwa 
na huo upendo

Bahari na iwe wino 
Mbingu ziwe karatasi
Miti na iwe Kalamu 
Kila mtu awe mwandishi
Kuandika pendo hilo Wino 
ungekwisha
Nazo mbingu za kuandikia pia
zingekwisha"
1185;NITAKUONA PALE NG'AMBO;;"Kuna siku naingoja mateso yatapokwisha

Nitakuona pale ng'ambo
Ona pale ng'ambo
Kwenye ule mkutano hewani
Na Mbarikiwa Yesu 
Tukitawala milele, 
Kweli hiyo itakuwa siku njema

Tusipo onana tena Duniani Mpewndwa wangu
Ukidumu mwaminifu na kujitenga na uovu
Kwa ajili yetu mkutano, Umekwisha andaliwa
Divai na mikate vi tayari

Mpenzi nikweleze, hakika siku inakuja
Bwana Yesu atarudi Ahamishe Bibi Harusi 
Uko tari kwenda naye Kwenye kiwango cha saba?
Tukatawale naye pale nga'mbo"
1264;I'M GONNA SING;;"It's a song that will carry a message along
Through the deepest of foggy nights
And the tune is the rope that can throw a man hope
When he's going down for the third time
It's a sweet melody that will set your heart free
From the chains of a past defeat
You can suddenly see through the sweet harmony
A path for your wandering feet

Don't tell me the world is a hopeless old place
Then I might as well just give in
To the doom and gloom 
Life's a waiting room for the blow 
That will do us all in
I can't sympathise when before my eyes
There's a hope shining bright as day
I gotta follow the song that keeps drawing me on
With my feet dancing all the way"
1186;NI MUHUJAJI;;"Ni Muhujaji pia ni mgeni
Kwenye dunia hii yenye dhambi

Uliojengwa na Bwana wangu

CHORUS
Watakatifu Waingiapo
Watakatifu wanapoingia
Bwana naomba name niwepo
Kati ya wale wanaoingia

Nitamwona Mwokozi wangu
Nikitengana na dhambi
Lango la mbinguni litanifungukia
Mfalme wangu anipokee

Tukizunguka kwenya kiti cah enzi
Na mlango ukishafungwa
KWa sauti nitasema utukufu 
Mateso yote yamekwisha

Nijazwe Roho mwenyeji wa mji
Aamshe imani yangu
Na huu ulimwengu uniache
Niende kwa kiwango cha saba"
1187;HERE COMES THE BRIDE;;"What a celebration on that day, 
It can't be very far away; 
Heaven's Bridegroom has descended, 
The ransomed bride of God ascends; 
Heaven's bell will sweetly ring, 
Choir of angels start to sing, 
Pick up your trumpet Gabriel and blow.

CHORUS
Here comes the bride to be ever at His side, 
Oh, what a spotless bride! 
Oh, what a glorious sight! 
Here come the chosen ones, 
Here come the ransomed ones,
 Angels step aside, For here comes the bride; 
Angels step aside, 
For here comes the bride.

Some from every nation will be there, 
Wearing spotless robes So bright and fair.
All of Heaven will behold, 
The bride is marching down the streets of gold, 
Getting ready now to go, 
The very hour no one seems to know, 
Pick up your trumpet Gabriel and blow.


Bro. Branham saw them in preview

1188;HELP IS ON THE WAY;;"A woman in the Bible days,
her last meal almost gone,
But God sent Elijah,
to make his word known,
He said ""woman don't you worry, 
for God sent me today,
And before you even asked Him, 
help was on the way""

CHORUS
Just hold on a little longer, 
help is on the way,
A brighter day is coming,
for those who believe and pray, 
Help wont help tomorrow, if you give
 up today,
Just hold on a little longer, 
help is on the way.

Troubles of this life come by, 
and burdens get you down, 
You think no one is listening,
you think no one's around,
Just remember what his word says,
trust him and obey,
Keep your eyes towards the heavens, 
cause help is on the way."
1189;I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ANYMORE;;"Down here my burden's heavy
And the road is rough and long
Sometimes my feet get weary and so sore
But a brighter day is coming
Soon I'll step on Heaven's shore 
And I won't have to worry anymore

Chorus
I won't have to worry 
When I reach the other shore
All my troubles will be over 
And I'll rest forever more
My eyes will be on Jesus 
And my heart will be aglow 
And I won't have to worry anymore

Someday when life is over
And I've said my last good-byes
I'm gonna see my Savior standing at the door
Then I'll hear Him say you're welcome
All your cares are left behind
And I won't have to worry anymore"
1190;ETERNITY HAS TWO;;"When the melodys been written, 
And the words have all been picked.
And you heard the spirit calling, 
through some old sacred hynm.
In the valley of decision, 
tell me friend what will you do.
This life has many choice, Eternity has two.

This world and all its pleasures, 
will so be passed away.
The finial invitation, 
could be going out today.
You're standing at the crossroad, 
and the saviors calling you.
This life has many choice, Eternity has two.

The straight and narrow way leads to life, 
the broad way down below.
What would it profit, to gain the world, 
and lose your very soul.
Tomorrow is uncertain, 
our days on earth are few.
This life has many choice, Eternity has two."
1191;WHAT SHALL I DO WITH JESUS;;"What shall I do with Jesus?
What shall my answer be?
Question with question I answer,
What will He do with me?

Like In the days of ole Pilate,
Man of the world is today.
Jesus your Saviour is waiting,
What does your answer say?

What shall I do with Jesus?
What shall my answer be?
Question with question I answer,
What will He do with me?

Now the decision is yours friend,
Save your soul or be lost.
If you decide you will lose it,
Think of the awful cost.

What shall I do with Jesus?
What shall my answer be?
Question with question I answer,
What will He do with me?

You are the judge and the jury,
Satan's the lawyer for sin.
Christ is on trial before you,
Needing your soul to win.

What shall I do with Jesus?
What shall my answer be?
Question with question I answer,
What will He do with me?

We'll see Jesus on that day
One of these days, it won't be long

One of these days, one of these days
It won't be very long
One of these days, one of these days
When I hear that beautiful song
I'll see Him in that robe of white
Everything will be alright
One of these days, one of these days

What a day that will be
When He comes for you and me
One of these days, one of these days

1194;UKICHUKULIWA NA MASHAKA;;"Ukichukuliwa na mashaka yako
na kuona hofu kwamba utakwama,

na utashangaa kwa rehema yake.

CHORUS
Uhesabu mibaraka yote 
Mungu Aliyo yakubariki! 
Ukumbuke mambo yote piya, 
na utashangaa kwa rehema yake!

Na ukihuziwa na huzuni nyingi, 
ukiona msalaba ni mzito, 
uhesabu mibaraka kuchwa pia,
na kwa moyo wote utasifu Mungu.

Wengi watamani mali ya dunia,
utajiri wako ni Mwenyezi Mungu. 
Uhesabu mibaraka na kumbuka: 
Mali haiwezi kufungua mbingu.

Na katika mambo yote uku chini,
ukumbuke Pendo Kubwa la Mwokozi!
Na ujumlishe mibaraka yote, 
tena mwisho atakuchukua kwake!"

1196;HERE TODAY GONE TOMORROW;;"I keep watching for the 
dawning of tomorrow,
When we'll meet our blessed 
saviour in the sky,
And all the troubles of today will 
then be over,
For God will wipe all the teardrops 
from our eyes.

CHORUS
We're here today we'll be 
gone tomorrow,
And this life won't even be a 
memory 
We're here today we'll be gone 
tomorrow,
Where we'll praise the lord 
throughout eternity.

Today we're getting ready 
for that final journey,
And am making plans to live in
my new home,
Soon those eastern skies will 
bloom with clouds of glory,
At the sounding of the trumpet 
we'll be gone."
1197;SPEAK THE WORD LORD;;"If it's a foreign battlefield 
where I finally find your will 
Oh, then that is where I long to be. 
In the desert without a drink 
on some ship about to sink 
Lord, I will go if you will just speak to me. 

CHORUS
Speak the word Lord my ears 
long to hear you, 
Speak the word Lord my heart 
aches to know. 
Speak the word Lord I will be what 
you have me to be 
Speak the word Lord and your 
servant will go. 

Now there has been times that 
I complained 
as life rubbed against the grain 
and I recall those times you took 
me to my knees. 
But there is one thing I can do so 
I still give this Thanks to You 
that you lord who took my cross 
to Calvary."
1198;I AM REDEEMED;;"I was a slave in a foreign land
So very far from the Father's 
loving hand
He rescued me, one glorious day
He brought me out, paid a debt I
could not pay

CHORUS
I am redeemed, I am redeemed
Jesus loosed the chains of sin and set 
me free
I am redeemed, I am redeemed
Jesus loosed the chains of sin and set 
me free

Still I live, in a foreign land
But now I'm free according to 
redemption's plan
Soon I'll join the robed in white,
the redeemed
We'll sing a song, holy angels, 
they cannot sing

Some glorious morning they will come all
nations from every generation
Side by side they will march into the celestial 
city of Jehova and in perfect harmony they will 
begin humming a brand new song
A song composed by God Himself, 
arranged for His children
And as the saved by Grace approach their 

Land of dreams, 
the host of Heaven will step aside,
even the angels will be silent
For they cannot sing this new song
For this song is reserved for voices that 
once cried out for a Redeemer 
Those washed in the blood of the Lamb

I am redeemed, by love divine
Glory, glory Christ is mine, 
He's mine All to him, I now resign
Jesus loosed the chains of sin
and set me free
My Jesus loosed the chains of sin and
set me free"
1199;HERE WE ARE;;"Here we are in your presence
Lifting holy hands to You
Here we are praising Jesus
For the things He's brought 
us through.

I don't have the words to tell You 
how I feel, 
I just don't know what I can say
I'm not worthy to speak Your 
Holy Name, 
Yet You tell me You love me 
just the same.

Here we are in Your presence
Lifting holy hands to You
Here we are praising Jesus
For the things He's brought 
us through.

I never thought that it could 
be this way, 
And I never thought I'd be the one, 
But You found me dying in my sin.
And You looked at me with love that 
took me in.

Here we are in Your presence
Lifting holy hands to You
Here we are praising Jesus
For the things He's brought 
us through
For the things He's brought

1200;HOLD ON TO JESUS;;"CHORUS
I'm gonna hold on, hold on to Jesus, 
hold to the Lamb of Calvary
I'm gonna hold on, hold on 
Jesus and Jesus will hold on to me

In this troubled world we live in;
nothin' seems to make sense
Many looking' for the way, searching 
to and fro
Sometimes this rope I'm holdin'
seems to be slippin'
but I'm gonna hold on tighter to the 
only hope I know

Oh' Satan keeps on talkin'
saying' you can't make it
Tryin' to convince me there's no use to try
But I refuse to listen and keep right on goin'
Trustin' and believing' in the Jesus 
knots of time"
1201;WHEN GOD DIPS HIS PEN OF LOVE;;"When God dips His pen of love in my heart
And writes my soul the message He wants me
to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine
When God dips His love in my heart

I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation when He made 
me whole
But I found I couldn't hide
Such love as Jesus did impart

It makes me laugh and it makes me cry
Sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips His love in my heart

He walked every step up Calvary's ragged way
And He gave His life completely to bring a 
better day
My life was lost in sinned but in love He took me in
His blood washed all my sins away

I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation when He made 
me whole
But I found I couldn't hide
Such love as Jesus did impart

It makes me laugh and it makes me cry
Sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips His love in my heart"

Take my hand now, lead me closer 
Lord I need to meet you there

In these waters, healing
mercy flows 
with freedom from despair
I am going, to that river
Lord I need to meet you there

Come and join us, in the river 
Come find life beyond compare
He is calling, He is waiting Jesus 
longs to meet you there
He is calling, He is waiting Jesus

1203;A MOMENT OF GRACE;;"She was down on her knees
She would never get free
Her accusers had stones in their hands
And they turned to Jesus just to see 
what He'd say
But the Lord just wrote in the sand

They all walked away
But they heard Him say,
""Let the sin-free cast the first stone""
And with tears on her face
All her sins were erased
She stood in a moment of grace

Now the thief on the cross
Knew that his life was lost
He must pay for the crimes of his past
He had done nothing right
And he would sure lose this fight
His time was running out fast

In desperation he cried
To the Lord at his side
""Remember me when you reach 
Heaven's gate""
And Jesus forgave
And all his sin was erased
And he died in a moment of grace

A moment of grace
Undeserved favor
Unspeakable joy
My soul found an anchor
Unmerited love and
Mercy that swept my soul away
He called my name
And everything changed in a 
moment of grace

See, I've been counted out
By the self-righteous crowd
Who would say that I'm not worthy to live
They say, ""You've drifted too far, you're 
so stuck in sin's mire,
You need a miracle that only God can give""

Then Jesus passed by
And with this reply,
He said, ""I choose you - just live for 
me today""
And Jesus forgave
And all my sin was erased
And I stood in my moment of grace

A moment of grace
Undeserved favor
Unspeakable joy
My soul found an anchor
It was unmerited love and
And mercy that swept my soul away
He called my name
And everything changed in a 
moment of grace"
1204;MERCY WAS MADE;;"As Jesus sat down one day to eat
A woman came and bowed at His feet
With tear filled eyes she seemed so all alone
No peace in her heart and no joy within
A sinner was all she'd ever been
But mercy was found
When she was born again

CHORUS
Mercy was found when she knelt down
And amazing grace was all around
And all at once her brand new life began
All the wrong from all her past
Was all forgiven gone at last
And mercy was found
When she was born again.

Like the woman who came to Jesus there
My sins were many, my load hard to bear
It seemed there was no hope within
Then all alone in my dark despair
Jesus came, and He met me there
And mercy was found
And I was born again."
1205;KNOWING YOU JESUS;;"All I once held dear, built my life upon
All this world reveres, and wars to own
All I once thought gain I have counted loss
Spent and worthless now, compared to this

CHORUS
Knowing you, Jesus
Knowing you, there is no greater thing
You're my all, you're the best
You're my joy, my righteousness
And I love you, Lord

Now my heart's desire is to know you more
To be found in you and known as yours
To possess by faith what I could not earn
All-surpassing gift of righteousness

Oh, to know the power of your risen life
And to know You in Your sufferings
To become like you in your death, my Lord
So with you to live and never die"
1206;POTTER'S HAND;;"Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior
I know for sure all of my days are held 
in Your hand
And crafted into Your perfect plan

You gently called me into Your presence
Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit
Teach me dear Lord, to live all of my life
Through Your eyes

And I'm captured by Your Holy calling
Set me apart, I know You're drawing 
me to Yourself
Lead me Lord, I pray

Take me and mold me, use me, fill me
I give my life to the Potter's hand
Call me, You guide me, lead me, walk beside me
I give my life to the Potter's hand

1207;THERE IS A RIVER;;"CHORUS
There is a river and it flows from 
deep within 
There is a fountain that frees the soul 
from sin 
Come to this water 
There is a vast supply 
There is a river that never shall run dry 

There was a thirsty woman 
She was drawing from the well 
See, her life was ruined and wasted 
And her soul was bound for hell 
Oh, but then she met the Master and He 
told her of her sin 
And He said, ""If you drink this water, 
you'll never thirst again"" 

There came a sound from Heaven
As a rushing, mighty wind,
It filled their hearts with singing,
And gave them peace within.
The prophet gave the promise,
The Spirit will descend,
And from your inner being,
A river with no end

Lose all your guilty stains 
Lose all your guilty stains 
Oh, come to this water 
There is a vast supply 
There is a river that never shall 
run dry 
There is a river that never shall 
run dry"
1208;RIGHT ON TIME;;"They sent for Jesus, 
""Your friend's about to die.""
But tarried He still far behind,
So they laid Lazarus in a tomb, 
And they said their last good-byes, 
then coming down the road 
was Jesus, right on time!

CHORUS
Just hold on, my child because, 
He's not too far away, 
and He knows your needs before 
you pray, 
So when your feet are weary,
From the mountains you have climbed, 
Look ahead here comes Jesus, 
right on time! 

I've struggled through life's deserts,
They were so hot and dry, 
Till it seemed all hope was gone, 
and I would die, 
And I wondered ""Where was He? 
Is He still a Friend of mine
then coming down the road
was Jesus right on time!"
1209;BY HIS LOVE;;"CHORUS
By His love I'm lifted from the 
lowest valley
By His Grace, blest in every way
By His blood I'm saved and forgiven
By His strength I can make it 
another day

Life can be so full of 
disappointments, 
things get out of hand just 
won't go our way
But there's one who longs to carry 
all our burdens
And if we let Him He can take 
our cares away.

I don't put my trust in finding 
easy answers
like the kind of folks who fall for 
everything
I found all the answers that I 
need in Jesus
And the joy that only serving him 
can bring."

1211;WOUNDED DOVE;;"From the outer regions of the lost
God has brought us back
Her gates are the gates of hell
And many enter therein
Then at last we heard a great blast
The Thunders uttering
This time they spoke clearly
The mystery of the Seventh Seal
And here we are in the second-fold
of a three-fold mystery
Part being spoken by the Son of
man
But the other in you and me

CHORUS
The message of a wounded
dove went home
Now it’s come back again
In the power of the Word
Speaking resurrection
Speaking rapturing faith
Full redemption
From a fallen state

With the power that will judge the
earth
We are lifted higher
Higher and higher until we all
come into that Seventh peak
And from there we’ll change
dimensions
Cross into that other land
Where we’ll meet friends and
loved ones
And those who’ve already gone

A window now is opened
And the light is shining through
Celestial light from a celestial world
Shining into our souls
The dove and the raven are loosed
Two powers in the earth
One feeding on the flesh of
disobedient men
But the dove in you and me
And for this purpose He's
descended
A full cycle of time's about ended
And here we are in this reality
While Noah was a coded mystery"
1212;Amazing Grace;;"It's a song holy angels cannot sing
Amazing grace how sweet that sound
It's a song holy angels cannot sing
I once was lost but now i'm found"
1213;We are able;;"We are able to go up and take the country
To possess the land from Jordan to the sea
Though the giants may be on our way to hinder 
God Will surely gives us victory

(Move on to the righteous side
Move on to the righteous side 
Move on to the righteous side with God) x2"
1214;COME EXPECTING, COME BELIEVING;;"Chorus
Come expecting (Jesus)
Come anticipating (Jesus) 
You will receive (You will receive)
What you came for (what you came for) 
Come realizing (realize) 
That His Word is a discerner (He discerns)
Come believing you will hear from the Lord

King David said I was glad when they  
mentioned His house, 
One thing have I desired and I will see
To behold His beauty and quiet and His temple 
to dwell in His house forevermore

King Hezekiah perplexed about the letter 
he received 
He spread it in the house of the Lord 
Hannah in her distress came and prayed 
earnestly 
Even you your answer you will hear

Where two or three are gathered in his name
The omnipresent will be in their midst 
And in the preaching of the word 
Our faith is renewed, the answers to life's 
queries become clear."
1215;THE ONLY REAL PEACE;;"Life is a few days of trouble 
a wise man once said
But I'll not complain for I'm sheltered, 
I'm clothed, and I'm fed
But many's the trials, my wants, and 
my needs put me through
'Cause when I'm reminded 
of sweet peace I have Lord in You

Chorus
The only real peace that I have 
dear Lord is in You
The only real peace that I have 
dear Lord is in You
With all life's frustrations 
I need you and I know I do
'Cause the only real peace
 that I have dear Lord is in You


The higher I soar in my dreams 
the harder I fall
And sometimes I wonder 
if dreams are worth dreaming at all
But my disappointments 
can't keep me blinded and blue
'Cause when I'm reminded 
of sweet peace I have Lord in You
'Cause the only real peace that I have 
dear Lord is in You"
1216;HEALING RAIN;;"Healing rain is coming down
It's coming nearer to this old town
Rich and poor, weak and strong
It's bringing mercy, it won't be long

Healing rain is coming down
It's coming closer to the lost and found
Tears of joy, and tears of shame
Are washed forever in Jesus' name

Healing rain, it comes with fire
So let it fall and take us higher
Healing rain, I'm not afraid
To be washed in Heaven's rain

Lift your heads, let us return
To the mercy seat where time began
And in your eyes, I see the pain
Come soak this dry heart with healing rain

And only You, the Son of man
Can take a leper and let him stand
So lift your hands, they can be held
By someone greater, the great I Am

Healing rain, it comes with fire
So let it fall and take us higher
Healing rain, I'm not afraid
To be washed in Heaven's rain

To be washed in Heaven's rain...

Healing rain is falling down
Healing rain is falling down
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid..."
1217;BECAUSE OF CALVARY;;"I lived a wasted life that had no meaning
I found no peace in anything that I tried
Then I saw my life quickly fade
a brand new one began 
The day I found the cross where
 Jesus died

CHORUS
And because of calvary
I'll never be the same again
I found the joy I never thought could
 ever be
He took a life shattered by sin 
Put it together once again 
And oh what a change theres been 
Because of calvary

And when my heart is weak and growing
 weary
I journey in my mind back to calvary
And I bow beneath the stream
That washes white as snow
And I find His grace is waiting there for me"
1218;I KNOW I KNOW;;"Some people say that this old time religion
It's just a thing of the past
But in this modern day that we're livin'
It's the only thing that will last
Now you may think that I'm a little old fashioned
Well friend, that's alright with me
But I am so glad that I am a Christian
And from sin I have been set free

CHORUS
I know, I know, there's no doubt about it
He lives in my heart and I'm gonna shout it
I know, I know my sins are forgiven
And I'm on my way to a place that's called Heaven

Not long ago, at an old fashioned meetin'
I knelt on my knees there in prayer
He lifted my burdens, sin shackles fell from me
And His presence was so real everywhere
Now that this load that I carry is lighter
And He changed my gray skies to blue
My steps are now higher for I have this assurance
That His sweet love will carry me through

Come go with me to that land over yonder
He's prepared for the pure and the true
It's a place where sickness and death cannot enter
I'm going, brother, how about you?
Now maybe today or maybe tomorrow
He'll return in robes of pure white
I'm packing up now, getting my things together
Who knows? It might be tonight"
1220;JUST SAY THE RIGHT WORD;;"Many years ago a woman named Mary
Received a visit from an angel of the Lord
She said be it unto me according to your word
She said the right thing and the promise was given to her

CHORUS
Just say the right word and what you ask will be given
Just approach him with the right attitude
Hattie Wright said ""thats the truth brother Branham""
She said the right word her sons received eternal life

Around 900 denominations claim theyre his bride
They all claim that hes coming back for them
But the showdown is going to tell who belongs to him
She'll say the right word, 
The rapture will take her away from here"
1221;PRESS ON;;"Press on it won't be  very long
Until we reach that land of song
In heaven some sweet day 
l'm going home to stay
Press on it won't be  very long"
1222;ALTAR OF GRACE;;"Grace isn't through when it rescues
the sinner
It doesn't end with Salvation's song
For the rest of our days Grace is a river
That flows through our lives
And carries us home

CHORUS 
Grace
There is no greater reason than grace
For worship and praise
Grace
All the glory to Jesus
I bow at the altar of Grace
I bow at the altar of Grace

Grace is our hope when we're all out 
of options
The answer that comes to a desperate prayer
Grace is the arms that lift up the fallen
And comfort for wounds that are too grate 
to bare

Grace isn't wearied from facing the battle
It doesn't retreat when the outlook is grin
When we cower in shame
Grace is a soldier that fights to remind us 
God's love never ends

Grace is a whisper that's louder than thunder
A promise of peace through the storms 
that rage
And one day Grace will be Heaven's perfection
Forever and ever we'll sing of His Grace"
1223;EMPTY ME LORD;;"Lord I know when You saved me, You 
filled me 
with Your Spirit and I praise your holy name 
but oh precious Lords to be a light that 
others see 
Your Holy Spirit must be shining on me 

CHORUS
Lord will you empty me of every 
selfish thing
that would hinder my sweet walk with thee 
Now shine down upon me and fill 
me anew 
In every way Lord let me be more 
like You 

Now when Your Light Lord is shining
upon me 
there's no hiding Its wonderful glow 
Family and children, my neighbors and all 
my friends 
when I'm in Jesus then all others will know 

Lord will you empty me of every selfish thing 
that would hinder my sweet walk with thee 
Now shine down upon me and fill me anew 
In every way Lord let me be more like You 
.....Shine down upon me and fill me anew 
In every way Lord let me be more like You"
1224;I'LL TAKE YOU HOME;;"I'm Standing on the shore,
Looking out across life's ocean,
and I see the storm of fury round me roll,
and I just can't see no way,
That I'm gonna make it over, despair 
and fear are troubling my soul. 

CHORUS
Then I see a ship sailing safely in 
the Harbor, 
and I'm so thankful it's arriving just in time,
The Captain's calling, 
 ""come aboard my little children,
 I'll take you home on the old ship of Zion."" 

These waves are getting closer,
They're about to pull me under,
And desperately I'm trying to hold on; 
Every where I look there's darkness all 
around me,
Oh Lord how long before the morning 
dawns."
1225;MERCY AND LOVE;;"CHORUS
Yes, I'm saved by mercy and love
Cleansed by the power of 
precious Blood
Sweet salvation from up above
Saved by mercy and love
Saved by mercy and love

Sheltered in His arms of grace
Safe from the depths of a fiery grave
Free from the wages of my sin
It feels so good to be born again

I've got a peace I've never known
Blessed by the favor that I've been
shown
Bought by Calvary's perfect Lamb
A child of the King how rich I am

There's a home in heaven waiting 
for me
And I'm gonna live for eternity"
1226;AM SO THANKFUL;;"Once my life didn't have no meaning
I was alone drifting in the night
At an altar I cried "" Jesus, please help me""
Then He reached down His hand and
took a hold of mine.

CHORUS
And am so thankful that a way was made 
at Calvary,
So I could have a right to eternal life,
Now am not alone since Jesus signed my
pardon,
Am so happy now He's walking by my side.

I have peace of mind since burdens I don't 
carry,
In the trials I have the victory,
I won't stand alone anymore in life's battles,
I just call on his name am covered by 
His blood"
1227;HE TOOK NOTHING AND MADE SOMETHING;;"When there were no birds to fly 
And the rivers all were dry 
God took nothing and made something 
for me 
When there were no flowers to bloom 
And there was no sun or moon 
God took nothing and made something 
of me 

When the earth was null and void 
And there was no light to see 
And the land was not parted from the sea 
He knew back then, I'd need a friend 
A friend who loved me to the end 
He took nothing and made something 
of me 

When my sins were not forgiven 
And down on my knees were driven 
God took nothing and made something
 of me 
He forgave me all my sins 
Brought sweet joy and peace within 
God took nothing and made something 
of me"
1228;THE LONG ARM OF LOVE;;"Out in the Badlands, a heart on the run, 
Haunted and guilty from the things that 
you've done; 
You were wanted by justice dead or alive, 
Then you're cleared of the charges by the 
blood of Christ. 

CHORUS
You can't outrun the long arm of love, 
God's mercy rides on when justice gives up; 
Wherever you are you can't go far enough, 
Whatever you've done you can't outrun the
long arm of love. 

Longing for shelter, thirsty and dry, 
A life ruined and wasted and it was 
sentenced to die; 
Oh it's useless to keep up this maddening 
pace; 
Raise your hands and surrender to 
amazing grace."

1231;I SAW THE MAN;;"I often wonder who could be so cruel
To hang my Lord upon a rugged tree
But then I chance to pass
An old looking glass
And there I saw the man staring back at me

I saw the eyes that turned aside
I saw the lips that sadly whispered ""Crucify!""
I saw the feet that walked in sin
I saw the hand that drove the nails in Him
I saw the man that crucified the Lord

If you should ever wonder
About the sacrifice He made
About the pain and the suffering
He went through
Well if you should chance to pass
Some old looking glass
Won't that be some reflection of you?

You'll see the eyes that turned aside
You'll see the lips that sadly whispered ""Crucify!""
You'll see your feet that walked in sin
You'll see your hand that drove the nails in Him
You'll see the man that crucified the Lord"
1232;AMAZING LOVE, HOW CAN IT BE?;;"I'm forgiven because You were forsaken
I'm accepted, You were condemned
I am alive and well, Your spirit is within me
'Cause You died and rose again

I'm forgiven because You were forsaken
I'm accepted, You were condemned
I am alive and well, Your spirit is within me
'Cause You died and rose again

Amazing love, how can it be?
That You, my King would die for me?
Amazing love, I know its true
It's my joy to honor You
In all I do, I honor You"
1235;THROUGH THE FIRE;;"So many times ive questioned 
certain circumstances
Things i could not understand
Many times in trials, weakness blurs my vision
Then my frustration gets so out of hand

But its then i am reminded 
I've never been forsaken
Ive never had to stand the test alone, no
But when i look at all the victories 
The spirit rising up in me
And its through the fire my weakness 
is made strong

CHORUS
He never promised that the cross 
would not get heavy
and the hill would not be hard to climb
He never offered victories without fighting but
he said help would always come in time
Just remember where you're standing 
in the valley of decision
And the advesary says give in
Just hold on, our Lord will show up
And He will take you through the fire again

BRIDGE
I know within myself that i would surely perish
but  if i trust the Hand of God
 He'll shield the flame again and again"
1236;BY FAITH;;"By faith we see the hand of God 
In the light of creation's grand design 
In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness 
Who walk by faith and not by sight 

By faith our fathers roamed the earth 
With the power of His promise in their hearts 
Of a holy city built by God's own hand 
A place where peace and justice reign 

CHORUS
We will stand as children of the promise 
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward 
Till the race is finished and the work is done 
We'll walk by faith and not by sight 

By faith the prophets saw a day 
When the longed-for Messiah would appear 
With the power to break the chains of sin and death 
And rise triumphant from the grave 

By faith the church was called to go 
In the power of the Spirit to the lost 
To deliver captives and to preach good news 
In every corner of the earth 

By faith this mountain shall be moved 
And the power of the gospel shall prevail 
For we know in Christ all things are possible 
For all who call upon His name"

And I know what to leave......

But I can't survive with them, 
I fly and look, 
I land and catch with power, 
The power of the word, 
That is given unto us, 
To possess the victory, 

Now the prophet of this day, 
With the angel of the Lord, 
Has made me to see, 
Who I am, 
Third angel, predestinated, 
To manifest the book of acts,"

1239;THE HOLYGHOST WILL SET YOUR FEET TO DANCING;;"Now, David danced before the Lord
to magnify His name,
In God's Almighty Presence
He felt no sense of shame.
Well, the oil of gladness
flowed that day,
It quickened every heart;
And God gave Brother David,
a dance down in his heart.

CHORUS
The Holy Ghost will set your 
feet to dancing
The Holy Ghost  will thrill you 
through and through
The Holy Ghost will set your 
feet to dancing
And set your heart to dancing too

Out of Egypt long ago
the Israelites fled,
By a mighty miracle
they were all kept and fed;
Through the Red Sea they were brought,
the water stood apart;
And God gave Sister Mirriam,
a dance down in her heart.

There was a celebration
upon the Red Sea shore,
Timbrels rang, the desert sand,
it became a dancing floor;
The people sang, they praised God there,
He made the gloom depart,
And He put a dance of loving joy,
deep down in their hearts.

The prodigal was far away,
wand'ring out in sin,
He came back to father's house,
father took him in.
He put a robe upon his son,
the merriment did start;
The prodigal got dancing feet
to match his dancing heart.

Oh the father's house with music rang
to welcome home the son,
The wine was flowing full and free,
all misery was done.
But the elder brother looking on
complained this isn't fair;
You see, he had not got a dancing heart
like all the others there.

Many saints are called and bound
by unbelief today,
They say they want
the blessings of the Lord,
but worry what men may say;
Just let the Lord have full control,
dead traditions part,
My God will set you free within,
You'll have that dancing heart."

1245;WASN'T THAT LOVE;;"In a town of Bethlehem
God came down to visit a man
Wasn't that Love×2
He knew pain and loneliness
 As He bore the price of flesh.

Chorus
Wasn't that love
How He left His home above,
To die on calvary
Just to save a wretch like me.
Everyday am still amazed,
There's only one thing left to say
Wasn't that love×2

As He stood in Pilate's front,
He never said a word at all
Wasn't that love×2
He was nailed and crucified 
But He knew He came to die
Wasn't that love×2

As He laid there in the tomb,
 He teaches what He came to do
Wasn't that love×2
But He rose up from the grave,
So I can rise today,
Wasn't that love×2."
1246;JUST A LITTLE TO STAY HERE;;"Soon this life will all be over, 
And our pilgrimage will end.
Soon we'll take our heav'nly journey,
Be at home again with friends
Heaven's gates are standing open
Waiting for our entrance there
Some sweet day we're going over
All the beauties there to share.

Just a Little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait
Just a little while to labor
In the path that's always straight
Just a little more of trouble
In this low and sinful state
Then we'll enter Heaven's portals,
Sweeping thru the pearly gates.

Soon we'll see the light of morning
Then the new day will begin
Soon we'll hear the Father calling,
""Come my children, enter in.""
Then we'll hear a choir of angels
Singing out the vict'ry song,
All our troubles will be ended
And we'll live with heaven's throng

Just a Little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait
Just a little while to labor
In the path that's always straight
Just a little more of trouble
In this low and sinful state
Then we'll enter Heaven's portals,
Sweeping thru the pearly gates.

Soon we'll meet again our loved ones
And we'll take them by the hand,
Soon we'll press them to our bosom
Over in the promised land;
Then we'll be at home forever,
Thru-out all eternity,
What a blessed, blessed morning
That eternal morn shall be.

Just a Little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait
Just a little while to labor
In the path that's always straight
Just a little more of trouble

Sweeping thru the pearly gates."
1247;GOD'S PROPHETS MAKE NO MISTAKE;;"Brother Branham  preached the message the future home,
And afterwards he spoke to billy Paul,
He said""Billy ,did you understand?"", he said ""Yes I think I did""
Then he turned and told him ""No you didn't son,
But he said remember is not important to understand 
But is mighty Important to believe,
From 47 to 65 ,we believe it is all his word,
And that word will take the bride into the sky.
     
                        CHORUS
   If God taught it ,Brother brother Branham spoke it
   We believe it, and that Settles it,
   God's   prophets make no mistake,God's word can not fail,
   So my friend lets say what's on the tape.  

Many people criticize the voice of God,
They can't understand the call of God
But if brother Branham say "" be - be - be""
That's THUS SAITH THE LORD to me,
That word will stand to work eternity 

We don't need no one to tell us what he ment  
Or someone to interpret what he said
For the word of God is truth
And it is so absolute 
Brother Branham said "" Am God's voice to you""."
1248;CHAIN BREAKER;;"If you've been walking the same 
old road for miles and miles
If you've been hearing the same 
old voice tell the same old lies
If you're trying to feel the same 
old holes inside
There's a better life
There's a better life

If you've got pain
He's a pain taker
If you feel lost
He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving
He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you've got chains
He's a chain breaker

We've all search for the light of 
day in the dead of night
We've all found ourselves worn 
out from the same old fight
We've all run to things we know 
just ain't right
And there's a better life
There's a better life

If you've got pain
He's a pain taker
If you feel lost
He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving
He's a prison-shaking Savior
If you've got chains
He's a chain breaker"
1249;I'M LOOKING AHEAD;;"CHORUS 
I'm looking ahead,
To that glorious city 
Where I'll shake the hands,
Of those who've gone before me 
I can still feel,
The same tender hand that's carrying me 
Will lead me home,
So Lord I'm looking ahead. 

Living in a world of insanity 
We're surrounded by the dead,
They are all asleep, 
But under the Easter seal thank God,
We're quickened and awakened 
Now the master is here the son has risen 
He's no longer the hidden Messiah,
But he has appeared,
Now to the promise of a second coming,
 I'm looking ahead

So many among us are hurting 
They're wounded in the battle  
Lord they are dying 
Brothers take each others hand  
Sisters do the same thing too 
Lift each other in prayer,
We will make it through 
And though skin worms may destroy this body 
I've got another one waiting for me 
So Lord fill my soul with your Holy Ghost 
Cleanse me and make me whole"
1250;HE DIED FOR YOU;;"Broken, mocked and scorned 
Was a man hanging from a cross 
With a crown of thorns  
Who is He, this man, who died for me 
This given son who was born to die 
So we could be redeemed  

CHORUS 
He died for you, He died for me 
He took my pain and He bore  
my shame 
That day on Calvary 
The bleeding one, God's only Son 
What kind of man is this would walk  
this road alone Jesus 

It was supposed to me 
Hanging from that tree 
It was my sin that crucified Him  
I don't deserve any mercy 
But as we come to you today 
We remember what you gave 
Lord through this bleeding, word You have 
unveiled to us our names  


I didn't see but I I believe 
Yes I believe"
1251;WATCH THE LAMB;;"Walking on the road to Jerusalem, 
The time had come to sacrifice again, 
My two small sons,
They walked beside me on the road,
The reason that they came was to watch the lamb.

""Daddy, daddy, What will see there,
There's so much that we don't understand"",
So I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".

""There will be so many in Jerusalem today,
We must be sure the lamb doesn't run away"",
And I told them of Moses and Father Abraham,
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"".

When we reached the city,
I knew something must be wrong, 
There were no joyful worshipers, 
No joyful worship songs,
I stood there with my children 
in the midst of angry men, 
Then I heard the crowd cry out
""Crucify Him"".

We tried to leave the city but 
we could not get away, 
Forced to play in this drama
a part I did not wish to play,
""Why upon this day were men 
condemned to die?, 
Why were we standing here, 
Where soon they would pass by?"".

I looked and said, ""even now they come"",
The first one cried for mercy, 
The people gave him none, 
The second one was violent, 
He was arrogant and loud, 
I still can hear his angry voice 
screaming at the crowd,

Then someone said ""there's Jesus"", 
I could scarce believe my eyes, 
A man so badly beaten,
He barely looked alive, 
Blood poured from His body, 
From the thorns upon His brow, 
Running down the cross, 
Falling to the ground.
I watched Him as He struggled, 
I watched Him as He fell, 
The cross came down upon His back,
The crowd began to yell, 

In that moment I felt such agony, 
In that moment I felt such loss,
Till a Roman soldier grabbed my arm
and screamed, ""you, carry His cross"".
At first I tried to resist him,
Then his hand reached for his sword,
So I knelt and took the cross from the Lord,
I placed it on my shoulder,
And started down the street,
The blood that he'd been shedding
was running down my cheek.

They led us to Golgotha, 
They drove nails deep in His feet and hands,
Yet upon the cross I heard Him pray
""Father, forgive them"".
Oh, never have I seen such love in any other eyes,
""Into thy hands I commit my spirit"" 
He prayed and then He died,

I stood for what seemed like years,
I'd lost all sense of time until 
I felt two tiny hands holding tight to mine,
My children stood there weeping,
I heard the oldest say,
""Father please forgive us, the lamb ran away"".
""Daddy, daddy, What have we seen here?,
There's so much that we don't understand"",
So I took them in my arms,
And we turned and faced the cross,
Then I said ""dear children watch the lamb"""
1252;MIRACLE IN THE MAKING;;"The crowd was great but she knew 
she had to reach Him.
For it was her last hope of ever being healed.
So she pressed through until she 
touched his garment
Oh, and right then and there, her miracle 
was fulfilled.

CHORUS
There's a miracle in the making
One for you the Father is working even now.
Your prayers have been heard and 
the answer is on the way
There's a miracle in the making for you today

Have you prayed and prayed and still 
you find no answer.
Has your faith grown weak and you feel 
you're all alone?
Don't give up for the God you serve 
won't leave you.
There's a miracle for you, just keep 
holding on."
1253;LIGHTHOUSE;;"There’s a lighthouse on the
hillside,
That overlooks life’s sea;
When I’m tossed it sends out a
light,
That I might see;
And the light that shines in
darkness now,
Will safely lead me o’er;
If it was not for that lighthouse
My ship would sail no more.

CHORUS
I thank God for the Lighthouse,
I owe my life to Him;
For Jesus is the Lighthouse,
And from the rocks of sin
He has shone His Light around
me,
That I might clearly see;
If it was not for that Lighthouse
Tell me where would this ship be

Everybody that lives around us,
Says ''tear that old lighthouse
down'',
''The big ships don’t sail this way
anymore,
There’s no use of it standing round,''
But then my mind goes back to
that stormy night,
When just in time, I saw the Light,
Yes, the Light from that old
Lighthouse
That stands up there on the hill"
1254;WHEN I LAY MY ISAAC DOWN;;"Abraham prayed for the day 
God would give him a son 
Blessed Isaac was his name 
The greatest gift he'd ever known 
Then came the day, who would 
have dreamed 
God would say ""Give him to me
On this mountain you will prove, 
It's you and Isaac, or it's me and you""

CHORUS
When I lay my Isaac down 
With a broken heart but my Father's 
proud 
On this altar where he lays
Just to find it wasn't him 
 God wanted me

Most of us I'd dare to say 
Have an Isaac in God's way 
On the Altar God will prove 
It's not your Isaac that he 
 wants 
He wants you

All to Jesus I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.

I surrender all,
I surrender all,
All to Thee, my blessed 
Saviour
I surrender all."

1. King David said I was glad when
they mentioned His house, 
One thing have I desired and I will see
To behold His beauty and quiet and His temple 
to dwell in His house forevermore

2. King Hezekiah perplexed

He spread it in the house of the Lord 
Hannah in her distress came and prayed earnestly 
Even you your answer you will hear

3. Where two or three are

Our faith is renewed, the answers to

All my cares and burdens

1258;EVERPRESENT WATER FROM THE ROCK;;"I was searching through a barren land 
trying to find a drink
Oh, it was so hot and dry
I thought that I would faint
Sometimes I think I'd find a place
It'd turn out to be a mirage
Then I heard that spoken word
Found that water from the Rock

Everpresent water from the Rock
Drink you'll never thirst again
Jesus said you come to Him
Drink this water that he's got
In you would be a living well
Springing up to everlasting life
We all know that Christ is
Everpresent water from the Rock

Since I drank from this spiritual Rock
My feet's not touched the ground
Now I'm going everywhere
Singing about what I've found
I'm standing underneath the spout
Where the glory of the lord comes out
If you're tired of your polluted stream,
Come and get a drink

Of this water from the Rock
Drink you'll never thirst again
Jesus said you come to him
Drink this water that he's got
In you would be a living well
Springing up to everlasting life
We all know that Christ is
Everpresent water from the Rock"

All those years longing for a land.
We would start, much too weak to stand, 
and they took their toll.
O Lord you brought us from a mighty long way,

Tyrants of their soul.
With no place we could call our own.
With no song, Lord You heard our groan.
And You made a way, where there was no way.

O Lord you brought us from a mighty long way, 
a mighty long stay in the wilderness.
O Lord You brought us through the thick and thin,

Out of chains and the bonds of man.
Out of death, and the curse of sin, 
through the desert sand, 
to the promise land.

O Lord you brought us from a mighty long way, 
a mighty long stay in the wilderness.

1262;THE ANCHOR HOLDS;;"I have journeyed through the long dark night
Out on the open sea, by faith alone
Sight unknown; and yet

The anchor holds
Though the ship is battered

Though the sails are torn
I have fallen on my knees as
 I face the raging seas
The anchor holds in spite of the storm

I've had visions, I've had dreams
I've even held them in my hand
But I never knew they would slip right through
Like they were only grains of sand

The anchor holds
Though the ship is battered
The anchor holds
Though the sails are torn
I have fallen on my knees as 
I face the raging seas
The anchor holds in spite of the storm

I have been young but I'm older now
And there has been beauty these eyes have seen
But it was in the night, through the storms of my life
Oh, that's where God proved His love for me

The anchor holds
Though the ship's been battered
The anchor holds
Though the sails are torn
I have fallen on my knees as

1269;HE'S ALIVE;;"The gates and doors were barred and all the 
windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at
 every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through 
to drag us all away.

Then just before the sunrise I heard something 
at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down 
to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the 
sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary 
so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us 
were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and 
none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now 
his body isn't there.

We both ran toward the garden then John 
ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just 
the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in 
was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was 
more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but 
what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift 
me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and 
then I'd watched him die,

Back inside the house again all the guilt 
and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to 
my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied 
I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange 
and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove 
shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms 
held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung 
to him and cried,

He raised me to my feet and as 
I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight 
from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in 
sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted
 into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive 
and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive"

Safe from heartache pain and care
We shall all that glory share
(And I'm gonna)
Sit down beside my Jesus
Sit down and rest a while

CHORUS
We'll soon be done 
With troubles and trials in that home 
on the other side
(And I'm gonna)
Shake glad hands with the elders
Tell my kindred good morning
(then I'm gonna)
Sit beside my Jesus
Gonna sit down and rest while

Kindred and friends now wait for me
Soon their faces I shall see
We'll soon be done
With troubles and trials 
Tis a home of life so fair
And we'll be gathered there
(And I'm gonna)
Sit down beside my Jesus
Sit down and rest a while

I shall behold His blessed face
I shall feel His matchless grace
We'll soon be done 
With troubles and trials
Oh what peace and joy sublime
In that home of love divine
(And I'm gonna)
Sit down beside my Jesus
Sit down rest for a while"
1271;STEPPING IN THE LIGHT;;"Trying to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Trying to follow our Savior and King;
Shaping our lives by His blessed example,
Happy, how happy, the songs that we bring.

CHORUS 
How beautiful to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Stepping in the light, stepping in the light,
How beautiful to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Led in paths of light.

Pressing more closely to Him Who is leading,
When we are tempted to turn from the way;
Trusting the arm that is strong to defend us,
Happy, how happy, our praises each day.

Walking in footsteps of gentle forbearance,
Footsteps of faithfulness, mercy, and love,
Looking to Him for the grace freely promised,
Happy, how happy, our journey above.

Trying to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Upward, still upward, we follow our Guide;
When we shall see Him, ""the King in His beauty,""
Happy, how happy, our place at His side."
1272;THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR;;"Once my heart and soul were
fettered
By the binding chains of sin,
But the Great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Blessed be His holy name!
He's the Great Emancipator,
That's the song of the redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting,
O, so helpless and alone,
But the seeking Shepherd found
me,
Led me to my Father's home."
1273;SHELTERED IN THE ARMS F;;"I feel the touch of hands so warm
and tender,
They’re leading me
Through paths that I must trod;
I’ll have no fear for Jesus walks
beside me,
For I’m sheltered in the arms of God.

CHORUS
So let the storm rage high and
dark clouds rise,
They won’t worry me;
For, I’m sheltered safe within the
arms of God.
He walks with me and naught on
earth can harm me
For I’m sheltered in the arms of God.

Soon I shall hear the call from
Heaven’s portals,
""Come home my child, it’s the last
step you have trod,""
I will be changed and taken to
God’s New Heaven,
For I’m sheltered in the arms of God."
1274;HE IS ABLE;;"He is able, more than able,
To accomplish what concerns me
today.
He is able, more than able
To handle anything that comes my
way.
He is able, more than able
To do much more than I could ever
dream,
He is able, more than able
To make me what He wants me to
be"
1275;ON THE BANKS OF THE PROMISED LAND;;"I have built my life on the solid Rock
Far away from the sinking sand
And I cast my eyes to the home 
that waits
On the banks of the Promised Land

CHORUS
Hallelujah, what a morning
When I reach for that 
nail-scarred hand
And I'm led from grace to glory
On the banks of the Promised Land

There's a song of praise that is
lifted there
By the saints and the angel band
And I long to go and to join the choir
On the banks of the Promised Land

Every grief and pain that has found 
me here
Jesus knows, and He understands
They'll be washed away as I cross 
death's stream
To the banks of the Promised Land

Then I'll see the face of my Savior 
dear
Beckoned close by His sweet 
command
All my burdens gone; I will rest at last
On the banks of the Promised Land"
1276;LEAD ME LORD;;"It's hard to take the first step
When I don't know the way
Each turn is so uncertain
I learn to walk by faith
But you gave me a promise
That you will never leave
You will lead and guide me
Lord I do believe

CHORUS
Lead me lord
I will follow
Lead me Lord
I will go
You have called me
I will answer
Lead me Lord
I will go

Your plans for me are perfect
I never need to fear
For though at times I feel alone
I know that you are near
My heart just longs to follow
I'm willing to obey
Take my hand and lead me
I follow all the way"
1277;SOMEBODY TOUCHED ME;;"Many years he walked in darkness
As he groped along the streets
With his hands stretched out for pennies
Or for just a bite to eat
It's the story of the blind man
Who met Jesus on his way
And with the Master's touch, the man 
 looked up
As the scoffers heard him say

CHORUS
Somebody touched me
Somebody touched me
I was blind, but praise His name, 
  I now can see
I was in darkness when Jesus 
 found me
But since He touched me I now 
  am free

One day He touched the crippled man
And made him walk again
And the Master saw with pleasure
He had labored not in vain
Like the story of that crippled man
I once was bound by sin
But since the Master came, 
  oh, praise His name
Thank God, I now can say"
1278;PRAYING WATCHING WAITING;;"Promised when you went away
you'll be back
Been waiting a long time
havent seen you yet
But I've learnt to trust in you 
Know youll do what you say you will do
So I'll keep praying
watching and waiting for you

CHORUS
So I keep praying,
watching and waiting
Hoping youll be back before too long,
You know I love you
and I am thinking of you
So I keep praying
watching and waiting for you

Thank you for the letters you

about my future home
They say you went away to build it hope

1279;LET ME SING YOUR BRIDE A SONG;;"To the world the bride has
never looked so defeated,
While waiting for the promise 
of the rapture its seem so long,
I know she's struggling through this world 
trying to make heaven her home,
So lord let me sing your bride a song,

CHORUS
Let this song be something 
about this message
Like Christ the mystery of God 
revealed or the seven seals,
Desperation, the token or leadership
or the future home
Lord let me sing your bride a song

Well I've always wanted to do 
something special for Jesus,
But what could i offer him
that he don't already own,
But i know what i do for him
would be for his people,
Lord let me sing your bride a song."
1280;TAKE ME DEEPER;;"There is a longing
only You can fill
A raging tempest
only You can still
My soul is thirsty Lord
to know You as I'm known
Drink from the river
that flows before Your throne

CHORUS
Take me deeper
Deeper in love with You
Jesus hold me close in Your embrace
Take me deeper
Deeper than I've ever been before
I just want to love You more and more
How I long to be deeper in love

Sunrise to sunrise
I will seek Your face
Drawn by the Spirit
to the promise of Your grace
My heart has found in You
a hope that will abide
Here in Your presence
forever satisfied"
1281;KEEP ME TRUE;;"Keep me true, Lord Jesus
Keep me true
Keep me true, Lord Jesus
Keep me true
There's a race I must run, there are 
victories to be won
Give me power every hour to be true

Hold my hand, Lord Jesus
Hold my hand
Hold my hand, Lord Jesus
Hold my hand
There's a race I must run, there are 
victories to be won
Give me power every hour to be true

Walk with me, Lord Jesus
Walk with me
Walk with me, Lord Jesus
Walk with me
There's a race I must run, there are 
victories to be won
Give me power every hour to be true


Lord help me run in the race,
Help me not bring you disgrace,
But let me rise on wings of faith,
Until the day I’ll see your face."
1282;BEHOLD THE LAMB;;"Whose that man with a cross 
on his shoulder?
Struggling now beneath the heavy load,
Is there no one to relieve him 
of his burden?
To help him walk that long dusty road,

CHORUS
Behold the lamb of God 
sent from heaven,
To take the sins of this poor world all away,
Behold the lamb of God freely given,
They've crucified my saviour today,

Is he tired,is he bleeding, is he crying?
Struggling now to climb calvary's hill,
They are mocking his name and casting 
rocks now,
The earth has darkened, time is now 
standing still,

And they are nailing his precious body
 to the cross now,
Is that a soldier i see piercing his side?
I hear him asking ""father please, please
 forgive them,""
This is God's son whom the world 
has crucified,"
1283;CALL ON ME CHILD;;"CHORUS
Call on me child for I am here 
to help you
Call on Me for I will never 
let you down
Call on Me child for when you 
grow so weary
Call on Me for I am your friend

Often times as we're walking 
through the valley
It seems our way grows so 
dark and dim
When it seems that you can 
go no farther
A voice from Heaven speaks to 
you from within

Many times we have read it 
in the Bible
How God's people were often 
at their end
But time and time the Lord He 
delivered them
through fire, through flood, even in 
a lion's den"
1284;HE TOOK NOTHING AND MADE SOMETHING;;"When there were no birds to fly 
And the rivers all were dry 
God took nothing and made 
something of me 
When there were no flowers to bloom 
And there was no sun or moon 
God took nothing and made 
something of me 

CHORUS
When the earth was null and void 
And there was no light to see 
And the land was not parted 
from the sea 
He knew back then, I'd need a friend 
A friend who loved me to the end 
He took nothing and made 
something of me 

When my sins were not forgiven 
And down on my knees were driven 
God took nothing and made 
something of me 
He forgave me all my sins 
Brought sweet joy and peace within 
God took nothing and made 
something of me"
1285;THE LONG ARM OF LOVE;;"Out in the badlands, a heart 
on the run
Haunted and guilty from the things
that you've done
You were wanted by justice, 
dead or alive
Then you're cleared of the charges
By the blood of Christ

CHORUS
You can't outrun the long arm of love
God's mercy rides on, when justice 
gives up
wherever you are, you cant go far 
enough whatever you've done,
You cant outrun the long 
arm of love

Longing for shelter, thirsty and dry
a life ruined and wasted, and 
sentenced to die
it useless to keep up, with this 
maddening pace
raise your hands and surrender, 
to amazing grace"
1286;GO TO THE MASTER;;"When there's no place to go, you think 
no one knows, 
what you're going through.
When you've done all you can, you're 
exhausted my friend, 
and there's nothing else left you can do.
When life overwhelms you, or someone betrays you,
you feel like nobody cares,
There's still one place I know, when there's 
no place to go, 
I can go to the Master in
prayer.

Chorus
I can go to the Master, He always listens, 
He welcomes my pleas because He cares about
me, He won't overlook my petition.
He's standing above, and He's watching in love, 
He's waiting my burdens to bear,
He's got time for you, and a place for me too,
I can go to the Master in prayer.

When the world turns on me, I'm so blind I can't see,
doubts are everywhere.
When friends turn me down, and my spirit is bound, 
I can't rise above all my fears.
When pain won't release me, there's no peace within me,
I'm feeling like life isn't fair,
When my night's sleep is lost, and I've turned 
and I've tossed, 
I can go to the Master in prayer."
1287;GOD LIKES TO WORK WHEN NOTHING ELSE WILL;;"You been to the doctor and he 
just shook his head 
so many nights you've suffered 
just lying in bed, 
but you just can't seem to make it, 
your body is ill 
Friend God likes to work when 
nothing else will 

CHORUS
God likes to work when your 
back's to the wall 
when your fates in the balance and 
your just about to fall 
so they'll be no mistaken when 
he blesses and heals 
Oh God likes to work when 
nothing else will. 

You've met with the banker, he 
said no with regret 
you've tried every way, just to 
get ahead, 
but your hoping and praying for 
a miracle still 
Oh God likes to work when 
nothing else will.

You've been praying with 
persistence for God's blessings
to fall. 
Seeking with patience, 
you've prayed all night through. 
And you're holding on to faith 
even though your spirit is weak. 
Friend, God likes to work when 
nothing else will."
1288;ALWAYS BE A CHILD;;"I was there when you drew the breath 
of life and I could hear your voice 
The first time that you cried,and though 
you couldn't see me I was very near,and 
there's something now,that I want 
you to hear.

Chorus
You will always be a child in my eyes, 
And when you need some love my arms 
are open wide,and even when you're 
growing old I hope you realize.
You will always be a child in my eyes.

And I was there the first time that 
you prayed 
And I heard all the promises you made 
And when you fell before me Crying father 
I have sinned I picked you up,and held 
you close again."
1289;SUCH A TIME AS THIS;;"Why did I walk through the valley
Why was I forced to my knees?
Why did the sun parch and dry me,
As I walked through the desert of 
defeat.
Then came the clouds and the rain fell,
I thought I'd never make it through 
the night.
But God gave me the answer when 
I prayed with you,
He let me see the dark to hold the light.

CHORUS
I can kneel with a brother who is 
bearing a burden
And say I know just what you're going 
through.
I can pray with a sister in the midst of 
her sorrow
And say I know because I've been there too.
I can put my arms around someone who 
is down
And tell them to have faith and confidence.
What in pain I could not see I now truly 
believe,
God prepared me for such a time as this.

You may be praying for rescue.
You are facing temptations and trials.
Struggles are endlessly present,
But the purpose is somewhere in God's time.
Just keep on walkin' the good road.
Night leads to a stronger, wiser day,
And when you're asked the reason 
for the path you have trod,
You'll know without a doubt and 
you can say...."
1290;TILL THE STORM PASSES OVER;;"In the dark of the midnight have 
I oft hid my face
While the storm howls above me, 
and there's no hiding place
'Mid the crash of the thunder, Precious Lord, 
hear my cry
Keep me safe till the storm passes by

CHORUS
Till the storm passes over, till the 
thunder sounds no more
Till the clouds roll forever from the sky
Hold me fast, let me stand in the 
hollow of Thy hand
Keep me safe till the storm passes by

Many times Satan whispered, 
""There is no need to try
For there's no end of sorrow, there's 
no hope by and by""
But I know Thou art with me, and tomorrow 
I'll rise
Where the storms never darken the skies

When the long night has ended and the storms 
come no more
Let me stand in Thy presence on the bright 
peaceful shore
In that land where the tempest, never comes, 
Lord, may I
Dwell with Thee when the storm passes by"
1291;WE SERVE A GOD WHO NEVER FAILS;;"We serve a God who never fails,
We serve a God who never fails
We serve a God who never fails,
Who never fails, who never fails,
Forevermore"
1292;IT'S JESUS I WANT TO SEE;;"I've truly known the good life
Filled with family and friends
I've blessed with more than my share
Yet with all of my good fortunes
My heart is sinking still
Oh I just cant deny the longing there

CHORUS
It's Jesus I really want to see X2
The more I see of this world
The less it means to me
The end is Jesus I really want to see

I've been in lots of places
And I've known the great and small
Ive seen the grand and noble works of men
But in the heart of my hearts
I know there's more for me
So much more than this faded world am in"
1293;LET YOUR WORD BE BORN;;"Twas a tiny simple stable
All beaten and worn
Hardly a place
For King to be born
He didn't choose some place special
To reveal His majesty 
So I know if I'll give Him control
He'll be born in me

Chorus
Let Your Word be born 
In the manger of my heart 
Let it live in me, Let it start
Live inside this house of clay 
And mold me everyday
Let your Word be born 
In the manger of my heart

Outwardly I'm nothing
Not much to behold
Unlikely the place
For God's Word to unfold
But if I'll just yield this vessel
And let Him have His way
From Glory unto Glory 
He'll change me day by day"
1294;UNTIL I REACH MY HOME;;"Chorus
Until I reach my home
Until I reach my home
I never expect to give my journey over
Until I reach my home,

Old Satan's mighty busy
He follows me night and day
And every time I go to pray
I find him on my way

Now don't you mind old Satan
With all his tempting charms
He wants to steal your soul away
And fold you in his arms

When I was lying at hells dark door
No one to pity over me
Master Jesus He come riding by
And bought my liberty"
1295;BILA WEWE YESU SIWEZI;;"Bila Wewe Bwana Siwezi
Bila Wewe Bwana Siwezi"
1296;TO BE MORE LIKE YOU;;"Chorus
To be more like You, to be 
more like You
Every minute, every hour
To be more like you
To concecrate our lives 
A living sacrifice
Lord, that is our heart's desire
to be more like You

Lord We consecrate our hearts 
to be molded in your arms
A piece of clay in the potter's hands
May you circumcise our hearts
take all our passions and our lusts
That all we'll desire is to be more like you

Oh that you may make us salty
in a world that is longing
That when they may see us they maybe
 thirsty
An image of Christ being manifested 
and His righteousness reflected 
A masterpiece molded by His hands

Thou discener of all our thoughts 
And the intents of our hearts
Bare and naked we are to thee
What could we hide from the Oh Lord
Thou Omnicient and Omnipresent
We lay it all to thee, that you may 
make us clean"
1297;ON A JOURNEY;;"We are on a journey, destination 
Heaven,
Every step brings us closer home;
Keep your eyes on Jesus,
Knowing that He'll lead us;
To that land where streets are 
purest gold.

CHORUS
Walking together, towards heaven
Talking and singing about Heaven.
Brothers and sisters,
Members of the family of God.
I can't wait to meet Him,
Don't you want to be there,
When the saints all go marching in?
Some from every nation,
What a celebration!
Hand in hand together with the Lord.

Those who've gone before us,
Leap aboard to greet us;
As we walk, through the gates 
of pearl.
We'll bow our knees before Him,
Worship and adore Him;
It's the church forever with the Lord."

That I have cried 

Oh, He came down
And held me tight 
And He said, my child 
You are mine!

I went down 
On my knees 
And I asked the Lord
Have mercy, please

And hold out your candle for all to see it 
Take your candle, and go light your world

For strength to ever do the right,
For grace to conquer in the fight,
For power to walk the world in white,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

To make our weak hearts strong and brave,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
To live a dying world to save,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

Our lives, our all, this very day;
To crown the offering now we pray,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!"
1304;WHAT A SAVIOUR!;;"I've walked through vast valleys, 
surrounded by mountains,
with peaks that seemed too high to climb.
But I recall learning, how great 
mountain climbers,
they conquered one step at a time.
I've watched blue rivers, strong currents raging,
I wondered if they could be crossed.
But my rivers and mountains, became soft 
gentle fountains,
because of an old rugged cross.               

CHORUS                   
We have a Saviour, such a wonderful 
Saviour.
Mercies atonment, stifled sin's judgement, 
and Grace made intercession, I'm free.
The pain and the heartache, that old suffering 
I can't take, purchased redemption for me, 
The True Lamb of Calvary is the 
hope of Salvation,                
He died on an old rugged tree.....             

I've walked down sidewalks, of bright 
neon cities,
Where the skyscrapers reached for the sky.
I've seen the rich and the famous, in their 
glamour and glitter.
as they searched for some joy in the night.
While a few blocks from main street, in a old 
cardboard ghetto,
Another unknown life is lost, whether 
penthouse or skid row,
There's one thing I still know, there's hope in 
an old rugged cross."
1305;MY EYES ARE DRY;;"My eyes are dry
My faith is old
My heart is hard
My prayers are cold
And I know how I ought to be
Alive to You and dead to me

But what can be done
For an old heart like mine
Soften it up
With oil and wine
The oil is You, Your Spirit of love
Please wash me anew
With the wine of Your Blood"
1306;LAND OF FADELESS DAY;;"In the land of fadeless day
Lies the city foursquare;
It shall never pass away,
And there is no night there.

CHORUS
God shall wipe away all tears,
There's no death, no pain, nor fears,
And they count not time by years,
For there is no night there.

All the gates of pearl are made,
In the city foursquare;
All the streets with gold are laid,
And there is no night there.

All the gates shall never close
To the city foursquare;
There life's crystal river flows,
And there is no night there.

There they need no sunshine bright,
In that city foursquare;
For the Lamb is all the light,
And there is no night there.

1307;GOD IS IN THE SHADOWS;;"I'm just a little flower here I'm blooming 
by this rock,
Sometimes it feels so lonely in this 
isolated spot,
But living in the valley where He's placed me 
here to grow,
I try to do my best for Him, He sees me 
now I know.

CHORUS
Yes, God is in the shadows, in the valley 
here below,
He sees one tiny flower as its beauty softly glows, 
He never fails one time, each tiny detail 
He controls,
Yes, God is in the shadows, He is every 
where I go.

He gives me morning sunshine & the cool 
and gentle rain,
He softly smiles upon me as I spend a few 
short days,
He loves me as He made me, He's a loving 
Heavenly King
I'm never all alone, He is always watching me."
1308;HOLY HANDS OF JESUS;;"I never knew how far in sins I wondered,
I never knew how tight was Satan's 
bound,
Until I heard the message of salvation,
And felt the touch of Him with 
Holy hands

CHORUS
Holy hands, the Holy hands of Jesus,
Holy hands, with scars of Calvary,
Holy hands, outstretched with grace 
and pardon,
Holy hands, one day they lifted me.

Forever now his Holy hands shall 
guide me,
Safe and secure my needs he 
understands,
No harm shall come my life is in 
his keeping,
Some day & soon I will see his 
Holy hands"
1309;I'LL NEVER LEAVE HOME;;"I have many friends on the other shore
I got a buddy there I know
I've had to look down in the face of 
many of my loved ones
Lord I hated to see them go
One by one they're leaving here
If time lasts we'll all be gone
But God said he'll go and build a place where 
We'll never have to leave home

CHORUS
I'll never leave home
I'll never leave home
Every place I put my feet am going home
There'll be a million miles of mountain plains
Valleys fields and streams
With the daily cares of this life all gone
I'll never have to leave home

I was driving down the road
Late one night, i've been to sing the bride a song
And I was thinking about how lonely it gets
that old highway seems so long
then up ahead, i see a sign'
that says ""WELCOME HOME TO THE CITY""
but am looking for another sign that says
""WELCOME TO ETERNITY"""
1310;SUPPERTIME;;"Many years ago in days of childhood
I used to play till evenin' shadows come
Then windin' down that old familiar 
pathway
I'd hear my mother call at set of sun

CHORUS
Come home, come home it's 
supper time
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's 
supper time
We're going home at last

Some of the fondest memories of 
my childhood
Were woven around supper time
When my mother used to call
From the backsteps of the old homeplace
""Come on home now son, it's supper time""

Ah, but I'd love to hear that once more
But you know for me time has woven 
the realization of the truth that's 
even more thrilling and 
that's when
The call come up from the portals of glory
To come home, for it's supper time
When all of God's children
Shall gather around the table
Of the Lord himself
And the greatest supper time of them all"
1311;I KNOW A MAN WHO CAN;;"I can't take a heart that's broken
make it over again 
But I know a man who can 
I can't take a soul that's sin sick
wash it whiter than snow
But I know a man who can 

Chorus
Some call Him Savior the
Redeemer of all men 
But I call Him Jesus
for He's my dearest friend 
If you think that no one can help you 
and your life is out of hand 
I know a man who can 

I can't walk upon the water
and I can't calm the raging sea 
But I know a man who can 
I can't cause blind eyes to open
get the lame to walk again 
But I know a man who can"
1312;LOOK TO HIM;;"When the storms of doubt
within your life are raging
when all hope is gone
no answer can be found,
remember there is one
who never will forsake you
dont give up
For He will never let you down

CHORUS
Look to Him
Keep your eyes upon the saviour
trust in Jesus, the one who really cares
Put your hand in the hand of the man
who never fails
when you need a friend 
look to Him

Now with a childlike faith
you can move your mountain
with a simple prayer
your answer can be found
dont turn away
there is no one else to turn to
look to Jesus
He will never let you down"
1313;JOY COMES IN THE MORNING;;"Tears often fall on my face in sorrow,
And as I walk on  through the long 
lonely nights
Often I cry when it seems no one hears me
Then through the shadows i can see the 
dawning of light

CHORUS
Oh soon this old life with all of its trials
Will be left behind there is a new day 
a dawning
The shadows of sin will vanish forever
He promised me there's going to be a joy 
in the morning

Tears cannot stain the pathway
of glory
No broken hearts we'll find up there
Beyond that sky my mansions are waiting
By the light of the morning
We'll sing the songs of sweet victory

Hold on my child joy comes in the 
morning
Weeping only lasts for the night
Hold on my child joy comes in the 
morning
Oh the darkest hour means dawn is
just in sight"
1314;THE OLD LOVE LETTER;;"I found an old Love Letter that was
written just for me,
It told me how much I am loved, sweet 
and tenderly,
With a broken heart I read each line, 
of God's love for me,
It was written by a nail scarred 
hand at Calvary! 

CHORUS
Oh how this old Love Letter spoke to
my heart and soul. 
I was captured by every word as I 
watched His love unfold. 
With special care He wrote it down for 
all eternity. 
It was written by a nail-scarred 
hand at Calvary! 

I found the old Love Letter, the pages 
stained with red,
I am yours eternally is what the 
postscript said,
I treasure my Letter, that he nailed 
upon that tree,
My tears stains it's pages every 
time I read."

And I act so foolishly
Facing problems on my own
I don't know what's best for me
My mistakes at times disturb
All the plans You have made
Lord keep me in Your will
So I won't be in Your way

So put me where You want to
Not where I want to be
If I should ask for things, I want

So I won't be in Your way

Remind me Lord, I'm just a glove
In which You place Your hand

The life everlasting if ye would obtain,

Prepare ye the way of the Lord!

CHORUS
Behold He comes, riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun at the trumpet's call
Lift your voice, year of Jubilee
Out of Zion's hill, salvation comes

And these are the days of Ezekiel
The dry bones becoming flesh
And these are the days of 
Your servant, David
Rebuilding a temple of praise
And these are the days of the harvest
The fields are all white in Your world
And we are the laborers 
that are in Your vineyard
Declaring the Word of the Lord

 He's always there to listen.
When arms fold without me,

 what would I do?

When my tears flow like a river and 
my burdens are high as a mountain,
When the ones that I've counted on

 He's the one that I can count on.
I couldn't make it without Jesus,

I know I'd be healed, my sins are forgiven
If I could just touch Him, I know I'd be whole

Nobody to help him down life's weary way
Then Jesus passed by and He heard His sad crying
He reached down His hand 
And He healed Him that day

Nobody to help me down life's weary way
Then Jesus came by and He heard my sad crying

door open wide and wide,
I see a throne of Grace in there,
Oh yes I see the 
Lamb sitting on the throne,
Thunders and lightning 
in worship all around.

CHORUS 
Holy Holy Holy 
Lord God Almighty,
Who was, and is and is to come
 
Before the throne 
a sea of glass like crystal, 
Four living creatures 
with light fronted out,
Each day I've heard 
voices of worship never end,
To Him who died now 
glorified upon the throne.

Twenty four elders 
fall down and worship the
Lamb upon the throne,
Casting their crowns to 
Him who is forever,
You are worthy oh Lord, 
Lord God Almighty,
To receive, to receive 
Glory and honour and
power and praise."
1337;IT IS NO SECRET;;"The chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Some one slipped and fell
Was that someone you?
You may have longed for added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
I have news for you

Chorus
It is no secret what God can do
What he has done for others
He'll do for you
With arms wide open
He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do

There is no night, for in His light
You'll never walk alone
You'll always feel at home wherever 
you may roam
There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide"

Let every heart, sweet music make
And sing with eyes, for Jesus sake
God is Love, God is Love

Oh sing to earths, most distant lands
God is Love, God is Love
In Christ we are, made whole again
God is Love, God is Love

His blood has washed, our sin away
His spirit turned, our night to day
And with great joy, our hearts can say
God is Love, God is Love

One day we'll sing, with all the saints
God is Love, God is Love
We'll fully know then, face to face

We'll triumph find, the heavenly throne
And this shall be, our sweetest song
God is Love, God is Love"
1339;I THEN SHALL LIVE;;"I then shall live as 
one who's been forgiven.
I'll walk with joy to 
know my debts are paid.
I know my name is 
clear before my Father; 
I am His child and 
I am not afraid.
So, greatly pardoned, 
I'll forgive my brother;
The law of love I gladly will obey.

I then shall live as one 
who's learned compassion.
I've been so loved, 
that I'll risk loving too.
I know how fear builds 
walls instead of bridges;
I'll dare to see another's point of view.
And when relationships 
demand commitment,
Then I'll be there to 
care and follow through.

Your Kingdom come around 
and through and in me;
Your power and glory, 
let them shine through me.
Your Hallowed Name, 
O may I bear with honor,
And may Your living 
Kingdom come in me.

The Bread of Life, 
O may I share with honor,
And may You feed 
a hungry world through me.
Amen, Amen, Amen"
1340;THE ANSWER IS ON THE WAY;;"Many times  I  bowed  
beneath  the  heavy  load.
On bended knees to God a prayer I prayed. 
As  I  knelt  there  on  the  floor, 
He'd  remind  me  just  once  more, 
that  the  answer  was  already  on  the  way. 

CHORUS
Oh  yes  the  answer's  on  the  way, 
 this  I  know. 
Jesus  said  it  I  believe  it  to  be  so. 
Our  heavenly  Father  knows  
the  need  before  we  pray. 
And  we  can  rest  assured  
the  answer's  on  the  way.

If  there's  a  special  need  
within  your  life  my  friend. 
And  you're  making  
for  the  answer  every  day. 
If  by  faith  you'll  start  believing, 
Mighty  soon  you'll  start  believing, 
for  the  answer  is  already  on  the  way. 

The  answer  came, 
while  I  was  kneeling  there  in  prayer. 
The  answer  came,  
I  felt  His  saving  might  powr. 
When  the  Saviour  came  and  save  my  soul, 
He  caused  the  angry  billows  to  go. 
Now  I'm  praising  the  Lord  
each, that  the  answer  came."

1342;SOMEBODY TOUCHED ME;;"Many years he walked in darkness
As he groped along the streets
With his hands stretched out for pennies
Or for just a bite to eat
It's the story of the blind man
Who met Jesus on his way
And with the Master's touch, the man 
looked up
As the scoffers heard him say

CHORUS
Somebody touched me
Somebody touched me
I was blind, but praise His name, 
I now can see
I was in darkness when Jesus found me
But since He touched me I now am free

One day He touched the crippled man
And made him walk again
And the Master saw with pleasure
He had labored not in vain
Like the story of that crippled man
I once was bound by sin
But since the Master came, 
Oh, praise, His name
Thank God, I now can say"
1343;THE HAND OF THE LORD;;"You can hear the wind blow
But theres no one who knows
Where its blowing
Sometimes its the wind gently 
starring the winds as its blowing
Thats how it feels when the Spirit 
within starts to flowing
Like a wind and its warm gentle 
touch from the hand of the Lord

CHORUS
The Hand of the Lord 
has the strength to move mountains
Forge rivers and valleys, 
and make oceans run dry
And the very same Hands, 
holds the sparrows thats fallen
What a blessing to know, 
wherever I go, His Hand's holding mine

There are times we all know there's 
simply nowhere to go but to Jesus
Though the tempest may blow, 
He has promised He won't ever leave us
At the end of the road 
He will carry the load for the weakest
Saying ""Listen to me stand still""
and see the hand of the Lord"

1345;HOPE;;"The hope that is within us,
erupting from the sand,
It's clear and pure refreshment 
in dry and barren land,
No scotching circumstances, 
can stop that eager flow, 
of hope that springs eternal
It's joy that floods my soul  

CHORUS
O Jesus, blessed Jesus,
 my wellspring in the sand,
O Jesus, blessed Jesus, 
my strong and saving Hand,
O Jesus, blessed Jesus,
my anchor tether rope, 
The voice that stills all rages, 
my shouting whispering hope  

It's a hope that sometimes whispers, 
A hope that sometimes shouts! 
And sometimes hope's mighty gale 
will part the sea of doubt 
Or calms the raging fevers, 
commands the storms of pain 
Hope turns the life's threatening tempest,
to gentle soothing rain"
1346;NO LONGER A SLAVE;;"You unravel me, with a melody

Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again, into a family
Your blood flows through my veins

I am surrounded
By the arms of the father
I am surrounded
By songs of deliverance
We've been liberated
From our bondage
Were the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
And I will stand and sing
I am the child of God"
1347;LET THY WILL;;"The clouds got so dark
The cold winds of trials, began to blow.
I thought to myself,
Alone I'll have to stand
When I saw one
Set of foot prints in this sand 
But God purpose,I now see
In His arms he carries me
Am dying to my on way of thinking
I know I'll rise in victory,so

You have been my Guide,
Help me to follow ,

Teach me to trust you
Lord teach me to obey
Without you Lord
 I just cannot find my way
So let me never,ever stray close to you, 
I'll always stay
No longer leaning on my understanding 
father, I submit to you

Now I've come to know
That you'll never leave me
nor forsake me
Coz I'm been lead, by your divine hand
Through this ordained, path way you have planned
And in your suffering,
 we have now sweet fellowship
Now that you ,dwell with me
 in your perfect will,
 I'll always want to be, father.."
1348;BLOODLINE;;"Even though my spirit's low, 
and it seems i can't hardly go,
But still, I see victory
Many times I'm walking by faith,
And can't see what lies before me, 
but still i see victory.

CHORUS
I just gotta tell you satan, 
you can't cross the bloodline,
Because I'm covered by His blood,
And you may stare and you may fight
But you're gonna lose this
battle tonight,
Cause remember you can't 
cross the bloodline.

Sometimes our battles get hot,
And it seems we're fighting alot,
Oh i remember, I'm standing on the rock,
So satan, if I were you,
I'd turn around and give up too,
Cause I do believe - you're bound to lose.

You may stare and you may fight
But you're gonna lose this battle tonight
Cause remember you 
can't cross the bloodline

you can't cross the bloodline."

No Tear dimmed eyes
Where all is love

And the soul (of man) never dies

Where the soul of man never dies
And I will spend eternity
Where the soul of man never dies"
1350;THIS COULD BE THE DAWNING;;"A parade began at Calvary
The saints of all the ages fill its ranks
O'er the sands of time they're marching
To their King's great coronation
And this could be the dawning of that day!

CHORUS
This could be the dawning
Of that grand and glorious day
When the face of Jesus we behold
Dreams and hopes of all the ages
Are awaiting His returning
And this could be dawning of that day!

All the saints are getting restless
They're not bound by shackles
Forged of earthly gold
Since that day they knelt at Calvary
They've been pilgrims ever wandering
Just looking for a place to rest their souls

Until then my heart will go on singing
Until then with joy I'll carry on!
Dreams and hopes of all the ages
Are awaiting His returning
And this could be the dawning of that day!
This could be the dawning
Of that great and glorious morning
Oh this could be the dawning of that day!
Of that day!"
1351;I WAS THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED;;"There are some people who say 
we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and 
trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened 
and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me, 
(saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me, 
(made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within, 
(peace within)

Satan can't make me doubt it, 
(I won't doubt it)
It's real and I'm going to shout it, 
(I'm going to shout it)
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
Though the world may argue, that 
we cannot feel
The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
I was there when it happened and so I 
guess I ought to know

What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
Oh what peace we often forfeit,
Oh what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!"
1352;JESUS IS PASSING THIS WAY;;"CHORUS
Jesus is passing this way,
This way, today;
Jesus is passing this way,
Is passing this way today.

Is there a heart that has wandered?
Come with thy burden today;
Mercy is tenderly pleading,
Jesus is passing this way.

Is there a heart that is broken?
Weary and sighing for rest?
Come to the arms of the Savior,
Pillow thy head on His breast.

Come to thy only Redeemer,
Come to His infinite love;
Come to the gate that is leading
Homeward to mansions above."
1353;HOW MUCH FURTHER CAN WE GO;;"We've thrown away the principles our 
land was founded on
How much further can we go
We've put aside morality for society
How much further can we go

CHORUS
The common forms of decency have
 fell beneath our feet
The Golden Rule that God gave us 
has only met defeat
We even recognize a man who say 
that God is dead
How much further can we go

Our people speak of peace when there 
is war on every hand
How much further can we go
No longer are our children taught of 
love for every man
How much further can we go"
1354;LOOK TO HIM;;"When the storms of doubt within 
your life are raging.
When all hope is gone, no answer 
can be found.
Remember there is one who never 
will forsake you.
Trust in Jesus, for He will never 
let you down.

CHORUS
Look to Him, keep your eyes 
upon the Savior.
Trust in Jesus, the one who really cares.
Put your hand in the hand of the man 
who never fails.
When you need a friend, look to Him.

Now with a childlike faith, you can 
move your mountain.
With a simple prayer, your answer 
can be found.
Don't turn away, there is no one 
else to turn to.
Don't give up, for He will never 
let you down."
1355;I BELIEVE HE'S COMING BACK;;"High upon a mountain
From where He ascended
An angel of The Lord
Declared that it would be
He said don't stand there grieving
For the one that you see leaving
In like Manner He's coming back 
for you and me

CHORUS
And I believe He's coming back 
like He said
I believe that the trumpets gonna
 sound so loud 
one day it'll wake the dead
In the twinkling of an eye
He'll split the Eastern sky
And I believe He's coming back 
like He said

I believe the time is nearing
Well soon see His appearing
This could be the hour
Oh this could be the day
When the saints from every nation
Will lose their gravitation
In the middle if the air
Be caught away"

Since Jesus came into my heart.

CHORUS
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the 
sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I have ceased from my wand'ring 
and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins which were many are 
all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I'm possessed of a hope that is 
steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And no dark clouds of doubt now 
my pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

There's a light in the valley of death 
now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And the gates of the City 
beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I shall go there to dwell in that 
City I know,

How I came to Him that day I can't 
explain 
Oh the joy and peace that's bubbling

I just know within my heart that Jesus 
made me whole

CHORUS
Once again I'd like to thank Him 
of His love divine
Nothing else could take His place 
and give me peace of mind 
Without Jesus in my heart I  would have 
died in sin 
Once again I'd like to thank Him 
that He drew me in

You can live a life that the people may say 
there's a man that's nice
You can give to the poor do all these things 
but if you're heart's not right 
For the Bible plainly says, you must be 
born again
For without His love in you, 
it would be all in vain"

I shall forever lift mine eyes to 
Calvary
to view the cross where Jesus 
died for me,
how marvelous the grace that caught 
my falling soul,
he looked beyond my faults and 
saw my need.

Redeeming blood my Savior shed 
for me one day,
to restore me back to where I used to be,
he became my sin so I could be 
his righteousness,
when he looked beyond my fault and 
saw my need.

If not for grace, my soul would be

With no safe harbor from the angry waves
But Calvary's cross shines brightly through 
the darkest storm
And just in time, His mercy rescues me!"

Na ahurukie wendo-ini wake."
1370;I'LL TAKE JESUS;;"As they gambled for the robe He wore
They chose a worldly trail
And they didn't think of eternity
As the soldiers drove the nails
Will we learn from what they done
Or make the same mistake
Jesus or the world my child
Which one will you take

CHORUS
I'll take Jesus, I'll take Jesus
I tried these worldly pleasures and 
they failed
When you see the gates of Heaven
And you hear the Master say
Me or the world my child
Which one will you take

When the pages of my life have turned
And time has rolled away
The greatest deeds that I have done
Won't help me on that day
And all my earthly treasures
That I have laid away
They'll be to me just a memory
And this you'll hear me say"
1371;YET YOU HAVE CALLED ME;;"When I consider the work of

1372;LORD I'M READY TO GO HOME;;"Through the valley of this life I have 
wondered,
And I've worked for Jesus all along the way.
But now life's evening sun for 
me is setting,
I have reached the ending of my way.

CHORUS
Lord I've been faithful in the service 
you have given.
And the harvest of the fields lord I
have done.
But now my steps are growing weary.
Lord i'm ready i'm ready to go home

Looking back upon the life I've lived 
for Jesus,
I can see how he has helped me all the way.
And the tears I've shed just helped to keep 
me humble.
And each burden only taught me how to pray.

Tho I have to leave so many friends 
behind me,
And the parting of our ways will 
touch my heart.
But I'll wait for them inside the gates 
of heaven,
Where the children of God will never part."
1373;PRAISE HIS NAME;;"When you're up against a wall and your 
mountain seems so tall
And you realize that life's not always fair
You can run away and hide, let the old 
man decide
Or you can change your circumstances 
with a prayer

When everything falls apart praise
 His name
When you have a broken heart raise 
your hands and say
Lord, You're all I need, You're 
everything to me
And He'll take the pain away

When it seem you're all alone 
praise His name
When you feel you can't go on just raise 
your hands and say
Greater is He that is within me
And you can praise the hurt away

Oh, you can overcome by the 
blood of the lamb
And by the word of your testimony
You'll see the darkness go as your faith 
begins to grow
You're not alone so how can you 
be lonely

TRANSPOSE 
When everything falls apart praise 
His name
When you have a broken heart raise
 your hands and say
Lord, You're all I need, You're 
everything to me
And He'll take the pain away

When it seem you're all alone 
praise His name
When you feel you can't go on just 
raise your hands and say
Greater is He that is within me
And you can praise the hurt away
Greater is He that is within me
And you can praise the hurt away

If you just Praise His name"
1374;IF THAT MOUNTAIN DON'T MOVE;;"I've cried a river of tears though it seems,
And the pain in my heart is a hurt that 
won't leave,
Still I stand by the choice, that I made 
long ago, 
I'm going through,
Lord I brought nothing here when I came,
So if I lose it all, I'll still praise your name,
I have peace of mind, I know you'll teach 
me to climb,
If that mountain don't move.

CHORUS
Oh Lord I don't know what tomorrow 
will bring,
Hoping for sunshine, preparing for rain,
Whatever I face, I'll trust in your grace, 
to carry me through,
My feet are so weary, at times I can't stand,
But you hold me up, When I've done all I can,
Like so many times, I know you'll teach 
me to climb,
If that mountain don't move.

I've spent long nights, 
When sleep never came,
And it seemed like my loss, far out 
numbered my gain,
But I held on to hope, as it led the way, 
I made it through,
The tempter determind, that I would give in,
But grace made a way, for me to pass 
through again,
I have peace of mind, your gonna teach 
me to climb,
Lord if that mountain don't move."
1375;THAT DAY ON CALVARY;;"Well I've always want to write a love song
dedicated to the Lord, I have so many things I
want to thank him for
Especially His word
All the songs He let me sing just to bless His
bride
""Whose worthy,"" ""Be Not Afraid"", "" All is well""
and ""My guide""

I just wanna sing I love you
And magnify your name
Thank you for the sunshine Lord, Thank you
for the rain, thanks for all the places I've 
been and all the things I've seen, that day on 
calvary and Lord I thank thee

I can never say the right words to explain
how much I really care for when I found I
needed you most Lord, you'd be there,
how you watched oe'r me all my life and never left
me alone and let me choose you this day and 
I'll never have to leave home"
1376;I WANT TO THANK JESUS;;"I want to thank Jesus for the 
plan of salvation
Just to say Lord I love you for 
you understand
I want to be there on that great 
judgement morning
Just to touch on the nail prints 
on His feet and His hands

One morning at daybreak, 
a crowd slowly gathered
They were walking my Lord there, 
up Calvary's hill
So sad was the scene there, 
the birds hushed their singing
Like a sheep he was humble 
to His Father's own wiill"
1377;THERE'S NO CONDEMNATION;;"Therefore now there's no condemnation
Therefore now there's no condemnation
Therefore now there's no condemnation
There's no condemnation in my  heart"
1378;GREATEST OF ALL MIRACLES;;"I wasn't there by the shores of Galilee
When Jesus touched those blinded eyes
and made them see
And though I did not see the empty tomb that day
I still believed, for I know what Jesus did for me.

I believe there is power in the blood of the Lamb
And I believe there is healing in the touch of His hand
But the greatest of all miracles was when Je --sus saved me
For I know what Jesus did for me

I have seen the lowest sin-sick soul
Have life anew and be made pure, pure and whole
And I have knelt and loosed the chains of sin
And set my spirit free
Yes, I know what Jesus did for me"
1379;SETTLE THE SCORE;;"Standing so tall Goliath looked down 
at little David standing his ground;
Thinking this boy is no match for me, 
surely there's more.
Not wielding a sword or holding a shild 
so why would he come to this battlefield
Then David cried: The Lords on my side,
 to settel the score.

Chorus
Settle the score, settle the score
everything satan has stolen, 
God can restore.
Now's not the time for doubt and deaspair
you can not loose when Jesus is there
Don't settle for less anymore, settle the Score!

Are you afraid, don't know what to do, 
outnumbered by forces that won't let you through?
Surrounded by fear, 
you've grown to weak to fight anymore.
I've got good news, listen my friend; 
God is on time and it's not the end
I know what He'll do, 
He'll fight for you and settle the score"
1380;THERE WAS JESUS;;"Every time I tried to make it on my own
Every time I tried to stand I start to fall
And all those lonely roads  that I have 
travelled on
There was Jesus

CHORUS
In the waiting, in the searching
 (there was Jesus)
In the healing in the hurting 
(there was Jesus)
Like a blessing buried in the broken pieces
Every minute, every moment 
(there was Jesus)
Where I've been and where I'm going
Even when I didn't know it or couldn't
see it
There was Jesus

When the life I built came crashing to 
the ground
When the friends I had were nowhere 
to be found
I couldn't see it then but I can 
see it now
There was Jesus

For this man who needs amazing 
kind of grace 
For forgiveness at a price I couldn't pay 
I'm not perfect so I thank God 
every day
There was Jesus 

On the mountain, in the valleys 
(There was Jesus)
In the shadows of the alleys 
(There was Jesus)
In the fire, in the flood 
(There was Jesus)"

mengi sana
Lakini tukiwa na yesu,Tutashinda

Chorus
Baada ya taabu zote, tulizo zipata

Tutapumzika milele,kwa baba
Katika yerusalemi, iliyo pambwa vizuri
Ndugu jitahidi, ili uwepo

Kwa nguvu zangu mwenyewe
Siwezi kufanya lolote
Kuiokoa nafsi yangu dhambini
Lakini nikimtazama yesu
Nitashinda kama yeye alivyoshinda
Kama yeye, alivyomshinda shetani."
1384;NOW I BELONG TO HIM;;"Like a babe when it cries 
for its mother
Like a child, I was helpless alone
Then I met the Master
Now I am one of His own

For all things were changed
When He found me
A new day broke through
All around me
For I met the Master
Now I belong to Him

Like a blind man who walks in 
the darkness
I had longed, I had searched for 
the light
Then I met the Master
No I walk no more in the night"
1385;I'M IN THIS CHURCH;;"I'm in this Church
This glorious Church
I didn't join, no, I was born,
I've had a new birth
Some glorious day gonna sail away
It's by His Grace, not by my works
I'm in this Church.

This glorious Church
I didn't join, no, I was born,
I've had a new birth
Some glorious day gonna sail away
It's by His Grace, not by my works
I'm in this Church

When Jesus came, He was left out
There was no place where He was 
welcome here on earth
But He had a plan for a house that 
forever will stand
He spoke these words ""Upon this 
rock I'll build my Church.""

I'm in this Church
This glorious Church
I didn't join, no, I was born,
I've had a new birth
Some glorious day gonna sail away
It's by His Grace, not by my works
I'm in this Church

Are you in the Church triumphant?
Are you in the Savior's Bride?
Come and be baptised into the body,
And forever more abide.

Have you been baptised into the body?
Baptised with the Holy Ghost?
There is but one way to enter in It,
Just as they did on Pentecost

Are you in the Church triumphant?
Are you in the Savior's Bride?
Come and be baptised into the body
And forever more abide

I'm in this Church
This glorious Church

1386;WHEN I MET THE MASTER;;"Like a babe when it cries for its mother
The broken heart, I was helpless alone,
Then I met the Master,
He changed,and He gave me a song.

Chorus
For all things were changed
When He found me
A new day broke through
All around me
For I met the Master
And now I am one of His own.

Like a blind man who walks in the darkness,
I had longed, I had searched for the light,
Then I met the Master,
Now I walk no more in the night."
1387;I HOLD A CLEAR TITLE TO A MANSION;;"I've heard people talk about heaven
and tell of its beauty so rare.
So one day I purchased a title to a
mansion in that land so fair.
It was given to me without money
it cost my dear Saviour his life.
He died on the cross without a murmur
For me he paid the dear price.

Chorus
I hold a clear title to a mansion
that Jesus has gone to prepare.
Fire cannot touch it, thieves cannot harm it,
and it never will need a repair.
The termites can't mar its foundation
for on the rock of ages it stands.
I feel it is almost completed and
ready for me to move in.

The deed was both signed and recorded
the day Jesus saved me from sin.
My name was engraved in gold letters
in the Lamb's book of life, safe within.
I'm an heir to that mansion in glory
when from this life here I'll go.
I'm waiting for Jesus to call me
and I'll lay down my cross and go home."
1388;THE CROSS IN THE MIDDLE;;"Now there is, no sign of, the crosses
But history, records, there were three
Two stood, because, of men's broken
 laws
But I know, the other, stood there for me
I didn't know Peter or Judas,
But I've known, the shame of, their
 crimes
I'm so glad Jesus did, die in my stead
The cross in the middle, 
should have been mine

CHORUS
I never heard the hammer
And I never felt the nails
I never saw the angry mob
Cursed as the prisoners fell
And they never knew this sinner
I was some other place and time
The choice was all His
But the truth was and is
The cross in the middle, 
should have been mine

I never deserved the mercy
Or merited, so much grace
This, unworthy man just can't understand
Why that man of no wrong took my 
rightful place
If you ever stopped at Calvary
The blood isn't all you will find
You'll feel it too,
You'll feel like I do
The cross in the middle, 
should have been mine"
1389;NO NOT ONE;;"There’s not a Friend like 
the lowly Jesus:
  No, not one! no, not one!
None else could heal all our 
souls’ diseases:
  No, not one! no, not one! 

CHORUS
Jesus knows all about our 
struggles;
  He will guide ’til the day is done:
There’s not a Friend like 
the lowly Jesus:
    No, not one! no, not one!

No friend like Him is so high 
and holy,
  No, not one! no, not one!
And yet no friend is so meek 
and lowly,
  No, not one! no, not one!

There’s not an hour that He is 
not near us,
  No, not one! no, not one!
No night so dark, but His love 
can cheer us,
  No, not one! no, not one!

Did ever saint find this Friend 
forsake him?
  No, not one! no, not one!
Or sinner find that He would 
not take him?
  No, not one! no, not one!

Was e’er a gift like the Savior 
given?
  No, not one! no, not one!
Will He refuse us the bliss 
of heaven?
  No, not one! no, not one!"
1390;THE BATTLE IS THE LORD'S;;"There is a source, in times of need
That gives me hope, that brings 
me peace
In every trial, through every test
My saviour stands in my defence

CHORUS
So when the road you walk,
Leaves you tired and worn,
All your strength is gone,
And your heart feels torn,
Remember God is greater than 
the storm
Take courage for the battles 
is the Lord's

And when the waters rise,
He calls my name, and bids me come
Out on the wave, He Holds my hand
Lest I should falter, and makes 
me stand
Upon the waters."

And the funny things you'd say

I see you most at Christmas

Somehow you left me too

And look into your eyes
And talk forever me and you
Somewhere in paradise

1400;Rock of Ages;;"CHORUS
Lay them down,
Lay them down
Just bring your burdens 
to the Rock of Ages 
and lay them all down.

When trouble surround on every side
And you can't find a safe place to run and hide
Just make your rightful claim to higher ground
And bring your burdens to the Rock of Ages 
and lay them all down

Rock of Ages cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee
Let the Water and Blood, 
from Thy riven side which flowed
Be for sin the double cure
Save from wrath and keep me pure.

Nothing in my hands I bring
Simply to Thy Cross I'll cling.
Naked, come to Thee for dress.
Helpless, come to Thee for grace.
Foul I to the Fountain fly, 
wash me Savior or I die.

Rock of ages cleft for me, 
let me hide myself in Thee.

Just bring your burdens to the Rock of Ages

1401;A VIEW FROM THE OTHER SIDE;;"The clouds got so dark
The cold winds of trials began to blow
I thought to myself, that alone I'd 
have to stand
When I saw one set of foot prints in 
the sand
But God's purpose I now see, in his arms 
he carries me 
I'm dying to my own way of thinking
I know I'll rise in victory 

CHORUS
Father not my will but thine be done
I want a view from the other side
So I can live this life through your eyes
You said all things works together for 
my good
I'm willing to trust you, to believe you
I'm laying down my all
Let thy will be done 2x

You have been my guide
Help me to follow you night and day
Teach me to trust you, Lord teach 
me to obey
Without you Lord I know I cannot find 
my way
So, let me never ever stray, close to 
you I'll always stay
No longer Leaning on my understanding
Father I submit to you

Now I've come to know 
You'd never leave me nor forsake me
I'm being led by Your divine hand 
Through this ordained pathway you 
have planned
And In your sufferings we now have 
sweet fellowship 
Now that you dwell in me
In your perfect will I always want to be"
1402;I HAVE BEEN BLESSED;;"When He moves among us all 
that He does
All of His mercy, and all of His love
If the pen of the writer could write 
everyday
Even this world could never contain
How much  i have been blessed
Warmth in the winter, flowers in spring
Laughter at summer, the changing 
of leaves
Food on my table and a good 
place to sleep
Clothes on my back and shoes on 
my feet
I have been blessed

CHORUS
I have been blessed, God's so 
good to me
Precious are His thoughts of you and me
No way could I count them, there's not

So I'll just thank Him for being so kind
God has been good, so good
I have been blessed

Arms that will raise, a voice that can talk
Hands that can touch, legs that can walk
Ears that can listen, eyes that can see
I've got to praise Him as long as I breathe
I have been blessed
A mother and father who nurtured 
and raised
Sisters and brother, memories made
Our pastor to lead us this altar to pray
Stripes that can heal the blood that still 
saves
I have been blessed

He's my shoulder to lean on when I am down
The rock where He leads me when I'm 
overwhelmed
The place where He hides me under His 
wings
He's not just a song, He's the reason I sing
I have been blessed"
1403;GOING YONDER;;"I hear a sound coming from a distant city
Its calling me to spread my wings for a flight
And with great triumphant shouting i'll be leaving

And i'm going yonder, way over yonder
Its a place of wondrous beauty not made by man
A holy city, God's holy city
Yes I'm headed for God's promised land

We will lift our voices and sing a brand new song
no goodbyes will be spoken in that country
For all the saints will be gathered
Around God's great white throne"
1404;SEARCH ME, OH GOD;;"Search me, O God, my actions try,
 And let my life appear
As seen by Thine all-searching eye
To mine my ways make clear.

Search all my sense, and know my heart
Who only canst make known,
And let the deep, the hidden part
To me be fully shown.

Throw light into the darkened cells,
Where passion reigns within;
Quicken my conscience till it feels
The loathsomeness of sin.

Search all my thoughts, the secret springs,
The motives that control;
The chambers where polluted things
 Hold empire o’er the soul.

Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast
Its holy light through all,
And I by grace am brought at last
Before Thy face to fall.

Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee,
 What now I feebly prove,
That God alone in Christ can be
 Unutterable love."

1406;BROKEN PIECES;;"Once a woman in The Bible was 
condemmed by man to die
She was nothing more than an outcast 
her friends passed her by
With stones they sought to kill her but Jesus 
showed her love so true
He took the broken pieces of her life 
and made it new.

Chorus
He won't throw you away, 
He still using broken things
Though you may feel so worthless, 
he'll love you just the same
To Jesus it doesn't matter, what sin 
has caused you to do
He'll take the broken pieces of your 
life and make it new.

My life was torn and shattered like 
glass upon the floor
Through the many deeds I'd done I had 
nothing to live for
When all had forsaken me and I didn't 
know what to do
That's when he took the broken pieces 
of my life and made it new"

Bowing here, I find my rest

CHORUS
Lord, I need You, oh I need You
Every hour, I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
And where You are, Lord I am free
Holiness is Christ in me

So teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on You
Jesus, You're my hope and stay"
1408;HOLD ON MY CHILD;;"If you've knelt beside the rubble 
of an aching broken heart
When the things you gave your life 
to fell apart
You're not the first to be acquainted 
with sorrow, grief or pain
But the master promised sunshine after rain

CHORUS
Hold on my child,
Joy comes in the morning.
Weeping only lasts 
For the night.
Hold on my child,
Joy comes in the morning,
The darkest hour
Means dawn is just in sight.

To invest your seeds of trust in God 
in mountains you can't move
You have risked your life 
on things you cannot prove
But to give the things you cannot keep 
for what you cannot lose
Now, that's the way to find 
the joy God has for you"

1411;LIFE STORY;;"It was 1909 in a lonely log cabin
Where a baby was born with a 
sign over him,
The pillar of fire came down that 
day and whirled 
into the window in the room where he lay
As he grew a little older his 
parents told him
About a mysterious light that came in

Alone and forsaken by friends
and by men
Till an angel came down so he 
would understand 
He was God's chosen man

One day he was resting beneath 
an old old tree
When he noticed a whirlwind rustling 
the leaves
He thought nothing strange but when 
he started to go,
A big voice came forth and here's 
what he spoke
""DON'T DRINK, DON'T SMOKE, 
DEFILE YOUR 
BODY IN ANY WAY, I'VE GOT A 
WORK FOR YOU 
LATER I'LL SHOW YOU SOMEDAY""

At the age of 7 God showed him a 
vision about a 
bridge being built, later on was fulfilled,
On the Ohio river where that bridge 
now stands,
Is where the mysterious light came 
down again, as he baptised the 17th 
person that day, thousands were there
 to witness that day

Now the story I told you I know 
there is more, he was the fulfillment 
of Malachi 4
Now if there's a doubt In your mind 
what you've heard,
Don't take it from me, check it out 
with the word,
With an open heart God will show 
that its plain, that WILLIAM BRANHAM 
is this man's name."

Anipa yote yanifaayo kwa roho

CHORUS
Shape me, dear father, please 
make me like you.
Mold me completely so I can be true.
If you have to break me, may I 
understand
You're still loving and molding 
my life in your hands.

It would be such disservice, 
results would be nil
If clay rejects potter, and it seeks its 
own will.
It could only be cast out, to the 
old potter's mill.
Please don't cast me out Master, 
put me back on your wheel."

Then again we?re sinking low
In the shadow of a mountain
Looming high above our head
We need not fear what lies ahead
For the word has clearly said
That our faith would be sufficient
To make the mountain disappear
And the mountain must move

CHORUS
Speak to the mountain
You'll not triumph over me
Be thou removed from here to yonder
Disappear into the sea
Speak to the mountain
Speak with authority
And the mountain must move
And you shall claim victory

In the midst of the battle
When the foe is gaining ground
Just look up and see
The mighty hand of God reaching down
Speak God?s name and satan trembles
Speak God's word and watch him flee
Once again our God delivers
The mountain crumbles at our feet

And the mountain must move
And you shall claim victory"

And one night as she layed quietly, 
The Spirit of the Lord overshadowed her.
And said that you'll conceive a child,
That sin cannot defile and she said,
"" Be it unto me according to thy Word""

And she kept these things,
And pondered them deep within her heart.
She believed in God when He said that 
something new was going to start. 
Now if this Word could be formed in Mary,
Then I believe it can be born in you 
and me.

Now we're the virgin bride to be,
Saved through the blood of Calvary, 
And in this time of darkness we have 
come.
Received the vindicated Word,
That we all have heard
And I can see it being born 
In you and me.

Because we've kept these things,
And pondered them deep within our hearts. 
We've stayed with this Word,
Never, one time felt desire to depart.
Now if this Word could be formed in Mary, 
Then I believe it can be born in you

I found no peace in anything 
that I tried,
But I saw my life quickly end,
and a brand new one begin,
the day I found the place where 
Jesus died.

CHORUS
And Because of Calvary,
I'll Never Be the Same Again,
I found the joy I never thought could 
ever be.
He took a life shattered with sin,
Put it together once again
And oh what a change there's been

Because of Calvary
When my heart is sad and growing 
weary
I journey in my mind back to Calvary.
And I kneel beneath its flow that 
washes white as snow
And I find new strength awaiting 
there for me"
1431;I WILL BE STILL;;"Hide me now
Under Your wings
Cover me
Within Your mighty hand

CHORUS
When the oceans rise and 
thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, you are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God

Find rest, my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust

Bridge:
Be still and know that
I am God

Bridge:
I am the Lord 
that healeth thee"
1432;LET'S HAVE A REVIVAL;;"CHORUS
Let's have a revival from the pulpit 
to the pew
Let's have a revival that starts with 
me and you
That reaches out to the lost and 
hungry world
To bring them in
This is our joy, it's our survival
Let's pray for a Holy Ghost arrival
Let's have a revival

Sometimes we've just go through 
the motions,
Left the spirit out, no power in our program,
No victory in our shout,
God will give us back the joy, let's open 
up the bible,
Lay aside formality, let's have a revival

I asked the old time preacher
How revival came back there
He said he always started
Down on his knees in prayer
Just open up the two books
The songbook and the Bible
If you'll sing and preach God's Word
You'll have a revival"
1433;JOY UNSPEAKABLE;;"I have found His grace is all complete;
He supplieth every need.
While I sit and learn at Jesus’ feet,
I am free, yes, free indeed.

CHORUS
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory.
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory;
O the half has never yet been told!

I have found the pleasure I once craved;
It is joy and peace within.
What a wondrous blessing! I am saved
From the awful gulf of sin. 

I have found that hope so bright and clear,
Living in the realm of grace.
O the Savior’s presence is so near;
I can see His smiling face.

I have found the joy no tongue can tell,
How its waves of glory roll!
It is like a great o’erflowing well,
Springing up within my soul"
1434;HE BECAME ME;;"He became me,
so that I might become Him by Grace.
He became me,
so that I might become Him by Grace.
He took my place,
so that I, by His love could take His.
He became me,
so that I might become Him by Grace."
1435;YOUR NAME IS JESUS;;"How many names
Can I use to explain
The love of my Jesus
The life that He gave
And so many times
Will I praise You today
I lift up my life
Cause You're always the same
And my offering
To you I bring

CHORUS
Your name is Jesus
Your name is Jesus
You're the wonderful, counselor, 
my friend
You're what I hold on to
I know that You brought me through
All the days of loss and to the cross, 
You knew That I'd need a Savior

How many songs
Can I sing to proclaim
Your wondrous love
Oh and beauty so great
Oh and, What would I say
If You brought down the rain
And everyday I walked through the pain
My heart would still say
All the days of loss, and to the 
cross You knew

That I'd Need a Savior Well, 
I'd need a Savior....
You're what I hold onto, 
I know that You brought me through
All the days of loss and to the cross 
You knew
That I'd need a Savior
I'd need a Savior
I need You Savior"
1437;HE CALMS ME;;"Troubled waters came my way,
the angry storms grew near,
I prayed for God to speak 
the words to make it disappear, 
It seemed the waves would not obey 
the master's call for peace
But then the Lord spoke to my soul 
reminded me He had control
And said this time his words were meant for me

Chorus
Sometimes He calms the storm,
Sometimes He calms me
Sometimes the storm still rages on 
but I feel the sweet peace,
it's a such a joy to know 
that my Lord knows just what I need
Sometimes He calms the storm 
Sometimes He calms me

Circumstance may overtake 
and bring me to my knees
But  when I feel I cannot cope 
with this life's troubled sea
I call on Him whose voice can still 
much greater storms than this
His words bring peace into my soul  
when He says ""child I'm in control""
And with one touch He can calm the storm in me"
1438;LIVING HOPE;;"How great the chasm that lay 
between us
How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke your name into the night
Then through the darkness
Your loving kindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul
The work is finished, the end is written
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Who could imagine so great a mercy?
What heart could fathom such boundless 
grace?
The God of ages stepped down 
from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
The king of kings calls me His own
Beautiful savior, I'm yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Then came the morning that sealed the 
promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the roaring lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me

Then came the morning that sealed the 
promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the roaring lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me
Jesus, yours is the victory.

Hallelujah, praise the one who set 
me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Hallelujah, praise the one who set 
me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Oh God, you are my living hope"
1439;SET YOUR WINGS TO THE WINDS OF FAITH;;"There are two roads 
you may take
One by sight, one by faith
Take the Word of 
God or what you see,
What you believe 
is what will be.

Chorus
Set your wings to 
the winds of faith
You can fly in a 
higher place.
Do not struggle, 
it's by grace.
Set your wings to 
the winds of faith

What's your need, 
what's your cry,
What's your mountain 
much too high.
Speak the Word of 
God, and by and by,
It will move or you will fly.

Watch the eagle in the sky,
He does not struggle, 
he does not strive.
For the power that 
makes him rise,
is already in the sky."
1440;ONLY A PRAYER AWAY;;"One day I heard the ancient story
Of a cross on a hill far away
And now I've a friend up in glory
And He’s only a prayer away

Chorus
O He never would say: 'I'm too busy today’
Every tear, every care, He's promised He will share
And although He's the Lord of all glory
Yet He's only a prayer away

Sometimes I don't feel much like praying
But He speaks words of love just the same
And deep in my soul there starts flowing
Living waters, songs of praise to His name

If I keep the cross e’er before me
As I die I will live day by day
If I sin, If I fall, He'll restore me
For He's only a prayer away"
1441;THE SAME GOD;;"I look back on history,
See the mighty God unveiled,
Proving over and over
That His Word can never fail;
But I can't keep on dwelling
On some past memory,
'Cause He's the same God
who's living in me.

CHORUS
The same God who spoke to
the woman at the well,
The same God whose wonders
too many to tell;
The same God who parted
the raging, red sea,
He's the same God
who's living in me.

The same God who created
all the Heavens and all the earth,
Who came back living in Jesus,
And there was power in His Word;
But now in these last days,
I'm beginning to see,
That it's that same God
who's living in me."
1442;I CAN TRUST JESUS;;"God picked up a sparrow
That could no longer fly
He brushed off his wounds
And then watched it soar into the sky
If He's mindful of creation
On this I can depend
I am His child
And I can place all my trust in Him

CHORUS
I can trust Jesus
I can trust Jesus
He never once has failed
To meet my needs
He is my strong tow'r
The strength in my weakest hour
I can trust Jesus
He takes care of me

I have prayed some prayers
And felt they never were heard
But I held to God's hand
And kept right on trusting in His words
My wants and God's desires
Don't always agree
But I lean on His will
For He always know what's best for me

He is my strong tow'r
The strength in my weakest hour
I can trust Jesus
He takes care of me
I can trust Jesus
He takes care of me"
1443;ON THE CROSS CRUCIFIED;;"On the Cross crucified
In great sorrow my Saviour died
Oh the Giver of so much life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised and rejected of men
Oh this Jesus of Calvary

CHORUS
He was wounded for our transgression
He was bruised for our iniquities
Surely he bore our sorrows
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid,
As those cruel stripes were made,
With-in Pilate's judgement hall,
Now his suff-'ring afford perfect healing
For all, this wonderful healer's mine

Came the leper that day to Christ
Saying surely I know
That Thou, Lord can make me whole
And when his great faith was seen, Jesus 
said ""Yes, I will.""
Touched him and made him clean.

He has healed my sick soul, made 
me ev-'ry whit whole,
and he'll do the same for you, 
He's the same yesterday and today 
and for aye, this healer of men to-day."
1444;TIRED TRAMPING;;"There's a deep and inward hunger
Within my soul.
God has promised in His Word,
He'll make us whole.
Well it's time for it to happen,
That huge portion of heaven;
It will make and bring to pass,
That tremendous victory in the
love divine

CHORUS
For I'm tired of tramping on this
mountain,
I'm heading down to the Jordan,
Lo, before me I see a vision
breaking,
A Power that would bind that
mamba,
The third pull ministry

Now's my time for consecration,
I must see a change in me,
I will enter my secret closet,
And close the door behind me.
I'll keep the feast of Unleavened
Bread
With truth and sincerity,
For I'm expecting Jehovah-Jireh,
My Lord, to meet with me

Lord, keep Thy Holy fire burning
Deep in my soul,
Change me from glory unto glory,
Till Thy image You behold.
Let's keep this Holy convocation,
Till we become a new creation,
For it's the message in you and me
Will bring to pass that tremendous
victory"
1445;MY EYES ARE DRY;;"My eyes are dry
My faith is old
My heart is hard
My prayers are cold
And I know how I ought to be
Alive to You and dead to me

But what can be done
For an old heart like mine
Soften it up
With oil and wine
The oil is You, Your Spirit of love
Please wash me anew
With the wine of Your Blood"
1446;HOLY OF HOLIES;;"Like Aaron's rod 
I lay dead in the outer court
Where the light would shine from the sun 
and the moon
At times a cloud would come and cover 
It grew so dark everywhere
I desired for a glory that would last

But in the Holy place
We had the light from the candlesticks
At times the wind would blow 
And it grew smoky once again 
Like a leaf in the wind 
I was so easily tossed about 
I desired for a hidden life in Christ

But in the Holy place
We had the light from the candlesticks
At times the wind would blow 
And it grew smoky once again 
Like a leaf in the wind 
I was so easily tossed about 
I desired for a hidden life in Christ

In the Holy of holies
In the Presence of the LORD
Under the Shekinah Glory
Where the light never goes off
Aaron's rod that was old 
Bloomed with life and bore fruits 
Here the manna would last 
And would never go bad 
In the presence of the Lord


In the Holy of holies
In the Presence of the LORD
Under the Shekinah Glory
Where the light never goes off
Here I am shut in with God
And the world is locked outside
I will never be tossed 
For I'm anchored in Christ
In the Presence of the LORD

In the Holy of holies
In the Presence of the LORD
Under the Shekinah Glory
Where the light never goes off
Here I am shut in with God
And the world is locked outside
I will never be tossed 
For I'm anchored in Christ
In the Presence of the LORD

I will never be tossed 
For I'm anchored in Christ
In the Presence of the LORD"
1447;I CLAIM THE BLOOD;;"I have a source of strength when i am weak
That takes me through when life is pressing me
I have a source of power from above
I'm covered over by a shield of love

CHORUS
I claim the blood
Jesus shed on calvary
Those precious bloodstains
Were made there just for me
For all my sin, my sickness and my pain
When i need healing
I claim those precious bloodstains

I do not know how others make it through
Who never go to calvary as i do
For there a healing cleansing stream still flows
With peace that only his redeemed can know

For all my sin, my sickness and my pain
When I need healing
I claim those precious blood----stains"
1448;I LOVE LIVING IN LOVE WITH HIM;;"There's a love song rising up inside me.
These feelings in my heart must be released.
I feel so alive, I just can't help but sing
About the One who makes my heart beat.

Chorus
I love living in love with Jesus.
I love knowing that He loves me.
He makes the sun shine in my heart
When the way is dim.
Oh, how I love living in love with Him! 

His Presence is a treasure this world can't afford.
Each day with Him is sweeter than before.
He satisfies me, yet He makes me long for more
Even in the sunshine and the storm.

When the way is dim
Oh, how I love living in love
Oh, how I love living in love
Oh, how I love living in love with Him."
1449;COME HERE BY LORD;;"Come by here Lord, come by here

1450;YOU ARE STILL GOD;;"I thought, that it would happen to 
anyone but me
I never dreamed that I would carry, this 
heavy burden on my knees
I never thought that I'd be standing 
just where I stand today
I've never known this kind of heart break
I've never felt this kind of pain

Chorus
You're still God when my eyes have 
cried a million tears
You're still God when my last hope has 
disappeared
You're still God and I know you'll make 
a way somehow
You're still God and you're holding 
me right now

My heart, cant find the answers, to 
the reason for this trial
But Lord I know your ways are perfect 
And You've been watching all the while
for to me, You've proven so faithful Jesus, 
time and time again and I'm learning 
Lord to trust You
even when I dont, understand"

your name Jehovah, my Helper
There is something that makes me come in
to your presence, my Helper"
1452;SAFE IN THE ARMS;;"Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast;
There by His love o'ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.
Hark! 'tis the voice of angels
Borne in a song to me,
Over the fields of glory,
Over the jasper sea.

Chorus
Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast;
There by His love o'ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.

Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe from corroding care,
Safe from the world's temptations;
Sin cannot harm me there.
Free from the blight of sorrow,
Free from my doubts and fears;
Only a few more trials,
Only a few more tears!

Jesus, my heart's dear Refuge,
Jesus has died for me;
Firm on the Rock of Ages
Ever my trust shall be.
Here let me wait with patience,
Wait till the night is o'er;
Wait till I see the morning
Break on the golden shore."
1453;BACK TO THE BLESSED OLD BIBLE;;"Back to the blessed old Bible,
Back to the city of God;
Back to the oneness of heaven,
Back where the faithful have trod.
Back from the land of confusion,
Passing the wrecks and the creeds;
Back to the light of the morning,
Jesus our Captain leads.

CHORUS
Back to the blessed old Bible,
Back to the light of its word;
Be on our banners forever:
Holiness unto the Lord.

Back to the blessed old Bible,
Saints of Jehovah, rejoice;
Jesus is calling His people
Back to the land of their choice.
Often our fathers have sought it
While we in Babel abode,
Now we have found the fair city
Church of the living God.

Back to the blessed old Bible,
Leaving confusion and strife;
Fleeing from Babel to Zion,
Back to the joy of our life.
Over the mountains we wandered,
Looking in vain for the right;
Now in the evening we’ve found it:
Truth of the gospel light.

Back to the blessed old Bible,
Back at the Master’s call,
Back to the words of our Savior,
Loving, obeying them all.
Never in sects to be scattered,
Never again to do wrong;
Unity, holiness, heaven,
Ever shall be our song."
1454;CAST THY BREAD UPON THE WATER;;"Cast thy bread upon the water,
’Twill return in many days;
Crumbs of truth for Jesus scatter,
All along thy pilgrim ways.

CHORUS
Cast thy bread upon the water,
It will soon return again;
Cast thy bread upon the water,
Jesus says ’tis not in vain.

Cast thy bread upon the water,
Christ will watch the rolling wave,
As it ripples slowly onward,
To the soul He seeks to save.

Cast thy bread upon the water,
Let it spread from pole to pole;
And the prayers of patient toilers
Soon will yield some precious soul.

Cast thy bread upon the water,
Trusting it is not in vain,
For the lost and wand’ring sinner
May be gathered back again."
1455;YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN;;"That heavenly Teacher, in words that are plain,
This truth declared to men,
If ever they would to His kingdom attain,
They must be born again.

CHORUS
Ye must be born again,
Ye must be born again;
His words are true, He speaks to you,
Ye must be born again.

No mere reformation your sins can erase,
You cannot remove their stain;
If ever in heaven your soul has a place,
Ye must be born again.

Good works will not answer, no penance will do,
Morality, too, is vain,
For naught will avail but a creature made new,
Ye must be born again.

In Adam we lost all our righteous estate,
And would we it regain,
To Jesus must come and repent ere too late
Ye must be born again."
1456;GIVE ME JESUS ALONE;;"I am here a pilgrim stranger,
Give me Jesus alone;
He will guard my soul from danger,
Give me Jesus alone.

Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
Till I reach my home in glory
Give me Jesus alone.
When the pow’rs of sin beset me,
Give me Jesus alone;
When my friends on earth forget me,
Give me Jesus alone.

Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
Every hour and every moment,
Give me Jesus alone.
Though the world its praise should offer,
Give me Jesus alone;
With my Lord I’ll meekly suffer,
Give me Jesus alone.

Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
Let the world deride or flatter,
Give me Jesus alone.
When my heart for joy is singing,
Give me Jesus alone;
Or when pain my heart is wringing,
Give me Jesus alone.

Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
In the sunshine or the shadow,
Give me Jesus alone.
Passing through life’s verdant meadow,
Give me Jesus alone;
Or through death’s dark gloomy shadow,
Give me Jesus alone.

Give me Jesus alone,
Give me Jesus alone;
Whether life or death await me,
Give me Jesus alone."

Start the everlasting song:
Victory, victory."

Let them come alive
If we know Him as He is
There is peace in Christ

Chorus
He gives us hope
When hope is gone
He give us strength
When we can't go on
He give us shelter
In the storms of life
When there's no peace on Earth
There is peace in Christ

When we walk with him
Through the streets of Galilee to 
Jerusalem
Mend the broken hearts
Dry the tear-filled eyes
When we live the way He lives
There is peace in Christ"

1465;IT SATISFIES ME;;"In the garden of Gethsemane, 
I can see our Savior there
As He talked to His Father in earnest 
prayer
He said ""If it be thy will, let this 
cup pass from me
But if not Lord, then it satisfies me

Chorus
If it satisfies you Lord, then it satisfies me
These few words may my prayer ever be
If you'd have me on a mountain or in a 
valley on my knees
Either way Lord, it satisfies me

Now the signs of the times, they're on 
every hand
How my heart longs to see the promised 
land
If I go by the grave or in the rapture 
your face I see
Either way Lord, it satisfies me."
1466;IS ANYTHING TOO HARD FOR GOD;C;"It's out of your hands, you've done all

standing on God's truth
While you're waiting on the answer He has a 
question for you

Chorus
Is anything too hard for God
Who's got a problem beyond His 
pow'r to solve
Are there situations He's not the 
master of
Is anything too hard for God

His plans are now unfolding, performing 
perfectly
It's clear how much He loves you, look at 
all He's done
For all your questions there is really only One"

1469;THE SECRET PLACE;;"My heart is like a house
One day I let the Savior in
There are many rooms
Where we would visit now and then

But then one day He saw that door
I knew the day had come too soon
I said, ""Jesus, I'm not ready
For us to visit in that room

'Coz that's a place in my heart
Where even I don't go
I have some things hidden there
I don't want no one to know""

But He handed me the key
With tears of love on His face
He said, ""I want to make you clean
Let me go in your secret place.""

So I opened up the door
And as the two of us walked in
I was so ashamed
His light revealed my hidden sin

But when I think about that room now
I'm not afraid any more
'Cuz I know my hidden sin
No longer hides behind that door

That was a place in my heart
Where even I wouldn't go
I had some things hidden there
I didn't want no one to know

But He handed me the key
With tears of love on His face
And He made me clean
I let Him in my secret place
Is there a place in your heart
Where even you won't go"
1470;I BELIEVE JESUS SAVES;;"In this age of confusion
There's dissolution every where
It's hard to find true peace of mind
Or someone who really cares
I have put my trust in Jesus
He's like no other man I know
His word is true
He will see me through
I believe Jesus

CHORUS
I believe, Jesus saves
I believe a crown of life awaits beyond
the grave
I believe the path the saints have trod
That a prayer can touch the heart of God
I believe the old time ways
I believe Jesus

Though this world has refused Him
Though we abuse Him, He still lives
His grief and pain were for our gain
So that our Lord might freely give
Faith to overcome each trial
The grace to live in victory
His nail scared hands wrote salvation's 
plan
I believe Jesus"

1472;HE GIVETH MORE GRACE;;"CHORUS
His love has no limits, His grace 
has no measure,
His power has no boundary known 
unto men;
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus
He giveth, and giveth, and giveth 
again.

He giveth more grace as our 
burdens grow greater,
He sendeth more strength as our 
labors increase;
To added afflictions He addeth His 
mercy,
To multiplied trials He multiplies peace.

When we have exhausted our store 
of endurance,
When our strength has failed ere the 
day is half done,
When we reach the end of our hoarded
 resources
Our Father's full giving is only begun."
1473;CHANCES ARE YOU'LL FIND ME;;"Meet me by the river, or maybe

the Saviour's Feet.

CHORUS
Chances are you'll find me at 
the Saviour's feet
For that's where I'll be most of the day
I may be in my mansion or by 
the Crystal Sea
But Chances are you'll find me at 
the Saviour's feet


Jesus came from Heaven oh what 
a sacrifice
We were lost and without hope for us He
 paid the price
So when I reach that city I'll kneel before 
the Throne
Chances are you'll find me and I won't be 
alone"
1474;THE CHALLENGE;;"It’s a challenge to accept,

test.



CHORUS
For I’ve got to prove

blood;
I’ve got to prove I’m not like
those
from Satan’s Eden,
I’ve got to show that I’m a person
that this world isn’t worthy off.



True representative of Christ,
In the field that you’ve been
placed,
The joy of your life with Him,
Always a glowing on your face;
Living humbly, following the ways
He showed,
A true witness, of Christ in this day.



We are the ones that’s going to
stand,
And keep a testimony clean?
In the midst of this unbelieving world,
We’ll keep looking to the unseen;
To really know that we will
overcome,
And receive His promise to sit on
His throne"

All of His mercy, all of His love

Laughter at summer, the changing of leaves
Food on my table and a good place to sleep
Clothes on my back and shoes on my feet
I have been blessed

Chorus
I have been blessed, God's so good to me
Precious are His thoughts of you and me
No way I could count them, there's not enough time
So I'll just thank Him for being so kind
God has been good, so good
I have been blessed


Arms that will raise, a voice that can talk
Hands that can touch, legs that can walk
Ears that can listen, eyes that can see
I've got to praise Him as long as I breathe
I have been blessed


A mother and father who nurtured and raised
Sisters and brothers, memories made
A pastor to lead us, this altar to pray
Stripes that can heal, the blood that still saves
I have been blessed


He's my shoulder to lean on when I am down
The rock where He leads me when I'm overwhelmed
The place where He hides me under His wings
He's not just a song, He's the reason I sing
I have been blessed"

Your most awesome work was done
Through the frailty of Your son"

The morning breaks at last,
And hushed the dreadful wail

As o’er the golden hills
The day advances fast!

With healing in His wings,
To every captive soul,
A full deliverance brings;
And thro’ the vacant cells,
The song of triumph rings;
The Comforter has come!

How shall this tongue of mine
To wondering mortals tell,
The matchless grace divine;
That I, a child of hell,
Should in His image shine!
The Comforter has come!"

1481;HE WILL REMEMBER ME;;"When on the cross of Calv’ry
The Lord was crucified;
The mob stood ’round about Him
And mocked until He died.
Two thieves were nailed beside Him
To share the agony,
But one of them cried out to Him,
""O Lord, remember me.”

CHORUS
Will the Lord remember me
When I am called to go?
When I have crossed death’s chilly sea,
will He His love there show?
O yes, He heard my feeble cries,
from bondage set me free.
And when I reach the pearly gates
He will remember me.

 Oh, what a shame to kill Him
There on that rugged cross;
But such a death was needed
To rescue all the lost.
His blood was made a ransom
To set the captives free;
I know that I’m included,
and He will remember me.

At His dear feet I’m kneeling.
My sins I now confess;
I bow in deep repentance,
My soul He’ll surely bless.
My blinded eyes He opens
So that the light I see,
And when I reach the pearly gates,
He will remember me."

1493;DO YOU KNOW THE SAVIOUR;;"He's more than a story
More than a song
His love is gentle
Yet it's so strong
His grace is everlasting
Just won't let you go

A fountain of hope

That we introduce you
Both now and forever
He's faithful and true
His name is Jesus
He died to give you life a new
Do you know the Saviour
Oh, how He loves you

He pardons the debtor
With nothing to pay
He offers forgiveness
To those who gone astray
He stands there waiting
At the door of your heart
And the moment you open
His peace He'll impart

There is a thirst in me, to know you more,

Where in lives, the real me, inside of me

1497;I LONG TO SEE JESUS;;"I've heard that all the streets are gold
There are pretty sights to see
I've heard about great riches untold
Awaiting me in glory
And yes I'd love to see these things
But most importantly
I long to see the One who died
for me

CHORUS
I long to see Jesus, Jesus
The one who gives me strength
and courage
To keep pressing on
Jesus, the One who loved me
When I did not deserve to be loved
Jesus means the most to me

Wars and strife on every hand
Disasters everywhere
People living in misery
Men's hearts fail for fear
And yet in this confusion
I have a settled peace
Because Jesus said He's coming back
He's coming back for me
And every day I'm longing
Just to look upon the face
Of the One who gave His life for me
And saved me by His grace.

Now every day I'm walking
With the consciousness of mind
That any day I'll be caught away
In the twinkling of an eye
I can feel my Saviour
He is coming so close
Administering and entrance
Into a parallel universe
He's decrypting the secrets
To immortality
Lifting me up from this earthly realm
Into the realm of the heavenly

Soon I will see Jesus, Jesus
The one who gives me strength
and courage
To keep pressing on
Jesus, the One who loved me
When I did not deserve to be loved
Jesus means the most to, to me...
He means the most....
His face I long to see...
My king theophany....Oh..
Jesus means the most to me"

To serve the Lord in my day;

Than to walk in His provided way.

It is the only thing that always shall

I'm finding myself in the midst of You
Beyond the music, beyond the noise
All that I need is to be with You
And in the quiet hear Your voice

To be still and know
That You're in this place

Oh lord I give you thanks

I thank you lord for the strength you give
To carry on, thru life's toils and tests
In the worst and best I'm not ever

1501;THANK YOU FOR THE STORM;;"It's a blessing when I see the dark clouds parting
When the rain is gone and sun is breaking through
I anticipate when life will just be normal
Just to close my weary eyes and rest in You
My heart can rest so easy when there's blue skies
When the wind is gone and rain is not in sight
How I long to hang my sword above the mantle
Away from harm and distant from the fight

But I wouldn't know Your peace without the 
hard times
Or be thankful for relief without the pain
I wouldn't love the light if it were not for the darkness
Or appreciate the sun without the rain
How could I understand forgiveness without failure
Or feel the warmth of love without the bitter cold

How could I hold Your healing hands 
without affliction
And be blessed to see Your mercies all unfold
Sure, it's a blessing to be safe, secure, and warm
But Lord, I want to thank You for the storm


Imagine as Peter sat in prison
He may have paced the floors with chains around
 his feet
And in his mind the devil taunt it as he whispers
""The battle's lost and this is your defeat""
But then his mind went back to that night in the tempest
When the Master spoke and winds and seas obeyed
And he remembered that storm calming all around him
He can rest in that dark prison unafraid
And say


But I wouldn't know Your peace without the 
hard times
Or be thankful for relief without the pain
I wouldn't love the light if it were not for the darkness
Or appreciate the sun without the rain
How could I understand forgiveness without failure
Or feel the warmth of love without the bitter cold

How could I hold Your healing hands 
without affliction
And be blessed to see Your mercies all unfold
Sure, it's a blessing to be safe, secure, and warm
But Lord, I want to thank You for the storm

BRIDGE 
If my life were free of trials
Lord, I'd loose my view of You
There's sweet trophies that remind me of 
all You do
Sure, it's a blessing to be safe, secure, and warm
But Lord, I want to thank You for the storm

I'm still safe, secure, and warm
And Lord, I want to thank You for the storm"
1502;Why Did I Walk Through The Valley?;;"Why did I walk through the valley?
Why was I forced to my knees?
Why did the sun parch and dry me?
When I walked through the desert of defeat
Then came the clouds and the rain fell
I thought Id never make it through the night
God gave me the answer when I prayed in tears
He let me see the dark, before the light

CHORUS
I can kneel with a brother
Who is bearing the burden
And I say I know just what youre going through
I can pray with a sister, in the midst of her sorrow
And I say I know because I've been there too
I can put my arms around someone who is down
Tell them to have faith and confidence
What in pain I could not see I now fully believe
God prepared me for such a time, as this

You may be praying for rescue
You are facing temptations and trials
Struggles are endlessly present
But the purpose is somewhere in Gods time
Gods time
Just keep on walking the good road
The night leads to a stronger wiser day
And when you ask the reason for the path you have trod
Youll know without a doubt and you can say"

And turn us from the way

you leave today?
Are you ready to lay down your worldly

Would it take a month of Sundays just 
to tell Him of your sin?

If the sky turns black as midnight in the

would soon be on His way
Would you have to beg forgiveness?
Or could you reach out and take His hand?
If Jesus comes tomorrow what then?"

Now his suff-'ring afford perfect healing

Flowing from the grace
That I've found in You
Lord I've come to know
The weaknesses I see in me
Will be stripped away
By the power of Your love

Hold me close
Let Your love surround me
Bring me near
Draw me to Your side
And as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your love

Lord unveil my eyes
Let me see You face to face
The knowledge of Your love
As You live in me
Lord renew my mind
As Your will unfolds in my life
In living every day
By the power of Your love

Hold me close
Let Your love surround me
Bring me near
Draw me to Your side
And as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your love

Hold me close
Let Your love surround me
Bring me near
Draw me to Your side
And as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your love

And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your love

And I will soar with You
Your Spirit leads me on
In the power of Your love"
1518;JESUS AT A DISTANCE;;"I been keepin' Jesus at a distance
So afraid to let Him get too close
To the two lives I've been livin'
As if He couldn't see them both
Close enough to feel the warmth of the fire
Far enough away for me to hide
But I'm tired of walkin' the wire
Between the darkness and the light

No more Jesus at a distance
No more pushin' You away
I don't wanna settle for the back row
Of some Sunday mornin' faith
So, I'm holdin' nothin' back now
'Cause there' nothin' You don't see
No more Jesus at a distance
Come change every part of me
Every part of me (ooh, ooh)

I was offered resurrection
But I settled for the grave
I had the chance to walk on water
But I chose to play it safe
I've been hiding from the Healer
I thought my wounds were out of reach
But at the end of all my runnin'
You're still runnin' after me

So, no more Jesus at a distance
No more pushin' You away
I don't wanna settle for the back row
Of some Sunday mornin' faith
So, I'm holdin' nothin' back now
'Cause there' nothin' You don't see
No more Jesus at a distance
Come change every part of me
Every part of me (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

All my dreams and all my treasures
(Every part of me, every part of me)
When I can barely hold it together
(Every part of me, every part of me)
When I can't control where tomorrow's goin'
(Every part of me, every part of me)

When the ghost of my yesterday's
 come callin'
(Every part of me, every part of me)
Who I am when there's no one else around
(Every part of me, every part of me)
When the sun comes up 'til the sun 
goes down
(Every part of me, every part of me)

So, no more Jesus at a distance
No more pushin' You away
I don't wanna settle for the back row 
Of some Sunday mornin' faith
So, I'm holdin' nothin' back now
'Cause there' nothin' You don't see
No more Jesus at a distance
Come change every part of me
Every part of me, every part of me 
(every part of me) Every part of me

So, no more Jesus at a distance
No more pushin' You away
I don't wanna settle for the back row 
Of some Sunday mornin' faith
So, I'm holdin' nothin' back now
'Cause there' nothin' You don't see
No more Jesus at a distance
Come change every part of me"
1519;WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE;;"Where do I go from here?
What fate is drawing near?
Touch my heart
And guide my lips in prayer.

Through the grace of God alone
I'll cast aside these fears I've known
And lift myself from
The depths of deep dispair.

Lead me through the darkness
And through each gloomy day.
Take my hand, oh, precious Lord
And help me on my way.

Give me strength that I might find
Abiding faith and peace of mind
And I won't ask
Where do I go from here?

Please, Lead me through the darkness
And through each gloomy day.
Take my hand, oh, precious Lord
And help me on my way.

Give me strength that I might find
Abiding faith and peace of mind
And I won't ask
Where do I go from here?"
1520;IT'S RAINING  IT'S RAINING;;"Chorus
It's raining its raining its 
raining once again
the spirit of the lord is moving like 
a might rushing wind
the holy ghost and fire is falling all 
on men
giving them the power to bring the 
harvest it

The prophet said in the last days 
that it would be like this.
He'd pour out His Spirit and 
non he would miss.
Your young men would see visions 
and your 
old men would dream dreams, 
When He poured out that former and 
latter day rain.

He said upon your sons and 
daughters the Spirit would come.
They would start to prophecy and 
speak with other tongues,
that we'd receive the power to be His 
witnesses,
oh I've never seen or felt anything 
like this."
1521;DID I MENTION;;"David sang the praises of the 
glory of Jehovah
Paul preached that all is loss save 
knowing Christ
Little John said He is precious 
by leaning on His bosom
So for a moment may I humbly testify

Did I mention that I love Him how 
I worship and adore him
When I can see no way He makes 
a way
And did I mention that He's been
Faithful to every promise He ever 
made me
I love Him that's all I want to say

And how many sermons can be 
preached about this Jesus
How many songs can be sung about 
God's son
There are not enough words; enough 
notes in the music
To tell the story of all the savior has done

Did I mention that I love Him how 
I worship and adore him
When I can see no way He makes 
a way
And did I mention that He's been faithful to 
every promise He ever made me
I love Him that's all I want to say

Did I mention He's been faithful 
to every promise
He ever made me
I love Him that's all I want to say"
1522;HAKUNA WA KUFANANA;;"Hakuna wa kufanana na Yesu
Hakuna wa kufanana na Yesu
Hakuna wa kufanana na Yesu
Hakuna wa kufanana na Yesu

Yeye anaweza
Yeye anaweza

1523;MY REDEEMER IS FAITHFUL;;"As I look back on the road I've travelled,
I see so many times He carried me through;
And if there's one thing that I've learned in 
my life,
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

My Redeemer is faithful and true.
Everything He has said He will do,
And every morning His mercies are new.
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

My heart rejoices when I read the promise
'There is a place I am preparing for you.'
I know someday I'll see my Lord face to face,
'Cause my Redeemer is faithful and true.
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

My Redeemer is faithful and true.
Everything He has said He will do,
And every morning His mercies are new.
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

And in every situation 
He has proved His love to me;
When I lack the understanding,
He gives more grace to me.

My Redeemer is faithful and true.
Everything He has said He will do,
And every morning His mercies are new.
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

My Redeemer is faithful and true.
Everything He has said He will do,
And every morning His mercies are new.
My Redeemer is faithful and true.
My Redeemer is faithful and true."
