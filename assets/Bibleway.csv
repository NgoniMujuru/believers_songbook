252;That Man From Galilee;Eb;"In a manger long ago, 
I know it's really so,
A Babe was born 
To save men from their sin.
John saw Him on the shore, 
The Lamb forevermore,
Oh, the Christ, 
The Crucified of Calvary.

CHORUS
Oh I love that Man from Galilee,
For He's done so very much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins, 
Placed the Holy Ghost within;
Oh I love that man 
     from Galilee.

The publican went to pray 
In the temple there one day,
He cried, ""O Lord 
     be merciful to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this Man 
     from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk, 
The dumb was made to talk,
That power was spoken with 
Love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man 
     from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of Man 
What must he do.
These words He said to him, 
""Ye must be born again,""
By the Spirit of that Man 
     from Galilee.

The woman at the well, 
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands 
She had at that time,
She was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that 
     Man from Galilee!""";� Public Domain
253;Then Jesus Came;C;"One sat alone beside the 
    highway begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he

He clutched his rags and shivered

Then Jesus came and bade his 
    darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the tempter's 
    power is broken;
When Jesus comes, the tears 
    are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the 
    life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus 
    comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil 
    spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
He cut himself as demon pow'rs 
    possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the 
    captive free.

Unclean! unclean! The leper cried 
    in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness 
    stood near;
The fever raged, disease had gripped 
    its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast 
    out every fear.

So men today have found the 
    Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion, 
    lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them sad 
    and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt 
    Himself within.";� Public Domain

Outcast such as I,

The Saviour bled and died;

A worthless slave to buy,
Who long had law 
And grace defied.

Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.

Doth seek to work us woe -
His craft and pow'r are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.

Lord Sabaoth His name,
From age to age the same -
And He must win the battle.

And tho this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph thru us.
The Prince of darkness grim - 
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! His doom is sure -
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow'rs -
No thanks to them - abideth;

Thru Him who with us sideth.

Come the church His bride to claim,

Feasting, I'm feasting,
Then to deeper truths

Feasting with my Lord.

Often there are only 
     just us two,
Feasting I'm feasting
Then He tells me what 
     He'd have me do,
Feasting with my Lord.

If perchance the cupboard's
     scarce of bread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
On the hidden manna 
      I am fed,
Feasting with my Lord.";� Public Domain
