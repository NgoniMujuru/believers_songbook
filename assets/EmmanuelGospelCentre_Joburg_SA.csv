The blessings are falling tonight,
There's joy, joy, joy in my heart,
Since Jesus made everything right;

I gave Him my old tattered garment,
He gave me a robe of pure white,
I'm feasting on Manna from Heaven,
And that's why I'm happy tonight.

The Lord God sent us a prophet
According to Malachi 4 
To turn the hearts of the childen 
Back to the fathers
The message was sent to restore
We are living now in the end time
The bride is preparing today
The bridegroom has sent us His message
That he'd soon take his bride away

What is the attraction on mount
The Piller of Fire has come
Spiritual food in due season
No need to starve anymore
Revelation 10:7 has sounded
The mysteries have been revealed
The revelation of the seven seals 
Has been opened
And the bridegroom is ready to leave"

And the crown of life is waiting there for me

Like where I want to be
There'll be no tears, to fill our eyes again

Obscuring the brightness of life,
I'm never alarmed 
At the overcast skies,
The Master looks on at the strife.

I know that He safely 
     will carry me through,
No matter what evils betide,
Why should I then care, 
Though the tempest may blow,
If Jesus walks close to my side.

Our troubles will then all be o'er.
The Master so gently

Some golden daybreak, 
Battles all won,
He'll shout the victory, 
Break through the blue,
Some golden daybreak,

Sad hearts will gladden, 
All shall be bright,
Good-bye forever 
To earth's dark night;
Changed in a moment, 
Like Him to be,
Oh, glorious daybreak, 
Jesus I'll see.

Oh, what a meeting, 
There in the skies,
No tears nor crying 
Shall dim our eyes;
Loved ones united 
Eternally,
Oh, what a daybreak 
That morn will be."
228;The Meeting In The Air;Bb;"You have heard of little Moses in the bulrush,
You have heard of fearless David and his sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming 
     Joseph,
And of Jonah and the whale you often sing.
There are many, many others through the Bible,
I should like to meet them all, I do declare!
By and by the Lord will surely let us meet them,
At the meeting in the air.

CHORUS
There is going to be a meeting in the air.
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you, meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky;
Such singing you will hear, 
Never heard by mortal ear,
'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son will be the leading One
At the meeting in the air.

Many things will there be missing 
In that meeting:
For the mourners bench 
Will have no place at all;
There will never be a sermon 
Preached to sinners,
For the sinner had refused to heed the call.
There will be no mourning 
Over wayward loved ones,
There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer;
All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted
At that meeting in the air.

There the doubters will be missing altogether,
All the skeptics will be absent on that day;
There will be no grumblers present to disturb us,
And the Achans will be busy far away.
There the saints will have His 
     ""seal upon their foreheads,""
Dressed in raiment none 
But ransomed ones can wear;
All who have the wedding garments 
     will be present, 
At the meeting in the air."
231;It's Dripping With Blood;Eb;"The first one to die for 
This Holy Ghost plan,
Was John the Baptist, 
But he died like a man;

Then came the Lord Jesus, 
They crucified Him,
He taught that the Spirit 
Would save men from sin.

CHORUS
It's dripping with blood, Yes, 
It's dripping with blood,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood,

The blood of disciples 
Who died for the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, 
And John the divine,
They gave up their lives so 
This Gospel could shine;

They mingled their blood,
Like the prophets of old,
So the true Word of God 
Could honest be told.

Then they stoned Stephen, 
He preached against sin,
He made them so angry, 
They dashed his head in;

But he died in the Spirit, 
And gave up the ghost,
And went to join others, 
In that life-giving host.

There's souls under the altar, 
Crying, ""How long?""
For the Lord to punish 
Those who've done wrong;

But there's going to be more 
Who'll give their life's blood
For this Holy Ghost Gospel 
And its crimson flood."
233;The Homecoming Week;F;"Upon our journey here below 
     we meet with pain and loss;
Sometimes there is a crown of thorns,
     sometimes the heavy cross.
The dreary road to Calvary,
     the bitter goad and sting,
But what's inside those gates of pearl
     will be worth everything.

CHORUS
When we're inside the gates of pearl,
We'll learn a lot of things,
We'll have a harp that's made of gold,
Perhaps a thousand strings;
We'll sing and shout and dance about,
The Lamb will dry our tears;
We'll have a grand homecoming week,
The first ten thousand years.

The shadows now begin to fall,
     the time is drawing nigh,
When Christ our Lord shall come again
     like lightning from the sky.
And while we wait and suffer here, 
     praise God, we'll shout and sing,
For one glimpse through those gates
     of pearl will be worth everything.

The precious blood of God's own Son
     has saved and sanctified
A wondrous people for His name 
     and they are called the Bride.
Though here neglected and despised,
     one day the Lord will bring
His chosen ones within the gates,
     and that's worth everything."
243;Living He Loved me;C;"One day when heaven 
Was filled with His praises,
One day when sin 
Was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth 
To be born of a virgin -
Dwelt amongst men, 
My example is He!

Living, He loved me; 
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried 
My sins far away;
Rising, He justified 
Freely forever:
One day He's coming - 
Oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him 
Up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him 
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, 
Despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins, 
My Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him 
Alone in the garden,
One day He rested, 
From suffering free;
Angels came down 
O'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, 
My Saviour is He!

One day the grave could 
Conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled 
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death 
He had conquered;
Now is ascended, 
My Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will 
Sound for His coming,
One day the skies with 
His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, 
My beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour, 
This Jesus is mine!"
251;In Times Like These;F;"In times like these you need a Saviour,
In times like these you need an anchor
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

This rock is Jesus, Yes, He's the One,
This rock is Jesus, the only One;
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these you need the Bible,
In times like these oh be not idle,
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these, I have a Saviour,
In times like these, I have an anchor,
I'm very sure, I'm very sure,
My anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock."
254;Then Jesus Came;C;"One sat alone beside the 
    highway begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he 
    could not see;

He clutched his rags and shivered 
    in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and bade his 
    darkness flee.

When Jesus comes the tempter's 
    power is broken;
When Jesus comes, the tears 
    are wiped away.

He takes the gloom and fills the 
    life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus 
    comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil 
    spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;

He cut himself as demon pow'rs 
    possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the 
    captive free.

Unclean! unclean! The leper cried 
    in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness 
    stood near;

The fever raged, disease had gripped 
    its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast 
    out every fear.

So men today have found the 
    Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion, 
    lust and sin;

Their broken hearts had left them sad 
    and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt 
    Himself within."
256;When The Saints March In;Eb;"I'm a pilgrim and a stranger
Wand'ring through this world of sin,
On my way to that fair city,
When the Saints go marching in.

When the saints go marching in,
When the saints go marching in,
Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in.

Oh, I know I'll see my Saviour 
If my life is free from sin,
Heaven's doors will open for me
When the Saints go marching in.

When we gather 'round the Throne
And the gates are closed within,
I'll be shouting ""Glory, Glory""
When the Saints go marching in.

I'm waiting for the chariot
To swing low and I'll step in,
On the clouds I'll ride to Heaven
When the Saints go marching in."
272;Psalm 19;Eb;"The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure,
Making wise the simple.

More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The statutes of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure,
Enlightening the eyes.

The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring for ever:
The judgements of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.

And in the keeping of them
There is great reward,
There is great reward.
In the keeping of them
There is great reward."
274;His Banner Over Me Is Love;F;"He  brought me to His banqueting table
His banner over me is love;
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

He set straight paths before my feet
His banner over me is love,
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

He broke the chains and He set me free
His banner over me is love
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

I am my Beloved's and He is mine
His banner over me is love,
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love."
275;Deeper In That Holy Life;F;"Deeper In Thy love, Oh Jesus
Doth my spirit cry to go.
Until all my life is hidden 
Deep within the cleansing flow.

Deeper in that holy life
'Til I'm lost with Christ in God.
Hidden with my blessed Lord
While I walk this earthly sod.

Humbly must I walk with Jesus
In the paths that He doth lead.
Never falter, never murmur
Always to His voice give heed.

Daily must I seek to please Him
Whether it bring joy or pain.
I shall know then just how blessed
Is the worth of Heav'nly gain.

Deeper, 'til at last in Glory
In His likeness I shall come.
Where the saints of all the ages
Shall receive their welcome home."
277;He's The Lord Of Glory;Eb;"Behold what manner of man is this,
Who stills the raging sea.
He heals the sick, the lame, the halt,
And makes the blind to see.
He opens all the prison doors
And sets the captives free.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

CHORUS
He's the Lord of glory
He is the great ""I Am""
The Alpha and Omega,
The beginning and the end.
His name is Wonderful
The Prince of Peace is He
He's the everlasting Father
Throughout eternity.

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who spake to the woman at the well.
Everlasting life I will give to thee,
Far richer than man can tell
And whosoever shall drink of the well
Shall live eternally.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who speaks to the lame and halt.
He says ""Thy sins be forgiven thee,
Take up thy bed and walk""
He stands as the mighty healer now
And cries ""Come unto me""
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this
Who stands between God and man.
His eyes are as a flame of fire
His fan is in His hand.
John saw Him in the seven churches
As the sun in brilliancy
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who sits on His heavenly throne.
He rules and reigns from heaven above
His beloved and His own.
He's the lion of the tribe of Judah,
The root of David is He.
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?"
278;He Touched Me;Eb;"Shackled by a heavy burden
'Neath a load of guilt and shame,
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same.

He touched me,
Oh, He touched me,
And oh, the joy 
That floods my soul!

Something happened, 
And now I know,
He touched me, 
And made me whole.

Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed 
And made me whole,
I shall never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls."
287;His Way With Thee;F;"Would you live for Jesus and 
     be always pure and good?
Would you walk with Him 
     within the narrow road?
Would you have Him bear your 
     burden, carry all your load?
Let Him have His way with thee.

CHORUS
His pow'r can make you what you
     ought to be,
His blood can cleanse your heart
     and make you free:
His love can fill your soul,
And you will see 'twas best for Him
To have His way with Thee.

Would you have Him make you free, 
     and follow at His call?
Would you know the peace that
     comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you,
     so that you need never fall?
Let Him have His way with Thee.

Would you in His kingdom find
     a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true
     in providential test?
Would you in His service labour
     always at your best?
Let Him have His way with Thee."
288;I'm Longing For Jesus To Come;F;"I'm longing for that glorious day
When Jesus shall come back,
I long to see His blessed face.
When all the saints 
Throughout the ages
Shall be gathered home
The ones who trusted in His grace

CHORUS
I'm longing for Jesus to come back
I long for Jesus Christ my King
To come and take me
To my home beyond the skies,
Up there where angels shout and sing.

Sometimes the road 
Seems rough and hard,
The pathway seems so long,
But He is ever by my side.
He whispers loving words to me
And tells me to be strong,
That He will always lead and guide."

304;Worthy;Ab;"Hear the cries of the shackled
From the onset of time
For the chains of defeat there's no key.
See the tears of the broken,
The cries of the slaves
Is there no one worthy to set us free?
Then the crying is stilled 
As the chörus rings out.
The shackled released from their chains,
And thousands of voices
Are swelling the song,
Worthy the lamb that was slain.

Worthy, Worthy,
Worthy the Lamb that was slain.
Worthy, Worthy,
Worthy the Lamb that was slain.

Then all the archangels
The saints of all time
Holding their crowns in their hands
Fall down before Him joining the song
Worthy, Worthy the Lamb

Praise Him, praise Him,
Praise the Lamb that was slain.
Praise Him, praise Him,
Praise the Lamb that was slain.

Love Him, love Him,
Love the Lamb that was slain.

307;My Saviour Crucified;Eb;"I have a loving Saviour
Oh what a Christ have I
To leave His home in Glory
To come to earth to die.
I think of Him so tender
So loving and so kind.
He gave His life for sinners
My Saviour crucified.

And this is why I love Him.
Because He first loved me.
To purchase my redemption
He hung upon a tree.
At last He cried ""Tis finished""
He hung His head and died,
Oh what a sight for sinners,
My Jesus crucified.

They mocked Him 
And they scoffed Him,
With thorns they crowned His head,
As a lamb unto the slaughter
My Saviour! -  He was led.
The soldier's cruel dagger 
Was thrust into His side,
Oh what a sight for sinners,
My Saviour crucified.

I have a risen Savior,
He means so much to me.
I'm longing for His coming, 
His blessed face to see.
I pray I may prove faithful
And in His Word abide.
And one day I shall se Him,
My Savior crucified."

Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

CHORUS
Let the Holy Ghost come in,
Let the Holy Ghost come in,
Make the consecration,
Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

Would you have the Spirit
     in your heart to cheer?
Would you be relieved from
     ev'ry doubt and fear?
Make the consecration,
Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

Do you want the fire of God
     to fill your soul,
Burn up all the dross,
     and sanctify the whole?
Make the consecration,
Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

Do you want the pow'r

So that you can rescue
     those that Christ would save?

Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in."
326;The Solid Rock;F;"My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne."
328;It Is Truly Wonderful;Bb;"He pardoned my transgressions, 
He sanctified my soul,
He honors my confessions, 
Since by His blood I'm whole.

What the Lord has done!
It is truly wonderful! 
It is truly wonderful!
It is truly wonderful  
What the Lord has done!
Glory to His name.

He keeps me every moment  
By trusting in His grace;
'Tis thro His blest atonement,  
That I may see His face.

He brings me through affliction,  
He leaves me not alone;
He's with me in temptation, 
He keeps me for His own.

He prospers and protects me,  
His blessings ever flow;
He fills me with His glory, 
He makes me white as snow.

He keeps me firm and faithful,  
His love I do enjoy,
For this I shall be grateful,
And live in His employ.

There's not a single blessing  
Which we receive on earth
That does not come from heaven,  
The source of our new birth."

A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever ill be tide,
A shelter in the time of storm.

CHORUS
Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land,
A weary land, A weary land;
Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land -
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shade by day, defense by night,
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes afright,
A shelter in the time of storm.

The raging storms may round us beat,
A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.

Oh Rock divine, Oh Refuge dear,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our Helper ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm."
334;How Firm A Foundation;G;"How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said, 
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled?
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, I will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee and cause thee
     to stand,
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for  repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor
     to shake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"

At God the Father's own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.

His name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace;
Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man,
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,
For Thou hast died for all.

Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord;
Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord.

There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord;
There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord.

Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord;
Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord."
358;Break Thou The Bread Of Life;C;"Break Thou the bread of life,
Dear Lord to me,
As Thou didst break
The loaves beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page,
I seek Thee Lord;
My spirit pants for Thee,
Oh living Word!

Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord
To me, To me,
As Thou didst bless
The bread by Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My All in All.

Teach me to live, dear Lord,
Only for Thee,
As Thy disciples lived in Galilee;
Then, all my struggles o'er,
Then, victory won,
I shall behold Thee, Lord,
The living One."
361;I Remember Calvary;Eb;"Where He may lead me, I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him so,
And I remember 'twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

CHORUS
Jesus shall lead me night and day,
Jesus shall lead me all the way,
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

Oh, I delight in His command,
Love to be lead by His dear hand;
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.

Onward I go, no doubt, nor fear,
Happy with Christ my Savior near,
Trusting that I some day shall see,
Jesus, my Friend of Calvary."
367;He Was Nailed To The Cross For Me;Eb;"What a wonderful, wonderful Savior,
Who would die on the cross for me!
Freely shedding His precious life blood,
That the sinner might be made free.

CHORUS
He was nailed to the cross for me,
He was nailed to the cross for me;
On the cross crucified, for me He died;
He was nailed to the cross for me.

Thus He left His heavenly glory
To accomplish His Father's plan;
He was born of the Virgin Mary,
Took upon Him the form of man.

He was wounded  for our transgressions,
And He carried our sorrows, too;
He's the Healer of every sickness,
This He came to the world to do.

So He gave His life for others
In redeeming this world from sin,
And He's gone to prepare a mansion,
That at last we may enter in."
377;My Burdens Rolled Away;F;"I remember when my burdens 
     rolled away,
I had carried them for years, 
Night and day;
When I sought the blessed Lord, 
And I took Him at His Word,
Then at once all 
My burdens rolled away.

CHORUS
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away;
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away.

I remember when 
My burdens rolled away,
That I feared would never leave 
Night or day;
Jesus showed to me the loss, 
So I left them at the cross,
I was glad when 
My burdens rolled away.

I am singing since 
My burdens rolled away,
There's a song within my heart 
Night and day;
I am living for my King, 
And with joy I shout and sing
Hallelujah! all 
My burdens rolled away."
378;Bring Them In;F;"Hark, 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who've gone astray
Far from the Shepherd's fold away.

Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring the little ones to Jesus.

Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wandering ones to find?
Who'll bring the lost ones the fold,
Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountains wild and high,
Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee,
""Go find My sheep where'er they be."""
380;Friendship With Jesus;C;"A friend of Jesus, oh, what bliss
That one so weak as I
Should ever have a friend 
     like this
To lead me to the sky.

Friendship with Jesus,
Fellowship divine;
Oh, what blessed sweet 
     communion,
Jesus is a friend of mine.

A friend when other friendships 
      cease,
A friend when others fail;
A friend who gives me joy 
     and peace,
A friend who will prevail.

A friend to lead me in the dark,
A friend who knows the way;
A friend to steer my weak, 
     frail bark,
A friend my debts to pay.

A friend when sickness lays 
     me low,
A friend when death draws near;
A friend as through the vale I go,
A friend to help and cheer.

A friend when life's rough 
     voyage is o'er.
A friend when death is past;
A friend to greet on heaven's 
     shore,
A friend when home at last."
381;A Glorious Church;C;"Do you hear them coming, brother,
Thronging up the steeps of light,
Clad in glorious shining garments,
Bloodwashed, garments pure

Without spot or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb;
'Tis a glorious church 
Without spot or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb;

     stirring anthems
Filling all the earth and sky,
'Tis a grand victorious army,
Lift its banner up on high!

Never fear the clouds 
     of sorrow,
Never fear the storms of sin,
We shall triumph on 
     the morrow,
Even now our joys begin.

Wave the banner, 
Shout His praises,
For our victory is nigh!
We shall join our 
     conquering Savior,
We shall reign with Him on high!

'Tis a glorious church 
And I am a member,
Washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb;
'Tis a glorious church 
And I am a member,
Washed in the blood 
     of the Lamb;"
382;Jesus Understands;Bb;"Bow'd beneath your burden,

Weary with the journey,

There's a tho't to cheer you,

Chorus
Yes He understands, 
All His ways are best.
Hear, He calls to you,
""Come to me and rest.""

Whether sad or joyful,

Ev'ry heavy burden 
He will gladly share,
Are you sad and weary?
Jesus has a care;
Well He knows the pathway
     o'er life's burning sands,
Courage, fainting pilgrim,
Jesus understands.

Tho' temptation meet you, 
Jesus can sustain,
Life has vexing problems
     which He can explain;
Serve Him where He sends you
     though in distant lands,
Do not doubt or question,
Jesus understands.

Weary heart He calls you, 
""Come to me and rest,""
Does the path grow rugged?
     Yet His way is best;
Leave the unknown future

Whether sad or joyful,

386;He Cometh!;C;"Jesus is coming! go, herald the tidings
Far over the land and the sea;

All language our joy will transcend,
When we shall see Him, the King in His beauty,
Our Bridegroom, Redeemer, and Friend.

Chorus
Jesus is coming, 
Our Saviour and Lover divine;
Soon in His glory 
The ransomed of ages will shine;
Ages on ages we'll reign 
With our King on His throne;
Wonderful story! We'll share in His glory,
Redeemed by His mercy alone.

Lift up your heads and rejoice, 
Oh ye righteous,
Your perfect redemption is nigh;
Swiftly the darkness of midnight approaches,
""He cometh,"" shall sound from the sky.
Long has the battle been waged against evil
By suffering saints here below.
Jesus is coming to banish our sorrow,
And lead us where tears never flow.

Come, dear Lord Jesus. 
Thy promise fulfilling;
""Come quickly!"" our souls cry to Thee:
Long has the world been enthralled 
     by the tempter,
The curse is on land and on sea.
Yet Thou shalt triumph, the nations subduing,
The truth of the Word cannot fail;
God's wondrous glory, like ocean's deep billows,
To earth's farthest bounds shall prevail."
391;He Took My Sins Away;Ab;"I came to Jesus, 
Weary worn and sad,
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.
And now His love 
Has made my heart so glad,
He took my sins away.

CHORUS
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away,
And keeps me singing every day!
I'm so glad He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.

The load of sin 
Was more than I could bear,
He took them all away,
He took them all away.
And now on Him 
I roll my every care,
He took my sins away.

No condemnation 
Have I in my heart,
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.
His perfect peace 
He did to me impart,
He took my sins away.

If you will come 
To Jesus Christ today,
He'll take your sins away,
He'll take your sins away.
And keep you happy 
In His love each day,
He'll take your sins away."
394;Jesus Opened up the Way;Ab;"Jesus Christ the Lord 
Opened up the way to glory
When He died to save us 
From our ruined state.
And He asks that we shall go
Tell the world the story,
How His blood will save them
From their awful fate.

Chorus
Jesus opened up 
The way to heaven's gate
When He died on the cross
To redeem all the lost;
He prepared the road 
That leads to His abode,
'Tis a road, marked by blood
But it leads us home to God.

And the way is marked
By the foot-prints of the Savior,
With His blood He made it,
Made it plain and straight;
If you walk that way,
It will lead you into heaven,
Lead you safely into 
Glory's golden gate.

Sinner, will you come and join
      in this heav'nly journey,
Walk the bloody pathway 
That the Savior trod;
Then when life is over 
And all the sheaves are garnered,
You will meet the Savior 
     and be not afraid."
398;Blessed Be The Fountain;C;"Blessed be the fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God:
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Though I've wandered far from His fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Whiter than the snow,
Whiter than the snow;
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o'ercame;
Grievous were the sorrows he bore,
But He suffered thus not in vain.
May I to that fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below;
Wash me in the blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me-
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."
399;I Need Thee Every Hour;F;"I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
Every hour I need Thee!
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,
I come to Thee!

I need Thee every hour,
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

I need Thee every hour,
Most holy one;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son."

Each day He grows still sweeter 
     than He was the day before.

Chorus
The half cannot be fancied 
      this side the golden shore;
Oh, there He'll be still sweeter

      when I saw Him from afar;
He's fairer than the lily, 
      brighter than the morning star;
He fills and satisfies
      my longing spirit o'er and o'er;
Each day He grows still sweeter 
      than He was the day before.

My heart is sometimes heavy,
      but He comes with sweet relief;
He folds me to His bosom 
      when I droop with blighting grief;
I love the Christ who all my burdens
      in His body bore;
Each day He grows still sweeter 
      than He was the day before."

For Christ's coming Kingdom 
Are you sighing?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

CHORUS"
422;Jesus Saves;F;"We have heard the joyful sound:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Spread the tidings all around:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Bear the news to every land,
Climb the steeps and cross the waves;
Onward! 'tis our Lord's command;
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Waft it on the rolling tide;
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Tell to sinners far and wide:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing, ye islands of the sea;
Echo back, ye ocean caves;
Earth shall keep her jubilee:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Sing above the battle strife,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
By His death and endless life,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing it softly through the gloom,
When the heart for mercy craves;
Sing in triumph o'er the tomb,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Give the winds a mighty voice,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Let the nations now rejoice,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Shout salvation full and free;
Highest hill and deepest caves;
This our song of victory,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!"
423;Since I Have Been Redeemed;F;"I have a song I love to sing,
Since I have been redeemed,
Of my Redeemer, Savior, King,
Since I have been redeemed

CHORUS
Since I have been redeemed,
Since I have been redeemed,
I will glory in His name;
Since I have been redeemed,
I will glory in my Savior's name.

I have a Christ that satisfies,
Since I have been redeemed,
To do His will my highest prize,
Since I have been redeemed.

I have a witness bright and clear,
Since I have been redeemed,
Dispelling ev'ry doubt and fear,
Since I have been redeemed.

I have a home prepared for me,
Since I have been redeemed,
Where I shall dwell eternally,
Since I have been redeemed."
425;Wonderful Story Of Love;Bb;"Wonderful story of love; 
Tell it to me again;
Wonderful story of love; 
Wake the immortal strain!
Angels with rapture announce it,
Shepherds with wonder receive it;
Sinners, O won't you believe it?
Wonderful story  of love.

CHORUS
Wonderful ! Wonderful! Wonderful!
Wonderful story of love.

Wonderful story of love; 
Tho' you are far away;
Wonderful story of love; 
Still He doth call today;
Calling from Calvary's mountain,
Down from the crystal bright fountain,
E'en from the dawn of creation,
Wonderful story of love.

Wonderful story of love; 
Jesus provides a rest;
Wonderful story of love; 
For all the pure and blest,
Rest in those mansions above us,
With those who've gone on before us,
Singing the rapturous chorus,
Wonderful story of love."
426;The Hallelujah Side;Ab;"Once a sinner far from Jesus, 
I was perishing with cold,
But the blessed Savior 
Heard me when I cried;
Then He threw His robe around me, 
And He led me to His fold,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

CHORUS
Oh, glory be to Jesus, 
Let the hallelujahs roll;
Help me ring the Savior's praises 
     far and wide,
For I've opened up tow'rd heaven 
All the windows of my soul,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Tho' the world may sweep around me
With her dazzle and her dreams,
Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,
For my soul looks up to heaven 
Where the golden sunlight gleams,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Not for all earth's golden millions
Would I leave this precious place,
Tho' the tempter to persuade me 
     oft has tried,
For I'm safe in God's pavilion,
Happy in His love and grace,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Here the sun is always shining,
Here the sky is always bright;
'Tis no place for gloomy 
     Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music 
And my heart with great delight,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

And upon the streets of Glory, 
When we reach the other shore,
And have safely crossed the Jordan's 
     rolling tide,
You will find me shouting ""Glory"" 
Just outside my mansion door,
Where I'm living on the hallelujah side."
444;I've Anchored In Jesus;Ab;"Upon life's boundless ocean 
Where mighty billows roll,
I've fixed my hope in Jesus, 
Blest anchor of my soul;
When trials fierce assail me 
As storms are gathering o'er,
I rest upon His mercy 
And trust Him more.

CHORUS
I've anchored in Jesus, 
The storms of life I'll brave,
I've anchored in Jesus, 
I fear no wind or wave,
I've anchored in Jesus, 
For He hath power to save,
I've anchored to the Rock of Ages.

He keeps my soul from evil 
And gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters 
And bid their tumult cease;
My pilot and deliverer, 
To Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him, 
He's at my side,

He is my Friend and Savior, 
In Him my anchor's cast,
He drives away my sorrows 
And shields me from the blast;
By faith I'm looking upward 
Beyond life's troubled sea,
There I behold a haven 
Prepared for me."
448;Wonderful Peace;Ab;"Far away in the depths 
Of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody 
Sweeter than psalm;
In celestial like strains 
It unceasingly falls
O'er my soul 
Like an infinite calm.

CHORUS
Peace! peace! wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray
In fathomless billows of love.

What a treasure I have 
In this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul;
So secure that no power 
Can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll.

I am resting tonight 
In this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus' control;
For I'm kept from all danger 
By night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul.

And me thinks when I rise 
To that city of peace,
Where the author of peace 
I shall see,
That one strain of the song 
Which the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom shall be:

Ah! soul, are you here 
Without comfort or rest,
Marching down the rough 
Pathway of time?
Make Jesus your friend 
Ere the shadows grow dark;
Oh, accept this sweet 
Peace so sublime."
456;The Cleansing Wave;C;"Oh! now I see the crimson wave,
The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save
Points to His wounded side.

CHORUS
The cleansing stream, I see, I see!
I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me!
Oh! praise the Lord, it cleanseth me,
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me!

I see the new creation rise,
I hear the speaking blood,
It speaks! polluted nature dies!
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

I rise to walk in heav'n's own light
Above the world and sin,
With heart made pure, and 
     garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

Amazing grace! 'tis heav'n below
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus know,
My Jesus crucified."
459;Amazing Grace how sweet the sound;F;"Amazing grace! 
     How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, 
     but now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught 
     my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did 
      that grace appear
The hour I first believed;

Thro' many dangers, 
      toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought 
      me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised 
    good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my shield 
    and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh 
    and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, 
    within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The world shall 
     soon to ruin go,
The sun refuse to shine;
But God, who called 
     me here below,
Shall be forever mine.

When we've been 
      there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days 
      to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

Praise God, Praise God
    Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Praise God, 
    Praise God.
Praise God, Praise God
    Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Praise God,
    Praise God.

Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen.
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen."
463;I Know Whom I Have Believed;C;"I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

But I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day.

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus thro' the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air."
464;I Believe Jesus Saves;F;"I am coming to Jesus for rest,
Rest, such as the purified know;
My soul is athirst to be blest,
To be washed and made 
     whiter than snow.

CHORUS
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow;
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow.

In coming, my sin I deplore,
My weakness and poverty show;
I long to be saved evermore,
To be washed and made 
     whiter than snow.

To Jesus I give up my all,
Every treasure and idol I know;
For His fullness of blessing I call,
Till His blood washes 
     whiter than snow"
468;Oh Happy Day;F;"Oh happy day that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Savior and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

CHORUS
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away.

'Tis done, the great transaction's done;
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;
He drew me, and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

Now rest, my long-divided heart;
Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
Nor ever from my Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed."
470;Stand Up For Jesus;G;"Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
ye soldiers of the cross,
Lift high His royal banner, 
it must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory, 
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished 
and Christ is Lord  indeed.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict, 
in this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him, 
against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, 
and strength to strength oppose.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus; 
stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you - 
ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor, 
and watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger, 
be never wanting there."
471;Yesterday, Today, Forever;Ab;"Oh, how sweet the glorious message, 
     simple faith may claim;
Yesterday today, forever,
 Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful, 
     heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest; 
     Glory to His name!

Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never! 
     Glory to His name, 
Glory to His name, Glory to his name;
All may change but Jesus never! 
     Glory to His name.

He who was the friend of sinners, 
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at 
His footstool penitently bow.
He who said, ""I'll not condemn thee, 
     go and sin no more;""
Speaks to thee that word of pardon, 
     as in days of yore.

Oft on earth He healed the sufferer 
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows 
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue, 
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His fullness 
Still will give as much.

As of old He walked to Emmaus, 
      with them to abide;
So through all life's way He walketh, 
      ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him, 
     hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be this same Jesus, 
     as He went away."
488;Jesus Is Calling;C;"Jesus is tenderly calling thee home
Calling today, calling today;
Why from the sunshine 
Of love wilt thou roam
Farther and farther away?

CHORUS
Calling today,
Calling today,
Jesus is calling,
Is tenderly calling today.

Jesus is calling the weary to rest
Calling today, calling today;
Bring Him thy burden 
And thou shalt be blest;
He will not turn thee away.

Jesus is waiting; 
Oh come to Him now
Waiting today, waiting today;
Come with thy sins; 
At His feet lowly bow;
Come, and no longer delay.

Jesus is pleading; 
Oh list to His voice:
Hear Him today, 
Hear Him today;
They who believe 
On His name shall rejoice;
Quickly arise and away."
489;Jesus, I Come;Ab;"Out of my bondage, sorrow and night,
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
Into Thy freedom, gladness and light,
Jesus, I come to Thee;
Out of my sickness into Thy health,
Out of my want and into Thy wealth,
Out of my sin and into Thyself,
Jesus, I come to Thee.

Out of my shameful failure and loss,
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
Into the glorious gain of Thy cross,
Jesus, I come to Thee;
Out of earth's sorrows into Thy balm,
Out of life's storms and into Thy calm,
Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
Jesus, I come to Thee.

Out of unrest and arrogant pride,
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
Into Thy blessed will to abide,
Jesus, I come to Thee;
Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,
Out of despair into raptures above,
Upward for aye on wings like a dove,
Jesus, I come to Thee.

Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
Into the joy and light of Thy home,
Jesus, I come to Thee;
Out of the depths of ruin untold,
Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
Jesus, I come to Thee."
496;Jesus Is Passing This Way;Eb;"Is there a heart that is waiting,
Longing for pardon today?
Hear the glad message we bring you,
Jesus is passing this way.

CHORUS
Jesus is passing this way,
This way...today;
Jesus is passing this way,
Is passing this way today.

Coming in love and in mercy,
Quickly now unto Him go;
Open your heart to receive Him,
Pardon and peace He'll bestow.

Listen, the Spirit is calling,
Jesus will freely forgive,
Why not this moment accept Him?
Trust in God's mercy and live.

He is so tender and loving,
He is so near you today;
Open your heart to receive Him,
While He is passing this way."
497;Let Jesus Come Into Your Heart;F;"If you are tired of 
The load of your sin,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If you desire a new life to begin,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

CHORUS
Just now, your doubtings give o'er;
Just now, reject Him no more;
Just now, throw open the door;
Let Jesus come into your heart.

If 'tis for purity now that you sigh,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
Fountains for cleansing 
Are flowing near by,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

If there's a tempest 
Your voice cannot still,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If there's a void 
This world never can fill,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

If you would join 
The glad songs of the blest,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If you would enter 
The mansions of rest,
Let Jesus come into your heart."
499;Jesus Breaks Every Fetter;Ab;"Jesus breaks every fetter,
Jesus breaks every fetter,
Jesus breaks every fetter,
And He sets me free.

I am now on the altar,
I am now on the altar,
I am now on the altar
Which was made for me.

I will never doubt my Savior,
I will never doubt my Savior,
I will never doubt my Savior,
For He cleanses me.

I will rest on His promise,
I will rest on His promise,
I will rest on His promise,
Which is given to me.

I will shout Hallelujah!
I will shout Hallelujah!
I will shout Hallelujah!
For He sets me free."
501;Softly And Tenderly;Ab;"Softly and tenderly 
Jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me;
See, on the portals 
He's waiting and watching,
Watching for you and for me.

Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary, come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, 
Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home!

Why should we tarry 
When Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger 
And heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

Time is now fleeting, 
The moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering, 
Deathbeds are coming,
Coming for you and for me.

Oh! for the wonderful love 
He has promised,
Promised for you and for me;
Though we have sinned, 
He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me."
504;Death Hath No Terrors;Ab;"Death has no terrors for the
    blood-bought one,
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
The boasted vict'ry of the grave
    is gone,
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!

CHORUS
Jesus rose from the dead,
Rose triumphant as He said,
Snatched the vict'ry from
    the grave,
Rose again our souls to save
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!

Our souls die daily to the world
    and sin,
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
By the Spirit's power as He dwells
    within,
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!

We seek a city far beyond this vale,
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
Where joys celestial never, never
    fail,
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!

We'll then press forward to the
    heav'nly land,
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
Nor mind the troubles met on
    ev'ry hand,
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!

We'll rise some day just as our
    Savior rose,
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!
Till then shall death be but a
    calm repose.
Oh glory hallelujah to the Lamb!"
507;Be Thou My Vision;Eb;"Be Thou my Vision, Oh Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, Save that Thou art;
Thou my best thought, By day or by night
Waking or sleeping, My presence my light.

Be Thou my Wisdom, And Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee And Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling, And I with Thee one.

Riches I heed not, Nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, Now and always;
Thou and Thou only, First in my heart
High King of heaven, My Treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, My victory won, 
May I reach heaven's joys, 
Oh bright heav'n's Son!
Heart of my own heart, Whatever befall,
Still be my Vision, Oh Ruler of all.

Be Thou my breast-plate, My sword for the fight,
Be Thou my armour, And be Thou my might;
Thou my soul's shelter, And Thou my high tower,
Raise Thou me heavenward, Oh Power of my Power."

Thou silver moon with softer gleam:

O praise Him, O praise Him,
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

Thou rushing wind that art so strong,
Ye clouds that sail in heaven along,
O praise Him, hallelujah!
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice,
Ye lights of evening, find a voice:

Thou flowing water, pure and clear,
Make music for thy Lord to hear,
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Thou fire so masterful and bright,
That givest man both warmth and light:

And all ye men of tender heart,
Forgiving others, take your part,
O sing ye, hallelujah!
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,
Praise God and on Him cast your care:

Let all things their Creator bless,

Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
And praise the Spirit, Three-in-One:"
511;All Hail the Power of Jesus Name;;"All hail the power of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God,
Who from His altar call;
Extol Him in whose path ye trod,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race,
Ye ransomed of the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Sinners, whose love can ne’er forget
The wormwood and the gall,
Go, spread your trophies at His feet,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Let every kindred, every tribe
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.

O that, with yonder sacred throng,
We at His feet may fall,
Join in the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all!"
512;All People That on Earth Do Dwell;;"All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
Him serve with mirth, His praise forthtell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.

Know that the Lord is God indeed,
Without our aid He did us make:
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.

O enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto:
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do.

For why, the Lord our God is good;
His mercy is forever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.

Praise Him above, ye heavenly hosts;

514;All Things Bright and Beautiful;;"All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all.

Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colours,
He made their tiny wings.

The purple-headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset, and the morning
That brightens up the sky.

The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.

He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well."
516;And Can it Be;;"And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Saviour’s blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

’Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies:
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the first-born seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine!
’Tis mercy all! let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more.
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

He left His Father’s throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam’s helpless race.
‘Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own. 
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?"
518;Angels From the Realms of Glory;;"Angels, from the realms of Glory,
Wing your flight o’er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation’s story,

Christ, the new-born King.
Come and worship

Shepherds, in the field abiding,
Watching o’er your flocks by night,
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the infant-light:

Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great desire of nations,
Ye have seen His natal star:

Saints, before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord descending
In His temple shall appear:"
519;Angel Voices Ever Singing;;"Angel voices ever singing
Round Thy throne of light,
Angel harps forever ringing,
Rest not day nor night;

Thousands only live to bless Thee,
And confess Thee
Lord of might.

Thou who art beyond the farthest
Mortal eye can scan,
Can it be that Thou regardest
Songs of sinful man?

Can we know that Thou art near us
And wilt hear us?
Yes, we can.

Yes, we know that Thou rejoicest
O’er each work of Thine;
Thou didst ears and hands and voices
For Thy praise design;

Craftsman’s art and music’s measure
For Thy pleasure
All combine.

In Thy house, great God, we offer
Of Thine own to Thee,
And for Thine acceptance proffer,
All unworthily,

Hearts and minds and hands and voices
In our choicest
Psalmody.

Honour, glory, might, and merit
Thine shall ever be,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
Blessed Trinity.

Of the best that Thou hast given
Earth and heaven
Render Thee."
520;A Safe Stronghold Our God is Still;;"As safe a stronghold our God is still,
A trusty shield and weapon;
He’ll help us clear from all the ill
That hath us now o’ertaken.
The ancient prince of hell
Hath risen with purpose fell;
Strong mail of craft and power
He weareth in this hour;
On earth is not His fellow.

With force of arms we nothing can,
Full soon were we down-ridden;
But for us fights the proper Man,
Whom God Himself hath bidden.
Ask ye: Who is this same?
Christ Jesus is His name,
The Lord Sabaoth’s Son;
He, and no other one,
Shall conquer in the battle.

And were this world all devils o’er,
And watching to devour us,
We lay it not to heart so sore;
Not they can overpower us.
And let the prince of ill
Look grim as e’er he will,
He harms us not a whit;
For why? his doom is writ;
A word shall quickly slay him.

God’s word, for all their craft and force,
One moment will not linger,
But, spite of hell, shall have its course;
’Tis written by His finger.
And though they take our life,
Goods, honour, children, wife,
Yet is their profit small:
These things shall vanish all;
The city of God remaineth."
521;As With Gladness;;"As with gladness men of old
Did the guiding star behold;
As with joy they hailed its light,
Leading onward, beaming bright,
So, most gracious God, may we
Evermore be led by Thee.

As with joyful steps they sped,
Saviour, to Thy lowly bed,
There to bend the knee before
Thee whom heaven and earth adore,
So may we with willing feet
Ever seek Thy mercy-seat.
As they offered gifts most rare
At Thy cradle rude and bare,
So may we with holy joy,
Pure, and free from sin’s alloy,
All our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.

Holy Jesus, every day
Keep us in the narrow way;
And, when earthly things are past,
Bring our ransomed souls at last
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

In the heavenly country bright
Need they no created light;
Thou its light, its joy, its crown,
Thou its sun, which goes not down.
There forever may we sing
Hallelujahs to our King."
522;At the Name of Jesus;;"At the name of Jesus,
Every knee shall bow,
Every tongue confess Him
King of glory now;
’Tis the Father’s pleasure
We should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning
Was the mighty Word.

Humbled for a season,
To receive a name
From the lips of sinners
Unto whom He came;
Faithfully He bore it
Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious,
When from death He passed.

Bore it up triumphant
With its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures
To the central height,
To the throne of Godhead,
To the Father’s breast,
Filled it with the glory
Of that perfect rest.

In your hearts enthrone Him;
There let Him subdue
All that is not holy,
All that is not true;
Crown Him as your Captain
In temptation’s hour,
Let His will enfold you
In its light and power.

Brothers, this Lord Jesus
Shall return again,
With His Father’s glory,
With His angel-train;
For all wreaths of empire
Meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him
King of glory now."
524;Before the Throne of God Above;;"Before the throne of God above,
I have a strong, a perfect plea,
A great High Priest whose name is Love,
Who ever lives and pleads for me.
My name is graven on His hands,
My name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart,
No tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair,
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look and see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin.
Because the sinless Saviour died,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me,
To look on Him and pardon me.

Behold Him there! The risen Lamb,
My perfect, spotless righteousness;
The great unchangeable I AM,
The King of glory and of grace!
One with Himself I cannot die,
My soul is purchased with His blood;
My life is hid with Christ on high,
With Christ, my Saviour and my God,
With Christ my Saviour and my God."
525;Behold the Servant of the Lord;;"Behold the servant of the Lord:
I wait Thy guiding eye to feel,
To hear and keep Thy every word,
To prove and do Thy perfect will;
Joyful from my own works to cease,
Glad to fulfil all righteousness.

Me if Thy grace vouchsafe to use,
Meanest of all Thy creatures, me.
The deed, the time, the manner choose:
Let all my fruit be found of Thee.
Let all my works in Thee be wrought,
By Thee to full perfection brought.

My every weak though good design
O’errule or change, as seems Thee meet:
Jesus, let all my work be Thine –
Thy work, O Lord, is all complete,
And pleasing in Thy Father’s sight;
Thou only hast done all things right.

Here then to Thee Thine own I leave;
Mould as Thou wilt Thy passive clay;
But let me all Thy stamp receive,
But let me all Thy words obey,
Serve with a single heart and eye,
And in Thy glory live and die."
526;Be Known to us in Breaking Bread;;"Be known to is breaking bread,
But do not then depart;
Saviour, abide with us, and spread
Thy table in our heart.

There sup with us in love divine;
Thy body and Thy blood,
That living bread, that heavenly wine,
Be our immortal food.

We would not live by bread alone,
But by Thy word of grace,
In strength of which we travel on
To our abiding place."
527;Beneath the Cross;;"Beneanth the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat,
And the burden of the day.

O safe and happy shelter!
O refuge tried and sweet!
O trysting place where heaven’s love
And heaven’s justice meet!
As to the holy patriarch
That wondrous dream was given,
So seems my Saviour’s cross to me
A ladder up to heaven.

There lies, beneath its shadow,
But on the farther side,
The darkness of an awful grave
That gapes both deep and wide;
And there between us stands the cross,
Two arms outstretched to save;
Like a watchman set to guard the way
From that eternal grave.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart, with tears,
Two wonders I confess—
The wonders of His glorious love,
And my own worthlessness.

I take, O cross, thy shadow,
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss—
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross."
529;Be Thou my Vision;;"Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart,
Be all else but naught to me, save that Thou art;
Be Thou my best thought in the day and the night,
Both waking and sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true word,
Be Thou ever with me, and I with Thee, Lord;
Be Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;
Be Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight;
Be Thou my whole armour, be Thou my true might;
Be Thou my soul’s shelter, be Thou my strong tower:
O raise Thou me heavenward, great Power of my power.

Riches I need not, nor man’s empty praise:
Be Thou mine inheritance now and always;
Be Thou and Thou only the first in my heart:
O Sovereign of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, Thou heaven’s bright Sun,
O grant me its joys after victory is won;
Great Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be Thou my vision, O Ruler of all."

533;Break Thou the Bread of Life;;"Break thou the bread of Life,
Dear Lord, to me,
As Thou didst break the bread
Beside the sea;

Beyond the sacred page
I seek Thee, Lord;
My spirit longs for Thee,
Thou Living Word.

Thou art the Bread of Life,
O Lord, to me,
Thy holy Word the truth
That saveth me;

Give me to eat and live
With Thee above;
Teach me to love Thy truth,
For Thou art love.

O send Thy Spirit, Lord,
Now unto me,
That He may touch my eyes
And make me see;

Show me the truth concealed
Within Thy Word,
And in Thy Book revealed,
I see Thee, Lord.

Bless Thou the Bread of Life
To me, to me,
As Thou didst bless the loaves
By Galilee;

Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My all in all."
534;Breathe On Me, Breath of God;;"Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Fill me with life anew;
That I may love what Thou dost love
And do what Thou wouldst do.

Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Until my heart is pure;
Until my will is one with Thine
To do and to endure.

Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Till I am wholly Thine;
Until this earthly part of me
Glows with Thy fire divine.

Breathe on me, Breath of God,
So shall I never die,
But live with Thee the perfect life
Of Thine eternity."
535;Christians Awake;;"Christians awake! Salute the happy morn,
Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born;
Rise to adore the mystery of love
Which hosts of angels chanted from above;
With them the joyful tidings first begun
Of God Incarnate and the Virgin’s Son.

Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
Who heard the angelic herald’s voice ‘Behold,
I bring good tidings of a Saviour’s birth
To you and all the nations upon earth:
This day hath God fulfilled His promised word,
This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord.’

He spake; and straightway the celestial choir
In hymns of joy unknown before conspire;
High praise of God’s redeeming love they sang,
And heaven’s whole orb with hallelujahs rang;
God’s highest glory was their anthem still,
‘On earth be peace, and unto men goodwill.’

O may we keep and ponder in our mind
God’s wondrous love in saving lost mankind;
Trace we the Babe who hath retrieved our loss,
From His poor manger to His bitter cross;
Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,
Till man’s first heavenly state again takes place.

Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,
To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphant song:
He that was born upon this joyful day
Around us all His glory shall display;
Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
Eternal praise to heaven’s almighty King."
536;Christ the Lord is Risen Today;;"Christ the Lord is Risen today: Hallelujah!
Sons of men and angels say: Hallelujah!

Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply: Hallelujah!

Love’s redeeming work is done: Hallelujah!
Fought the fight, the battle won: Hallelujah!
Vain the stone, the watch, the seal: Hallelujah!
Christ hath burst the gates of hell: Hallelujah!

Lives again our glorious King: Hallelujah!
Where, O death, is now thy sting? Hallelujah!
Once He died, our souls to save: Hallelujah!
Where thy victory, O grave? Hallelujah!

Soar we now where Christ hath led: Hallelujah!
Following our exalted Head: Hallelujah!
Made like Him, like Him we rise: Hallelujah!
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies: Hallelujah!

Christ, the true, the only light,
Sun of righteousness, arise,
Triumph o'er the shades of night:
Day-spring from on high, be near;
Day-star in my heart appear.

Dark and cheerless is the morn
Unaccompanied by Thee;
Joyless is the day's return,
Till Thy mercy's beams I see;
Till they inward light impart,
Glad my eyes, and warm my heart.

Visit then this soul of mine;
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
Fill me, radiancy divine;
Scatter all my unbelief;
More and more Thyself display,
Shining to the perfect day."
539;Come down, O Love Divine;;"Come down, O Love Divine,
Seek Thou this soul of mine
And visit it with Thine own ardour glowing;
O Comforter, draw near,
Within my heart appear,
And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.

O let it freely burn,
Till earthly passions turn
To dust and ashes, in its heat consuming;
And let Thy glorious light
Shine ever on my sight,
And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.

Let holy charity
Mine outward vesture be,
And lowliness become mine inner clothing;
True lowliness of heart,
Which takes the humbler part,
And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.

And so the yearning strong,
With which the soul will long,
Shall far outpass the power of human telling;
For none can guess its grace,
Till he become the place
Wherein the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling."
540;Come Let Us Join Our Cheerful Songs;;"Come, let us join our cheerful songs,
With angels round the throne;
Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,

‘To be exalted thus.’

‘For He was slain for us.’

Jesus is worthy to receive
Honour and power divine:
And blessings, more than we can give,
Be, Lord, forever Thine.

Let all that dwell above the sky,
And air, and earth, and seas,
Conspire to lift Thy glories high,
And speak Thine endless praise.

To bless the sacred name
Of Him that sits upon the throne
And to adore the Lamb."

Tender and true;
Out of the heart of the Father above,
Streaming to me and to you:
Wonderful love
Dwells in the heart of the Father above.

Jesus, the Saviour, this gospel to tell,
Joyfully came;
Came with the helpless and hopeless to dwell,
Sharing their sorrow and shame;
Seeking the lost,
Saving, redeeming at measureless cost.

Jesus is seeking the wanderers yet;
Why do they roam?
Love only waits to forgive and forget;
Home, weary wanderer, home!
Wonderful love
Dwells in the heart of the Father above.

Come to my heart, O Thou wonderful love,
Come and abide,
Lifting my life, till it rises above
Envy and falsehood and pride,
Seeking to be
Lowly and humble, a learner of Thee."
542;Come Ye Thankful People Come;;"Come, ye thankful people, come,
Raise the song of harvest home!
All is safely gathered in
Ere the winter storms begin;

God, our Maker, doth provide
For our needs to be supplied;
Come to God’s own temple, come,
Raise the song of harvest-home.

All the world is God’s own field,
Fruit unto His praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown,
Unto joy or sorrow grown;

First the blade, and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear:
Lord of harvest, grant that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.

For the Lord our God shall come
And shall take His harvest home,
From His field shall in that day
All offences purge away,

Give His angels charge at last
In the fire the tares to cast,
But the fruitful ears to store
In His garner evermore.

Even so, Lord, quickly come,
Bring Thy final harvest home;
Gather Thou Thy people in,
Free from sorrow, free from sin;

There, forever purified,
In Thy garner to abide:
Come, with all Thine angels, come,
Raise the glorious harvest-home."

The Lamb upon His throne;
Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity.

Crown Him the Lord of life,
Who triumphed o’er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save:
His glories now we sing,
Who died and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die.

Crown Him the Lord of love;
Behold His hands and side,
Those wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified:
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends His burning eye
At mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of peace,
Whose power a sceptre sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
And all be prayer and praise:
His reign shall know no end,
And round His pierced feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown Him the Lord of years,
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime!
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
Throughout eternity."
544;Dear Lord and Father of Mankind;;"Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
Forgive our foolish ways;
Reclothe us in our rightful mind;
In purer lives Thy service find,
In deeper reverence, praise,
In deeper reverence, praise.

In simple trust like theirs who heard,
Beside the Syrian sea,
The gracious calling of the Lord,
Let us, like them, without a word
Rise up and follow Thee,
Rise up and follow Thee.

O sabbath rest by Galilee!
O calm of hills above,
Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee
The silence of eternity,
Interpreted by love,
Interpreted by love.

With that deep hush subduing all
Our words and works that drown
The tender whisper of Thy call,
As noiseless let Thy blessing fall
As fell Thy manna down,
As fell Thy manna down.
Drop Thy still dews of quietness,
Till all our strivings cease;
Take from our souls the strain and stress,
And let our ordered lives confess
The beauty of Thy peace,
The beauty of Thy peace.

Breathe through the heats of our desire
Thy coolness and Thy balm;
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire,
O still small voice of calm,
O still small voice of calm!"

And hushed their raging at Thy word,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
And calm amid the storm didst sleep:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

O Holy Spirit, who didst brood
Upon the waters dark and rude,
And bid their angry tumult cease,
And give, for wild confusion, peace:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

O Trinity of love and power,

From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe'er they go:

Glad hymns of praise from land and sea."

Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove

Of praise in every part:

Praise in the common things of life,
Its goings out and in;
Praise in each duty and each deed,
However small and mean.

Fill every part of me with praise;
Let all my being speak
Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,
Poor though I be and weak.

So shall Thou, gracious Lord, from me
Receive the glory due;

The song forever new.

Be fellowship with Thee."

Rising to His throne on high.

Hold me with Thy powerful hand:
Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven,
Feed me now and ever more,
Feed me now and ever more.

Open Thou the crystal fountain
Whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through:
Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield,
Be Thou still my strength and shield.

When I tread the verge of Jordan
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Death of death, and hell’s destruction,
Land me safe on Canaan’s side:
Songs of praises, songs of praises,
I will ever give to Thee,
I will ever give to Thee."
561;Hail Thou Once Despised Jesus;;"Hail, thou once despised Jesus,
Hail, Thou Galilean King!
Thou didst suffer to release us,
Thou didst free salvation bring.
Hail, Thou agonising Saviour,
Bearer of our sin and shame;
By Thy merits we find favour,
Life is given through Thy name.

Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
All our sins on Thee were laid.
With almighty love anointed
Thou hast full atonement made.
All Thy people are forgiven
Through the virtue of Thy blood:
Opened is the gate of heaven,
Man is reconciled to God.

Jesus, hail! enthroned in glory,
There forever to abide;
All the heavenly hosts adore Thee,
Seated at Thy Father’s side:
There for sinners Thou art pleading,
There Thou dost our place prepare,
Ever for us interceding,
Till in glory we appear.

Worship, honour, power, and blessing
Thou art worthy to receive:
Loudest praises, without ceasing,
Right it is for us to give:
Come, O mighty Holy Spirit,
As our hearts and hands we raise,
Help us sing our Saviour’s merits,
Help us sing Immanuel’s praise."
562;Hail to the Lord's Annointed;;"Hail to the Lord's anointed,
Great David’s greater Son!
Hail, in the time appointed,
His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
To set the captive free,
To take away transgression,
And rule in equity.

He comes, with succour speedy,
To those who suffer wrong;
To help the poor and needy,
And bid the weak be strong;
To give them songs for sighing,
Their darkness turn to light,
Whose souls, condemned and dying,
Were precious in His sight.

He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth;
Love, joy and hope, like flowers,
Spring in His path to birth;
Before Him, on the mountains,
Shall peace, the herald, go;
And righteousness, in fountains,
From hill to valley flow.

Kings shall fall down before Him,
And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing;
To Him shall prayer unceasing
And daily vows ascend,
His kingdom still increasing,
A kingdom without end.

O’er every foe victorious,
He on His throne shall rest;
From age to age more glorious,
All-blessing and all-blessed.
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His name shall stand forever,
His changeless name of Love."

Thunder like a mighty flood:
‘Jesus out of every nation
Hath redeemed us by His blood.’

Hallelujah! not as orphans
Are we left in sorrow now;
Hallelujah! He is near us,
Faith believes, nor questions how.
Though the clouds from sight receivedHim
When the forty days were o’er,
Shall our hearts forget His promise,
‘I am with you ever more’?

Hallelujah! Bread of heaven,
Thou on earth our food, our stay;
Hallelujah! here the sinful
Flee to Thee from day to day.
Intercessor, Friend of sinners,
Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me
Where the songs of all the sinless
Sweep across the crystal sea.

Hallelujah! sing to Jesus;
His the sceptre, His the throne;
Hallelujah! His the triumph,
His the victory alone.

Thunder like a mighty flood:
‘Jesus out of every nation
Hath redeemed us by His blood.’"
564;Hark the Glad Sound;;"Hark the glad sound! The Saviour comes,
The Saviour promised long;
Let every heart prepare a throne,
And every voice a song.

He comes the prisoners to release,
In Satan’s bondage held;
The gates of brass before Him burst,
The iron fetters yield.

He comes the broken heart to bind,
The bleeding soul to cure,
And with the treasures of His grace
To enrich the humble poor.

Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
Thy welcome shall proclaim;
And heaven’s eternal arches ring
With Thy beloved name."

569;He Who Would Valiant Be;;"He who would valiant be
’Gainst all disaster,
Let him in constancy
Follow the Master.
There’s no discouragement
Shall make him once relent
His first avowed intent
To be a pilgrim.

Who so beset him round
With dismal stories,
Do but themselves confound—
His strength the more is.
No foes shall stay his might,
Though he with giants fight;
He will make good his right
To be a pilgrim.

Since, Lord, Thou dost defend
Us with Thy Spirit,
We know we at the end
Shall life inherit.
Then fancies flee away!
I’ll fear not what men say,
I’ll labour night and day
To be a pilgrim."

Early in the morning
Our song shall rise to Thee:

Casting down their golden crowns
Around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
Who were, and are, and ever more shall be.

Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power, in love and purity.

O Lord of hosts,
My soul longs and yearns for Your courts,
And my heart and flesh sing for joy
To the living God.

One day in Your presence
Is far better to me than gold,
Or to live my whole life somewhere else;
And I would rather be
A doorkeeper in Your house

Than to take my fate upon myself.
You are my sun and my shield,
You are my lover from the start,
And the highway to Your city
Runs through my heart."
576;How Sweet the name of Jesus Sounds;;"How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary, rest.

Dear name, the rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place,
My never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace!

Jesus! My Shepherd, Saviour, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest and King,
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring.

Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I’ll praise Thee as I ought.

Till then I would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath;
And may the music of Thy name
Refresh my soul in death."
577;I am Trusting Thee Lord Jesus;;"I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
Trusting only Thee!
Trusting Thee for full salvation,

At Thy feet I bow;
For Thy grace and tender mercy,
Trusting now.

I am trusting Thee for cleansing
In the crimson flood;
Trusting Thee to make me holy,
By Thy blood.

I am trusting Thee for power,
Thine can never fail;
Words which Thou Thyself shalt give me
Must prevail.

I am trusting Thee to guide me,
Thou alone shalt lead;
Every day and hour supplying
All my need.

I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
Never let me fall;
I am trusting Thee for ever,
And for all."
578;I Cannot Tell;;"I cannot tell why He, whom angels worship,
Should set His love upon the sons of men,
Or why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wanderers,
To bring them back, they know not how or when.
But this I know, that He was born of Mary,
When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home,
And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured,
And so the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is come.

I cannot tell how silently He suffered,
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,
Or how His heart upon the cross wasbroken,
The crown of pain to three-and-thirty years.
But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,
And stays our sin, and calms our lurkingfear,
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden,
For yet the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is here.

I cannot tell how He will win the nations,
How He will claim His earthly heritage,
How satisfy the needs and aspirations
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.
But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,
And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendour,
When He the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is known.

I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,
When, at his bidding, every storm is stilled,
Or who can say how great the jubilation
When all the hearts of men with love are filled.
But this I know, the skies will thrill with rapture,
And myriad, myriad human voices sing,
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth, will answer:
‘At last the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is King!’"
579;I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say;;"I heard the voice of Jesus say:
‘Come unto Me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast.’
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary and worn and sad;
I found in Him a resting place,
And He has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say:
‘Behold I freely give
The living water, thirsty one,
Stoop down and drink and live.’
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,

And now I live in Him.
I heard the voice of Jesus say:
‘I am this dark world’s light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright.’
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that light of life I’ll walk,
Till travelling days are done."
581;Immortal Invisible;;"Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.

Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;
Thy justice like mountains high soaring above
Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.

To all life Thou givest, to both great and small;
In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
And wither and perish; but naught changeth Thee.

Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,
Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;
All laud we would render: O help us to see
’Tis only the splendour of light hideth Thee."
582;In Heavenly Love Abiding;;"In heavenly love abiding,
No change my heart shall fear;
And safe is such confiding,
For nothing changes here:
The storm may roar without me,
My heart may low be laid;
But God is round about me,
And can I be dismayed?

Wherever He may guide me,
No want shall turn me back;
My Shepherd is beside me,
And nothing can I lack:
His wisdom ever waketh,
His sight is never dim;
He knows the way He taketh,
And I will walk with Him.

Green pastures are before me,
Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be o’er me,
Where darkest clouds have been;
My hope I cannot measure,
My path to life is free;
My Saviour has my treasure,
And He will walk with me."
583;In the Bleak Midwinter;;"In the bleak midwinter,
Frosty wind made moan;
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone.
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on snow;
In the bleak midwinter,
Long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold Him,
Nor earth sustain,
Heaven and earth shall flee away
When He comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter
A stable-place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty,
Jesus Christ.

Angels and archangels
May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air.
But His mother only,
In her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the Beloved
With a kiss.

What can I give Him,
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd,
I would bring a lamb.
If I were a wise man,
I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give Him --
Give my heart."
586;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear;;"It came upon a midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
‘Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heaven’s all gracious King!’
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O’er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o’er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

Yet with woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long,
Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong;
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love-song which they bring:
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing.

For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the ever-circling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendours fling,
And all the world send back the song
Which now the angels sing."
587;It is a Thing Most Wonderful;;"It is a thing most wonderful,
Almost too wonderful to be,
That God’s own Son should come from heaven
And die to save a child like me.

And yet I know that it is true;
He came to this poor world below,
And wept, and toiled, and mourned, and died,
Only because He loved us so.

I cannot tell how He could love
A child so weak and full of sin;
His love must be most wonderful,
If He could die my love to win.

It is most wonderful to know
His love for me so free and sure;
But ’tis more wonderful to see
My love for Him so faint and poor.

And yet I want to love Thee, Lord;
O light the flame within my heart,
And I will love Thee more and more,
Until I see Thee as Thou art."
589;Jesus Christ is Risen Today;;"Jesus Christ is risen today; Hallelujah!
Our triumphant holy day; Hallelujah!
Who did once upon the cross; Hallelujah!
Suffer to redeem our loss; Hallelujah!

Hymns of praise then let us sing; Hallelujah!
Unto Christ our heavenly King; Hallelujah!
Who endured the cross and grave; Hallelujah!
Sinners to redeem and save: Hallelujah!

But the pains which He endured; Hallelujah!
Our salvation have procured; Hallelujah!
Now in heaven above He’s King; Hallelujah!
Where the angels ever sing: Hallelujah!"
590;Jesus Lives;;"Jesus lives! thy terrors now
Can, O death, no more appal us;
Jesus lives! by this we know,
Thou, O grave, canst not enthral us.
Hallelujah!

Jesus lives! henceforth is death
But the gate of life immortal;
This shall calm our trembling breath,
When we pass its gloomy portal.
Hallelujah!

Jesus lives! for us He died;
Then, alone to Jesus living,
Pure in heart may we abide,
Glory to our Saviour giving.
Hallelujah!

Jesus lives! our hearts know well,
Naught from us His love shall sever;
Life, nor death, nor powers of hell,
Tear us from His keeping ever.
Hallelujah!

Jesus lives! to Him the throne
Over all the world is given:
May we go where He is gone,
Rest and reign with Him in heaven.
Hallelujah!"

Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high;
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
O receive my soul at last.

Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
False and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace.

Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound,
Make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art;
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity."
592;Jesus Shall Reign;;"Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
Doth his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

For Him shall endless prayer be made,
And praises throng to crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.

People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song,
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name.

Blessings abound where’er He reigns;
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;
The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blessed.

Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honours to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen!"
593;Jesus Stand Among Us;;"Jesus stand among us,
In Thy risen power,
Let this time of worship

Watching for the dawning
Of eternal day."

In hell, or earth, or sky;
Angels and men before it fall,
And devils fear and fly,
And devils fear and fly.

Jesus! the name to sinners dear,
The name to sinners given;
It scatters all their guilty fear,
It turns their hell to heaven,
It turns their hell to heaven.

Jesus! the prisoners’ fetters breaks,
And bruises Satan’s head;
Power into strengthless souls it speaks,
And life into the dead,
And life into the dead.

O that the world might taste and see
The riches of His grace!
The arms of love that compass me
Would all mankind embrace,
Would all mankind embrace.
His only righteousness I show,
His saving grace proclaim;
’Tis all my business here below
To cry: ‘Behold the Lamb!’
To cry: ‘Behold the Lamb!’

Happy if with my latest breath
I might but gasp His name;
Preach Him to all, and cry in death:
‘Behold, behold the Lamb!’
‘Behold, behold the Lamb!’"
595;Join All the Glorious Names;;"Join all the glorious names,
Of wisdom, love, and power,

Too mean to set my Saviour forth.

Great Prophet of my God,
My tongue would bless Thy name:
By Thee the joyful news
Of our salvation came:
The joyful news of sins forgiven,
Of hell subdued and peace with heaven.

Jesus, my great High Priest,
Offered His blood, and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside:
His powerful blood did once atone,
And now it pleads before the throne.

My Saviour and my Lord,
My Conqueror and my King,
Thy sceptre and Thy sword,
Thy reigning grace I sing:
Thine is the power; behold, I sit
In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.

Now let my soul arise,
And tread the tempter down:
My Captain leads me forth
To conquest and a crown.
March on, nor fear to win the day,
Though death and hell obstruct the way.

Should all the hosts of death,
And powers of hell unknown,
Put their most dreadful forms
Of rage and malice on,
I shall be safe; for Christ displays
Superior power and guardian grace."

With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,

Tempted, taunted, yet undaunted,
Through the desert Thou didst go.

Filled the new-made world with light:

Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.

Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry touched the Spirit there.

Traced upon our dial by the sun of love.
We may trust Him fully, all for us to do;
They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true."

Thou art here, we ask not how.

Though the lowliest form doth veil Thee
As of old in Bethlehem,
Here as there Thine angels hail Thee
Branch and Flower of Jesse’s stem.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
We in worship join with them.

Paschal Lamb, Thine offering, finished
Once for all when Thou wast slain,
In its fulness undiminished
Shall forever more remain,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Cleansing souls from every stain.

Life-imparting, heavenly Manna,
Stricken Rock with streaming side,
Heaven and earth with loud hosanna
Worship Thee, the Lamb who died,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Risen, ascended, glorified!"
606;Love Came Down at Christmas;;"Love came down at Christmas,
Love all lovely, Love divine;
Love was born at Christmas,
Star and angels gave the sign.

Worship we the Godhead,
Love Incarnate, Love divine;
Worship we our Jesus:
But wherewith for sacred sign?

Love shall be our token,
Love be yours and love be mine,
Love to God and all men,
Love for plea and gift and sign."
607;Love Divine;;"Love divine, all loves excelling,
Joy of heaven to earth come down!
Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,
All Thy faithful mercies crown.
Jesus, Thou art all compassion,
Pure unbounded love Thou art;
Visit us with Thy salvation,
Enter every trembling heart.

Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit
Into every troubled breast!
Let us all in Thee inherit,
Let us find Thy promised rest.
Take away the love of sinning;
Alpha and Omega be;
End of faith, as its beginning,
Set our hearts at liberty.

Come, Almighty to deliver,
Let us all Thy grace receive;
Suddenly return, and never,
Never more Thy temples leave.
Thee we would be always blessing,
Serve Thee as Thy hosts above,
Pray, and praise Thee without ceasing,
Glory in Thy perfect love.

Finish then Thy new creation,
Pure and spotless let us be;
Let us see Thy great salvation
Perfectly restored in Thee!
Changed from glory into glory,
Till in heaven we take our place;
Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
Lost in wonder, love and praise."
608;Low in The Grave He Lay;;"Low in the grave he lay,
Jesus, my Saviour,
Waiting the coming day,
Jesus, my Lord:

Up from the grave He arose,
With a mighty triumph o’er His foes;
He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
And He lives for ever with His saints to reign:
He arose! He arose!
Alleluia! Christ arose!

Vainly they watch His bed,
Jesus, my Saviour;
Vainly they seal the dead,
Jesus, my Lord:

Death cannot keep his prey,
Jesus, my Saviour;
He tore the bars away,
Jesus, my Lord:"
609;Man of Sorrows;;"Man of sorrows! what a name
For the Son of God, who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim!
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood:
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Guilty, vile, and helpless, we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He:
Full atonement—can it be?
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Lifted up was He to die,
‘It is finished!’ was His cry:
Now in heaven exalted high:
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

When He comes, our glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring,
Then anew this song we’ll sing:
‘Hallelujah! what a Saviour!’"

I am listening, Lord, for Thee;
What hast Thou to say to me?

Speak to me by name, O Master,
Let me know it is to me;
Speak, that I may follow faster,
With a step more firm and free,
Where the Shepherd leads the flock
In the shadow of the rock.

Master, speak! though least and lowest,
Let me not unheard depart;
Master, speak! for O Thou knowest
All the yearning of my heart,
Knowest all its truest need;
Speak and make me blessed indeed.

Master, speak! and make me ready,
When Thy voice is truly heard,
With obedience glad and steady
Still to follow every word.
I am listening, Lord, for Thee;
Master, speak! O speak to me!"

Live in me from day to day,
By His love and power controlling
All I do and say.

May the word  of God dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
Only through His power.

May the peace of God my Father
Rule my life in everything,
That I may be calm to comfort
Sick and sorrowing.
   
May the love of Jesus fill me,
As the waters fill the sea;
Him exalting, self abasing,
This is victory.

May I run the race before me,
Strong and brave to face the foe,
Looking only unto Jesus,
As I onward go."

Thy majesty how bright!
How beautiful Thy mercy-seat,
In depths of burning light!

How dread are Thine eternal years,
O everlasting Lord,
By prostrate spirits day and night
Incessantly adored!

How wonderful, how beautiful
The sight of Thee must be,
Thine endless wisdom, boundless power,
And awesome purity!

O how I fear Thee, living God,
With deepest, tenderest fears,
And worship Thee with trembling hope
And penitential tears!

Yet I may love Thee too, O Lord,
Almighty as Thou art,
For Thou hast stooped to ask of me
The love of my poor heart.

No earthly father loves like Thee;
No mother e’er so mild
Bears and forbears as Thou hast done
With me, Thy sinful child.

Father of Jesus, love’s reward,
What rapture will it be
Prostrate before Thy throne to lie,
And gaze, and gaze on Thee."
614;My Song is Love Unkown;;"My song is love unknown,
My Saviour’s love to me: 
Love to the loveless shown, 
That they might lovely be. 
O who am I, that for my sake 
My Lord should take frail flesh and die?

He came from His blessed throne,
Salvation to bestow; 
But men made strange, and none 
The longed-for Christ would know: 
But O! my Friend, my Friend indeed, 
Who at my need His life did spend.

Sometimes they strew His way, 
And His sweet praises sing; 
Resounding all the day 
Hosannas to their King: 
Then ‘Crucify!’ is all their breath, 
And for His death they thirst and cry.

They rise and needs will have 
My dear Lord made away; 
A murderer they save, 
The Prince of life they slay, 
Yet cheerful He to suffering goes, 
That He His foes from thence might free.

In life no house, no home 
My Lord on earth might have; 
In death, no friendly tomb, 
But what a stranger gave. 
What may I say? Heaven was His home; 
And mine the tomb wherein He lay.

Here might I stay and sing, 
No story so divine; 
Never was love, dear King! 
Never was grief like Thine. 
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise 
I all my days could gladly spend."
615;Now Thank We All Our God;;"Now thank we all our God,
With hearts and hands and voices;

And still is ours today.

O may this bounteous God 
Through all our life be near us, 
With ever joyful hearts 
And blessed peace to cheer us; 
And keep us in His grace, 
And guide us when perplexed, 
And free us from all ills 
In this world and the next.

All praise and thanks to God

Neither in height nor depth to seek:
In nearness shall Thy voice be heard;
Spirit to spirit Thou dost speak.

Christ is our Advocate on high;
Thou art our Advocate within.
O plead the truth, and make reply
To every argument of sin.

But ah, this faithless heart of mine,
The way I know, I know my Guide;
Forgive me, O my Friend divine,
That I so often turn aside.

Be with me when no other friend
The mystery of my heart can share;
And be Thou known, when fears transcend,
By Thy best name of Comforter."

Renewing thought and will and heart: 
Come, love of Christ, afresh to win us,

In ancient times didst give the law 
In cloud, and majesty, and awe.

O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free 
Thine own from Satan’s tyranny; 
From depths of hell Thy people save 
And give them victory o’er the grave.

O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer 
Our spirits by Thine advent here; 
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, 
And death’s dark shadows put to flight.

O come, Thou Key of David, come 
And open wide our heavenly home; 
Make safe the way that leads on high, 
And close the path to misery."
621;O For a Closer Walk With God;;"O for a closer walk with God,
A calm and heavenly frame,
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb.

Where is the blessedness I knew
When I first saw the Lord?
Where is that soul-refreshing view
Of Jesus and His word?

What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
How sweet their memory still!
But they have left an aching void
The world can never fill.

Return, O holy Dove! return,
Sweet messenger of rest!
I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,
And drove Thee from my breast.

The dearest idol I have known,
Whate’er that idol be,
Help me tear if from Thy throne,
And worship only Thee.

So shall my walk be close with God,
Calm and serene my frame;
So purer light shall mark the road
That leads me to the Lamb."

A heart from sin set free; 
A heart that always feels Thy blood 
So freely shed for me;

A heart resigned, submissive, meek, 
My great Redeemer’s throne, 
Where only Christ is heard to speak, 
Where Jesus reigns alone;

A humble, lowly, contrite heart, 
Believing, true, and clean; 
Which neither life nor death can part 
From Him who dwells within;

A heart in every thought renewed, 
And full of love divine; 
Perfect and right, and pure, and good: 
A copy, Lord, of Thine.

Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
Come quickly from above;
Write Thy new name upon my heart,
Thy new best name of love."

My great Redeemer’s praise, 
My great Redeemer’s praise! 
The glories of my God and King, 
The triumphs of His grace!

Jesus! the name that charms our fears, 
That bids our sorrows cease, 
That bids our sorrows cease; 
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears, 
’Tis life, and health, and peace.

See all your sins on Jesus laid; 
The Lamb of God was slain, 
The Lamb of God was slain; 
His soul was once an offering made 
For every soul of man.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin, 
He sets the prisoner free, 
He sets the prisoner free; 
His blood can make the foulest clean, 
His blood availed for me.

He speaks and, listening to His voice, 
New life the dead receive, 
New life the dead receive; 
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice, 
The humble poor believe.

Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb, 
Your loosened tongues employ, 
Your loosened tongues employ; 
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come; 
And leap, ye lame, for joy!

Assist me to proclaim,

The honours of Thy name."

Our hope for years to come, 
Our shelter from the stormy blast,

Under the shadow of Thy throne 
Thy saints have dwelt secure; 
Sufficient is Thine arm alone, 
And our defence is sure.

Before the hills in order stood, 
Or earth received her frame, 
From everlasting Thou art God, 
To endless years the same.

A thousand ages in Thy sight 
Are like an evening gone, 
Short as the watch that ends the night 
Before the rising sun.

Time, like an ever-rolling stream, 
Bears all its sons away; 
They fly forgotten, as a dream 
Dies at the opening day.
O God, our help in ages past, 
Our hope for years to come, 
Be Thou our guard while troubles last, 
And our eternal home."
625;O Jesus I Have Promised;;"O Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end; 
Be Thou forever near me, 
My Master and my Friend; 
I shall not fear the battle 
If Thou art by my side, 
Nor wander from the pathway 
If Thou wilt be my Guide.

O let me feel Thee near me; 
The world is ever near; 
I see the sights that dazzle, 
The tempting sounds I hear; 
My foes are ever near me, 
Around me and within; 
But Jesus, draw Thou nearer, 
And shield my soul from sin.

O let me hear Thee speaking 
In accents clear and still, 
Above the storms of passion, 
The murmurs of self-will; 
O speak to reassure me, 
To hasten, or control; 
O speak, and make me listen, 
Thou Guardian of my soul.

O Jesus, Thou hast promised 
To all who follow Thee 
That where Thou art in glory 
There shall Thy servants be; 
And, Jesus, I have promised 
To serve Thee to the end; 
O give me grace to follow 
My Master and my Friend.

O let me see Thy footmarks, 
And in them plant mine own; 
My hope to follow duly 
Is in Thy strength alone. 
O guide me, call me, draw me, 
Uphold me to the end; 
And then in heaven receive me, 
My Saviour and my Friend."
627;O Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go;;"O love that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in thee: 
I give thee back the life I owe, 
That in thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.

O light that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to thee: 
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in thy sunshine’s blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.

O joy that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to thee:
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain,
That morn shall tearless be.
O cross that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from thee:
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be."
628;Once In Royal David's City;;"Once in royal David's city,
Stood a lowly cattle shed, 
Where a mother laid her baby
In a manger for His bed. 
Mary was that mother mild, 
Jesus Christ, her little child.

He came down to earth from heaven, 
Who is God and Lord of all, 
And His shelter was a stable, 
And His cradle was a stall: 
With the poor and meek and lowly 
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.

And through all His wondrous childhood 
He would honour and obey, 
Love and watch the lowly mother 
In whose gentle arms He lay. 
Christian children all should be 
Mild, obedient, good as He.

For He is our childhood’s pattern: 
Day by day like us He grew; 
He was little, weak and helpless; 
Tears and smiles like us He knew: 
And He feeleth for our sadness, 
And He shareth in our gladness.

And our eyes at last shall see Him 
Through His own redeeming love; 
For that child, so dear and gentle, 
Is our Lord in heaven above; 
And He leads His children on 
To the place where He is gone.

Not in that poor lowly stable, 
With the oxen standing by, 
We shall see Him, but in heaven, 
Set at God’s right hand on high; 
When like stars His children crowned, 
All in white shall wait around."
630;O Praise Ye The Lord;;"O praise ye the Lord!

Praise Him upon earth, 
In tuneful accord, 
Ye sons of new birth; 
Praise Him who hath brought you 
His grace from above, 
Praise Him who hath taught you 
To sing of His love.

O praise ye the Lord, 
All things that give sound; 
Each jubilant chord, 
Re-echo around: 
Loud organs, His glory 
Forthtell in deep tone, 
And sweet harp, the story 
Of what He hath done.

O praise ye the Lord! 
Thanksgiving and song

With grief and pain weighed down, 
How scornfully surrounded 
With thorns, Thine only crown! 
How pale art Thou with anguish, 
With sore abuse and scorn! 
How does that visage languish, 
Which once was bright as morn!

O Lord of life and glory, 
What bliss till now was Thine! 
I read the wondrous story, 
I joy to call Thee mine. 
Thy grief and Thy compassion 
Were all for sinners’ gain; 
Mine, mine was the transgression, 
But Thine the deadly pain.

What language shall I borrow
To praise Thee, heavenly Friend,
For this, Thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end?
Lord, make me Thine for ever,
Nor let me faithless prove;
O let me never, never
Abuse such dying love!

Be near me, Lord, when dying; 
O show Thyself to me;

From Jesus shall not move; 
For he who dies believing,

Of Thy mighty love.

And I come, Lord Jesus; 
Dare I turn away?

Sorrow, sin, and care;
At Thy feet I lay them,
And I leave them there."

Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free;

Leading onward, leading homeward,

O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Spread His praise from shore to shore,
How He loveth, ever loveth,
Changeth never, nevermore;

How He watches o’er His loved ones,
Died to call them all His own;
How for them He intercedeth,
Watches over them from the throne.

O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Love of every love the best:
‘Tis an ocean vast of blessing,
‘Tis a haven sweet of rest.

In humble prayer and fervent praise.

To work, and speak, and think for Thee; 
Still let me guard the holy fire,

O sing of His grace, 
Whose robe is the light, 
Whose canopy space; 
His chariots of wrath 
The deep thunder-clouds form, 
And dark is His path 
On the wings of the storm.

It breathes in the air, 
It shines in the light;

High on His heart He will bear it for thee, 
Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness, 
Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.

Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness 
Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine; 
Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness, 
These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.

These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,
He will accept for the name that is dear;
Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,
Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.

O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,

With gold of obedience and incense of lowliness,

Brothers and sisters, draw near,
Praise Him in glad adoration.

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;
Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee:
Ponder anew
What the Almighty can do,
Who with His love doth befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord, who doth nourish thy life and restore thee,
Fitting thee well for the tasks that are ever before thee,
Then to thy need
He like a mother doth speed,
Spreading the wings of grace o’er thee.

Praise to the Lord, who when tempests their warfare are waging,
Who, when the elements madly around thee are raging,
Biddeth them cease,
Turneth their fury to peace,
Whirlwinds and waters assuaging.

Praise to the Lord, who, when darkness of sin is abounding,
Who, when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding,
Sheddeth His light,
Chaseth the horrors of night,
Saints with His mercy surrounding.

Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him!
Let the Amen
Sound from His people again:
Gladly for aye we adore Him."
642;Praise to the Holiest in the Height;;"Praise to the holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise; 
In all His words most wonderful, 
Most sure in all His ways.

O loving wisdom of our God! 
When all was sin and shame, 
A second Adam to the fight 
And to the rescue came.
O wisest love! that flesh and blood, 
Which did in Adam fail, 
Should strive afresh against the foe, 
Should strive and should prevail;

And that a higher gift than grace 
Should flesh and blood refine,
God’s presence and His very self, 
And essence all-divine.

O generous love! that He, who smote 
In Man for man the foe, 
The double agony in Man 
For man should undergo;

And in the garden secretly, 
And on the cross on high, 
Should teach His brethren, and inspire 
To suffer and to die.

Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And to the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways."
643;Rejoice the Lord is King;;"Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore; 
Mortals, give thanks, and sing, 
And triumph ever more:

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; 
Rejoice! Again I say: rejoice!

Jesus the Saviour reigns, 
The God of truth and love;
When He had purged our stains, 
He took His seat above:

His kingdom cannot fail, 
He rules o’er earth and heaven; 
The keys of death and hell 
Are to our Jesus given:

He sits at God’s right hand 
Till all His foes submit, 
And bow to His command, 
And fall beneath His feet:

Rejoice in glorious hope; 
Jesus the Judge shall come, 
And take His servants up 
To their eternal home:

We soon shall hear the archangel’s voice;
The trump of God shall sound: rejoice!"
644;Ride on Ride on in Majesty;;"Ride on, ride on in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die! 
O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin 
O’er captive death and conquered sin.

Ride on, ride on in majesty! 
Hark all the tribes ‘hosanna’ cry; 
Thine humble beast pursues his road 
With palms and scattered garments strowed.

Ride on, ride on in majesty! 
Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh; 
The Father on His sapphire throne 
Expects His own anointed Son.

Ride on, ride on in majesty! 
In lowly pomp ride on to die! 
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain, 
Then take, O God, Thy power, and reign!"
645;Rock of Ages;;"Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in Thee; 
Let the water and the blood, 
From Thy riven side which flowed, 
Be of sin the double cure, 
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

Not the labour of my hands 
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands; 
Could my zeal no respite know, 
Could my tears forever flow, 
All for sin could not atone: 
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring, 
Simply to Thy cross I cling; 
Naked, come to Thee for dress; 
Helpless, look to Thee for grace; 
Foul, I to the fountain fly: 
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath, 
When mine eyes shall close in death, 
When I soar to worlds unknown, 
See Thee on Thy judgement throne, 
Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in Thee."
646;See Amid the Winter's Snow;;"See, amid the winter's snow,
Born for us on earth below,

Hail, thou ever-blessed morn! 
Hail, redemption’s happy dawn! 
Sing through all Jerusalem:
Christ is born in Bethlehem!

Lo, within a manger lies
He who built the starry skies,
He who throned in height sublime
Sits amid the cherubim.

Say, ye holy shepherds, say, 
What your joyful news today; 
Wherefore have ye left your sheep 
On the lonely mountain steep?

‘As we watched at dead of night, 
Lo, we saw a wondrous light: 
Angels singing, “Peace on earth” 
Told us of the Saviour’s birth.’

Sacred Infant, all divine, 
What a tender love was Thine, 
Thus to come from highest bliss 
Down to such a world as this!

Teach, O teach us, holy Child, 
By Thy face so meek and mild, 
Teach us to resemble Thee 
In Thy sweet humility."

Sleeps the world; hid from sight, 
Mary and Joseph in stable bare 
Watch o’er the Child beloved and fair, 
Sleeping in heavenly rest, 
Sleeping in heavenly rest.

Silent night, holy night! 
Shepherds first saw the light, 
Heard resounding clear and long, 
Far and near, the angel-song: 
‘Christ the Redeemer is here, 
Christ the Redeemer is here.’

Silent night, holy night! 
Son of God, O how bright 
Love is smiling from Thy face! 
Strikes for us now the hour of grace, 
Saviour, since Thou art born, 
Saviour, since Thou art born."
649;Soldiers of Christ Arise;;"Soldiers of Christ, arise,
And put your armour on; 
Strong in the strength which God supplies, 
Through His eternal Son;

Strong in the Lord of hosts, 
And in His mighty power; 
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts 
Is more than conqueror.

Stand, then, in His great might,
With all His strength endued;
And take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God.

Leave no unguarded place, 
No weakness of the soul; 
Take every virtue, every grace, 
And fortify the whole.

From strength to strength go on, 
Wrestle and fight and pray; 
Tread all the powers of darkness down, 
And win the well-fought day.

That having all things done, 
And all your conflicts past, 
Ye may o’ercome, through Christ alone, 
And stand complete at last."
650;Take my Life and Let it Be;;"Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee; 
Take my moments and my days, 
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

Take my hands, and let them move 
At the impulse of Thy love; 
Take my feet, and let them be 
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice, and let me sing 
Always, only, for my King; 
Take my lips, and let them be 
Filled with messages from Thee.

Take my silver and my gold, 
Not a mite would I withhold; 
Take my intellect, and use 
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will, and make it Thine; 
It shall be no longer mine: 
Take my heart, it is Thine own; 
It shall be Thy royal throne.

Take my love; my Lord, I pour 
At Thy feet its treasure store: 
Take myself, and I will be 
Ever, only, all for Thee."
652;The Day Thou Gavest Lord;;"The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended,
The darkness falls at Thy behest;
To Thee our morning hymns ascended,
Thy praise shall sanctify our rest.

We thank Thee that Thy church unsleeping,
While earth rolls onward into light,
Through all the world her watch is keeping,
And rests not now by day or night.

As o’er each continent and island
The dawn leads on another day,
The voice of prayer is never silent,
Nor dies the strain of praise away.

The sun that bids us rest is waking
Our brethren ’neath the western sky,
And hour by hour fresh lips are making
Thy wondrous doings heard on high.

So be it, Lord! Thy throne shall never,
Like earth’s proud empires, pass away;
Thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever,
Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway."
653;The First Nowell;;"The first nowell the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep.

Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with His blood mankind hath bought."
654;The God of Abraham Praise;;"The God of Abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of everlasting days, and God of love.
Jehovah! Great I AM!
By earth and heaven confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred name forever blessed.

The God of Abraham praise,
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise, and seek the joys at His right hand.
I all on earth forsake --
Its wisdom, fame, and power --
And Him my only portion make, my shield and tower.

The God of Abraham praise,
Whose all-sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my happy days in all my ways.
He calls a worm His friend,
He calls Himself my God;
And He shall save me to the end through Jesu’s blood.

He by Himself hath sworn,
I on His oath depend:
I shall, on eagles’ wings upborne, to heaven ascend;
I shall behold His face,
I shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace forever more.

There dwells the Lord our King,
The Lord our Righteousness,
Triumphant o’er the world and sin, the Prince of Peace;
On Zion’s sacred height
His kingdom still maintains,
And glorious with His saints in light forever reigns.

The God who reigns on high
The great archangels sing;
And, holy, holy, holy, cry, Almighty King.
Who was and is the same,
And ever more shall be;
Jehovah, Father, Great I AM, we worship Thee.

Before the Saviour’s face
The ransomed nations bow;
O’erwhelmed at His almighty grace, forever new:
He shows His prints of love,
They kindle to a flame,
And sound through all the worlds above the slaughtered Lamb.

The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high;
Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! They ever cry.
Hail, Abraham’s God, and mine!
I join the heavenly lays;  All might and majesty 
are Thine, and endless praise."

Is crowned with glory now;
A royal diadem adorns
The mighty Victor’s brow.

The highest place that heaven affords
Is His by sovereign right,
The King of kings, the Lord of lords,
And heaven’s eternal light.

The joy of all who dwell above,
The joy of all below,
To whom He manifests His love,
And grants His name to know.

To them the cross, with all its shame,
With all its grace, is given;
Their name an everlasting name,
Their joy the joy of heaven.

They suffer with their Lord below,
They reign with Him above;
Their profit and their joy to know
The mystery of His love.

The cross He bore is life and health,
Though shame and death to Him;
His people’s hope, His people’s wealth,
Their everlasting theme."
656;The King of Love;;"The King of Love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never;
I nothing lack if I am His
And He is mine forever.

Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth,
And where the verdant pastures grow
With food celestial feedeth.

Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
But yet in love He sought me,
And on His shoulder gently laid,
And home rejoicing brought me.

!n death’s dark vale I fear no ill
With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
Thy cross before to guide me.

Thou spread’st a table in my sight;
Thy unction grace bestoweth:
And O what transport of delight
From Thy pure chalice floweth!

And so through all the length of days
Thy goodness faileth never;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forever."
657;The Lord Has Given;;"The Lord has given a land of good things,

And in His kingdom I will shine.

With the high praises of God in our mouth
And a two-edged sword in our hand,
We’ll march right on to the victory side,
Right into Canaan’s land.

Gird up your armour, ye sons of Zion,
Gird up your armour, let’s go to war.
We’ll win the battle with great rejoicing,
And so we’ll praise Him more and more.

We’ll bind their kings in chains and fetters,
We’ll bind their nobles tight in iron,
To execute God’s written judgement;
March on to glory, sons of Zion!"
658;The Lord's my Shepherd;;"The Lord's my shepherd I’ll not want;
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again;
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
E’en for His own name’s sake.

Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill;
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me;
And in God’s house forever more
My dwelling place shall be."

Shouts of joy."
660;There is a Green Hill Far Away;;"There is a green hill far away,
Outside a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.

We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear;
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there.

He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heaven,
Saved by His precious blood.

There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of heaven, and let us in.

O dearly, dearly has He loved!
And we must love Him too,
And trust in His redeeming blood,
And try His works to do."
661;There is a Name I Love to Hear;;"There is a name I love to hear,
I love to speak its worth;
It sounds like music in my ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

O, how I love the Saviour’s name,
O, how I love the Saviour’s name,
O, how I love the Saviour’s name,
The sweetest name on earth.

It tells me of a Saviour’s love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner’s perfect plea.

It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in my sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.

It bids my trembling heart rejoice,
It dries each rising tear;
It tells me in a still, small voice
To trust and never fear.

Jesus, the name I love so well,
The name I love to hear!
No saint on earth its worth can tell,
No heart conceive how dear!"
662;The Virgin Had a Baby Boy;;"The Virgin Mary had a baby boy,
The Virgin Mary had a baby boy,

He come from the glorious kingdom.
Oh, yes! believer.
Oh, yes! believer.
He come from the glory,
He come from the glorious kingdom.

The angels sang when the baby was born,
The angels sang when the baby was born,
The angels sang when the baby was born,
And proclaiming Him the Saviour Jesus.

The wise men saw where the baby was born,
And they saw that His name was Jesus."

Rolled the stone away,
Kept the folded grave-clothes
Where Thy body lay.

Thine be the glory,
Risen, conquering Son;
Endless is the victory
Thou o’er death hast won!

Lo, Jesus meets us,
Risen from the tomb!
Lovingly He greets us,
Scatters fear and gloom.
Let the church with gladness
Hymns of triumph sing,
For her Lord now liveth,
Death hath lost its sting.

No more we doubt Thee,
Glorious Prince of life;
Life is naught without Thee:
Aid us in our strife;
Make us more than conquerors,
Through Thy deathless love;
Lead us in Thy triumph
To Thy home above."
664;Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne;;"Thou didst Leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem’s home there was found no room
For Thy holy nativity:
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Heaven’s arches rang when the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth cam’st Thou, Lord, on earth,
And in great humility,
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee.

The foxes found rest, and the birds had their nest,
In the shade of the cedar tree;
But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee.
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee.
Thou camest, O Lord, with the living word
That should set Thy children free;
But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary.
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
Thy cross is my only plea.

When heaven’s arches shall ring, and her choirs shall sing,
At Thy coming to victory,
Let Thy voice call me home, saying, ‘Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee.’
And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest for me."

And took their flight;

On Thy redeeming wing,
Healing and sight;
Health to the sick in mind,
Sight to the inly blind,

Life-giving, holy Dove,
Speed forth Thy flight;
Move on the waters’ face,
Bearing the lamp of grace,
And in earth’s darkest place

Boundless as ocean’s tide
Rolling in fullest pride,

In trouble and in joy,
The praises of my God shall still
My heart and tongue employ.

Of His deliverance I will boast,
Till all that are distressed
From my example comfort take,
And charm their griefs to rest.

O magnify the Lord with me,
With me exalt His name;
When in distress to Him I called,
He to my rescue came.

The hosts of God encamp around
The dwellings of the just;
Deliverance He affords to all
Who on His succour trust.

O make but trial of His love;
Experience will decide
How blest are they, and only they,
Who in His truth confide.

Have nothing else to fear;
Make you His service your delight;

Thy flock, from age to age;

Full clear on every page.
Our fathers owned Thy goodness,
And we their deeds record;

Thy heralds brought glad tidings
To greatest as to least;
They bade them rise and hasten
To share the great King’s feast.
And this was all their teaching
In every deed and word;
To all alike proclaiming:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.

Through many a day of darkness,
Through many a scene of strife,
The faithful few fought bravely
To guard the nation’s life.
Their gospel of redemption,
Sin pardoned, man restored,
Was all in this enfolded:
One Church, one Faith, one Lord.

Thy mercy will not fail us,
Nor leave Thy work undone;
With Thy right hand to help us,
The victory shall be won.

Thy name shall be adored,
And this shall be their anthem:

All good gifts around us
Are sent from heaven above;
Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord,
For all His love.

He only is the Maker
Of all things near and far;
He paints the wayside flower,
He lights the evening star;
The winds and waves obey Him,
By Him the birds are fed;
Much more to us, His children,
He gives our daily bread.

We thank Thee, then, O Father,
For all things bright and good;

Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;
We rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go.

We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!

The babe, the Son of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own Him;

Their voice in hymns of praise:

In joyful notes resound:

Let air, and sea, and sky,
From depth to height, reply:

Is born of David’s line 
A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, 
And this shall be the sign.

‘The heavenly babe you there shall find 
To human view displayed, 
All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands, 
And in a manger laid.’

Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith 
Appeared a shining throng

And on the earth be peace;

If it had not been for Jesus
Oh where would I be
I've been happy since 
The Lord brought me out.

I've been shouting since 
The Lord brought me out.
I've been shouting since 
The Lord brought me out.
If it had not been for Jesus

I've been shouting since 
The Lord brought me out.

I've been singing since 
The Lord brought me out.
I've been singing since 
The Lord brought me out.

The Lord brought you out?
If it had not been for Jesus
Oh where would I be
Aren't you glad that 
The Lord brought you out?"
953;Not What I Wish To Be;Bb;"Not what I wish to be,
Nor where I wish to go,
For who am I
That I should choose my way?
The Lord shall choose for me;
'Tis better far I know.
So let Him bid me go or stay."
954;After All;C;"After all this life is over
And our burdens have been lifted
And we stand upon 
The mountain top so tall.
Looking over in that city
That the Saviour is preparing
Gives me faith that I can 
Make it after all."
955;Bless The Lord, Oh My Soul;F;"Bless the Lord, Oh, my soul,

Lord in Thy presence there's 
     healing divine;
No other power can save, 
     Lord, but Thine.

Holy Spirit Thou art welcome 
     in this place,
Thou art welcome in this place.

Fill all the hungry, 
    and empty within;
Restore us, oh Father, 
     revive us again.

Holy Spirit, Thou art welcome 
    in this place,
Thou art welcome in this place."
957;I'm Going Home;Ab;"I'm going home,
On the road home.
Going back to God where I belong.

Glory to God!  I'll see His face!
I'm going back to God
Where I belong."

and cried ""Holy, Holy, Holy"";
I clapped my hands and sang ""Glory,
Glory to the Son of God!"""
959;Only Believe;C;"Fear not, little flock, 
From the Cross to the Throne;
From death into life 
He went for His own;
All power in earth, 
All power above,
Is given to Him 
For the flock of His love.

Only believe, only believe,
All things are possible, only believe;
Only believe, only believe,
All things are possible, only believe.

     (Lord, I believe...)
     (Lord, I receive...)
     (Jesus is here...)

Fear not, little flock, 
He goeth ahead,
Your shepherd selecteth 
The path you must tread;
The waters of Marah 
He'll sweeten for thee,
He drank all the bitter 
In Gethsemane.

Fear not, little flock, 
What ever your lot,
He enters all rooms,
The doors being shut;
He never forsakes, 
He never is gone,
So count on His presence 
In darkness and dawn."
961;Hallelujah, We Shall Rise;F;"In the resurrection morning,
When the trump of God shall sound,
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise!

And no tears will e'er be found,
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise.
---[Chorus:1]---
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!)
We shall rise! (Amen!)
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!)
In the resurrection morning,
When death's prison bars are broken,
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise.

In the resurrection morning,
What a meeting it will be,
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise!
When our fathers and our mothers,
And our loved ones we shall see,
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise.

In the resurrection morning,
Blessed thought it is to me,
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise!
I shall see my blessed Saviour,
Who so freely died for me,
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise.

In the resurrection morning.
We shall meet Him in the air,
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise.
And be carried up to glory,
To our home so bright and fair,
We shall rise, (Hallelujah!) we shall rise."
962;Teach Me, Lord, To Wait;F;"Teach me, Lord, to wait 
Down on my knees,
Till in Your own good time 
You answer my pleas;
Teach me not to rely 
On what others do,
But to wait in prayer 
For an answer from You.

They that wait upon the Lord,
Shall renew their strength,
They shall mount up with wings 
     as eagles,

They shall run and not be weary, 
They shall walk and not faint;
Teach me, Lord, 
Teach me, Lord, to wait.

Teach me, Lord, to wait 
While hearts are aflame,
Help me humble my pride 
And call on Your Name;
Keep my faith renewed, 
Keep my eyes on Thee,
Help me be on this earth 
What You want me to be."
963;Marvelous Grace;F;"Marvelous Grace Of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds Our sin and our guilt.
Yonder on Calvary's Mount outpoured,
There where the Blood Of the Lamb was spilt.

Grace, Grace, God's Grace,
Grace that will pardon 
And cleanse within;
Grace, Grace, God's Grace,
Grace that is greater 
Than all our sin.

Sin and despair Like the sea waves cold, 
Threaten the soul With infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, Yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge, The Mighty Cross.

Dark is the stain That we cannot hide,
What can avail To wash it away?
Look! there is flowing A crimson tide;
Whiter than snow You may be today.

Marvelous, infinite, Matchless grace,
Freely bestowed On all who believe!
You that are longing To see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?"
964;When The Redeemed are Gathering in;F;"I am thinking of the rapture 
In our blessed home on high.
When the redeemed are gathering in;
How we'll raise the heavenly anthem 
In that city in the sky,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

When the redeemed are gathering in,
Washed like snow, 
And free from all sin;
How we'll shout, 
And how we'll sing,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

There will be a great procession 
Over on the streets of gold,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Oh what music, Oh what singing, 
O'er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption's story 
With their voices clear and strong,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Then the angels all will listen, 
For they cannot join that song,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Then the Saviour will give orders 
To prepare the banquet board,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
And we'll hear His invitation, 
""Come, ye blessed of the Lord,""
When the redeemed are gathering in."
966;Oh How I Love Jesus (---[Chorus:1]--- Only);F;"Oh how I love Jesus,
Oh how I love Jesus,

He will never forsake me,
He will never forsake me,
He will never forsake me,
Because He first loved me."
967;Fill My Way With Love;F;"Let me walk, Blessed Lord
In the way Thou hast gone
Leading straight to the land above
Giving cheer everywhere
To the sad and the lone,
Fill my way every day with Love

Fill my way every day with Love
As I walk with the heavenly Dove
Let me go all the while
With a song and a smile
Fill my way every day with Love

Keep me close to the side of 
My Saviour and Guide
Let me never in darkness rove
Keep my path free from wrath
And my soul satisfied
Fill my way every day with Love

Soon the race will be o'er
And I'll travel no more
But abide in my home above
Let me sing, Blessed King
all the way to the shore
Fill my way every day with Love"
968;I Love Him;C;"Gone from my heart the world
     and all its charms;
Now, through the Blood, 
     I'm saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart 
     is bending low;
The precious Blood of Jesus 
     cleanses white as snow.

I love Him, I love Him
Because He first Loved me
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary's tree.

Once I was lost, and 'way 
     down deep in sin,
Once was a slave to passions 
     fierce within;
Once was afraid to trust
     a loving God;
But now I'm cleansed from every 
     stain through Jesus' Blood.

Once I was bound, but now 
     I am set free;
Once, I was blind, but now 
     the Light I see;
Once I was dead, but now 
     in Christ I live,
To tell the world around 
     the peace that He doth give."
969;Zion's Hill;F;"There waits for me 
     a glad tomorrow,
Where gates of pearl swing 
     open wide,
And when I've passed this 
     vale of sorrow,
I'll camp upon the other side.
---[Chorus:1]---
Some day beyond the reach 
     of mortal ken,
Some day, God only knows 
Just where and when,
The wheels of mortal life 
Shall all stand still,
And I shall go to dwell 
     on Zion's hill.

Some day I'll hear the 
     angels singing,
Beyond the shadows 
     of the tomb;
And all the bells of 
     heaven ringing,
While saints are singing, 
""Home, Sweet Home.""

Some day my labours will 
     be ended,
And all my wand'rings 
     will be o'er,
And all earth's broken ties 
     be mended,
And I shall sigh and weep 
     no more.

Some day the dark clouds 
     will be rifted,
And all the night of gloom 
     be past;
And all life's burdens 
     will be lifted,
The day of rest shall 
     dawn at last."
970;I Shall Not Be Moved;F;"Jesus is my Saviour, 
I shall not be moved;
In His Love and favour, 
I shall not be moved;

Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

(I shall not be, 
I shall not be moved) x 2

Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In my Christ abiding, 
I shall not be moved;
In His Love I'm hiding, 
I shall not be moved;

Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

If I trust Him ever, 
I shall not be moved:
He will fail me never, 
I shall not be moved;

Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

On His Word I'm feeding, 
I shall not be moved,
He's the One that's leading, 
I shall not be moved,

Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In His Love abiding, 
I shall not be moved;
And in Him confiding, 
I shall not be moved:

Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though all hell assail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Jesus will not fail me, 
I shall not be moved;

Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though the tempest rages, 
I shall not be moved,
On the Rock of Ages, 
I shall not be moved;

Just like a tree that's planted 
     by the waters,
I shall not be moved."
971;I Feel Like Travelling On;F;"My heavenly home 
Is bright and fair,
I feel like travelling on, 
No pain, nor death 
Can enter there,
I feel like travelling on.

Yes, I feel like travelling on,
I feel like travelling on;
My heavenly home 
Is bright and fair,
I feel like travelling on.

Its glittering towers 
  the sun outshine,
I feel like travelling on;
That heavenly mansion 
     shall be mine,
I feel like travelling on.

Let others seek a home below,
I feel like travelling on;
Which flames devour, 
Or waves o'erflow,
I feel like travelling on.

The Lord has been so 
     good to me,
I feel like travelling on;
Until that blessed home I see,
I feel like travelling on."
972;I Am Marked;Ab;"I have lost my reputation 
Since I turned my back on sin,
And a lot of friends went from me 
Since I let my Saviour in;
Now they pass me by unknown, 
When they once passed with a smile;
Now they say I'm very foolish, 
And they say I'm out of style.

I am marked, marked, marked,
I am marked, now wherever I go;
I am marked, marked, marked,
Just what I am everyone seems to know.

I am sealed, sealed, sealed,
I am sealed by His Spirit Divine;
Oh glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen!
I am His and I know that He is mine.

Well, they say my life is ruined, 
And my talent thrown away,
And they cannot understand it, 
For I had such plans one day;
But I know what I surrendered 
When I promised I'd go through;
And I gained far more glory 
Since God made me over new."
973;Wings Of A Dove;C;"Noah had drifted
On the floods many days
He searched for land
In various ways

Troubles he had some,
But not from above,
God gave him His sign
On the wings of a dove.

On the wings of a snow-white dove,
God sends His pure, sweet Love,
A sign from above, 
On the wings of a dove.

Jesus, our Saviour
Came to earth one day;
He was born in a stable,
In a manger of hay;

Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign,
On the wings of a dove.

Though I have suffered
In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;

Faith wasn't forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign
On the wings of a dove.

The Bride in her anguish,
Awaiting the claim,
Of her Loved-One and Saviour,
Who is Jesus by name.

Though she be rejected
But not from above,
God sends downHis love,
On the wings of a dove."
974;Beyond The Sunset;Eb;"Beyond the sunset, 
Oh blissful morning,
When with our Saviour 
Heaven is begun.
Earth's toiling ended, 
Oh glorious dawning;
Beyond the sunset, 
When day is done.

Beyond the sunset 
No clouds will gather,
No storms will threaten, 
No fears annoy.
Oh day of gladness, 
Oh day unending;
Beyond the sunset, 
Eternal joy.

Beyond the sunset, 
A hand will guide me
To God, the Father, 
Whom I adore;
His glorious Presence, 
His words of welcome,
Will be my portion 
On that fair shore.

Beyond the sunset, 
Oh glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones 
Who've gone before.
In that fair homeland 
We'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset 
Forevermore."
975;Shall We Gather At The River;C;"Shall we gather at the river, 
Where bright angel feet have trod,
With its crystal tide forever,
Flowing from the throne of God.
---[Chorus:1]---
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river;
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows from the throne of God.

On the bosom of the river,
Where the Saviour-King we own,
We shall meet and sorrow never,
'Neath the glory of the throne.

On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy, golden day.

Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

At the smiling of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour's face,
Saints whom death will never sever
Lift their songs of saving grace.

Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace."
976;Must Jesus Bear Alone?;G;"Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for every one,
And there's a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I'll bear,
Till death shall set me free,
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there's a crown for me.

Upon the crystal pavement, down
At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,.
And His dear name repeat.

Oh precious cross! Oh glorious crown!
Oh resurrection day!
Ye angels from the stars come down
And bear my soul away."
977;Won't It Be Wonderful?;F;"When with the Saviour 
We enter the gloryland,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Ended the troubles 
and cares of the storyland,
Won't it be wonderful there?
---[Chorus:1]---
Won't it be wonderful there?
Having no burdens to bear?
Joyously singing 
With heart-bells all ringing,
Oh won't it be wonderful there?

Walking and talking with Christ, 
The supernal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Praising, adoring the matchless 
Eternal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?

There where the tempest 
Will never be sweeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Sure that forever the Lord 
Will be  keeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?"
978;When I Reach That City;F;"On the top of Mount Zion is a city
And the earth with glory it doth fill;
I shall look on its beauty in the 
     morning
When I reach that city on the hill.
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh, that city on Mount Zion,
Tho' a pilgrim, yet I love thee still;
I'll not leave thee, through the ages,
When I reach that city on the hill.

I'm invited to come home to that city,
For the Word says, ""Whosoever will,""
And I'll find there a mansion for me
     waiting
When I reach that city on the hill.

Death will never molest me in that city,
Never leave me lying cold and chill;
And I'll enter to live up there forever
When I reach that city on the hill.

So I'll stay here until my Saviour 
     calls me,
Trying daily to perform His will;
Then He'll say unto me, ""Well done,""
     up yonder
When I reach that city on the hill."
979;I am resolved;Ab;"I am resolved no longer to linger,
Charmed by the world's delight;
Things that are higher, 
     things that are nobler,
These have allured my sight.
---[Chorus:1]---
I will hasten to Him,
Hasten so glad and free,
Jesus, greatest, highest,
I will come to Thee.

I am resolved to go to the Saviour, 
Leaving my sin and strife;
He is the true One, 
He is the just One,
He hath the words of life.

I am resolved to follow the Saviour,
Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He sayeth, 
Do what He willeth,
He is the living way.

I am resolved to enter the kingdom,
Leaving the paths of sin;
Friends may oppose me, 
Foes may beset me
Still will I enter in.

I am resolved, and who will go with me?
Come, friends, without delay,
Taught by the Bible, led by the Spirit,
We'll walk the heavenly way."
980;Jesus Is The One;F;"Jesus is the one,

That I may see
Glimpses of truth 
Thou hast for me;
Place in my hands 
The wonderful key
That shall unclasp, 
And set me free.

Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit Divine!

Open my ears, 
That I may hear
Voices of truth 
Thou sendest clear;
And while the wave-notes 
Fall on my ear,
Everything false 
Will disappear,

Open my mouth, 
And let me bear
Gladly the warm 
Truth everywhere;
Open my heart, 
And let me prepare,
Love with Thy children 
Thus to share."
982;The Love Of God;C;"The Love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell.

The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

Oh, Love of God, 
How rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints and angels song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;

God's Love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race,
The saints and angels' song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;

To write the Love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."
983;The Meeting In The Air;Bb;"There is going to be a meeting in the air.
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you, greet you over there
In that home beyond the sky;

'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son will be the leading One
At the meeting in the air."
984;The Old Time Religion;G;"It's the old-time Holy Spirit,
And the devil won't go near It,
That's the reason people fear It;
But it's good enough for me.
---[Chorus:1]---
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
It's good enough for me.

It will make you stop your lying;
It will save you when you're dying;
It will start the devil flying;
And It's good enough for me.

It's so good I want no other,
For It makes me love my brother;
And It brings things from under 
     cover,
And It's good enough for me.

(It was good in the fiery furnace...)
(It was good for Paul and Silas...)
(It was good for Brother Branham...)
(It will take us all to Heaven...)"
985;Jesus, The Light;Eb;"All ye saints of light proclaim,

We'll walk in the light, Beautiful light,
Come where the dewdrops 
    of mercy are bright;
Shine all around us by day and by night,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Hear the Saviour's earnest call,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Send the Gospel truth to all,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Why not seek Him then today,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Go with truth the narrow way,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Come, confess Him as your King, 
Jesus, the light of the world;
Then the bells of heaven will ring,
Jesus, the light of the world."
987;Have Thine Own Way, Lord;F;"Have Thine own way, Lord!

While I am waiting, 
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me,
Master, today!

Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in thy Presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray!

Power, all power,
Surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o'er my being
Absolute sway!

Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me."
988;When we're inside the gates of pearl;F;"When we're inside the gates of pearl,
We'll learn a lot of things,
We'll have a harp that's made of gold,
Perhaps a thousand strings;
We'll sing and shout and dance about,
The Lamb will dry our tears;
We'll have a grand homecoming week,
The first ten thousand years."
989;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot;F;"I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home;
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

Swing low, sweet chariot, 
Coming for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do,
Coming for to carry me home;
Tell all my friends I'm a-coming too,
Coming for to carry me home."
990;Peace In The Valley;C;"Well, I'm tired and so weary, 
But I must go along;
Till the Lord comes and calls 
Me away, oh, yes;
Well the morning is bright 
And the Lamb is the Light;
And the night, night is as fair 
As the day, oh yes.
---[Chorus:1]---
There will be peace in the valley 
For me some day;
There will be peace in the valley 
For me, oh, Lord, I pray;
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow,
     no trouble I'll see;
There will be peace 
In the valley for me.

There the flow'rs will be blooming, 
And the grass will be green;
And the skies will be clear 
And serene, oh, yes;
Well the sun ever beams, 
In this valley of dreams;
And no clouds there will ever 
Be seen,oh, yes.

Well, the bear will be gentle, 
And the wolf will be tame;
And the lion shall lay down 
By the lamb, oh, yes;
Well the beast from the wild, 
Shall be led by a little child;
And I'll be changed, changed 
From this creature that I am, oh, yes."
991;Wonderful;F;"Oh my heart sings today, 
Sings for joy and gladness,
Jesus saves, satisfies, 
Banishes my sadness;
Guilt is gone, peace is mine, 
Peace like to a river,
Jesus is wonderful,

Wonderful, wonderful, 
Jesus is to me,
Counselor, Prince of Peace, 
Mighty God is He;

Saving me, keeping me 
From all sin and shame,
Wonderful is my Redeemer,

Once was lost, now I'm found, 
Free from condemnation,
Jesus gives liberty 
And a full salvation;
Saving me, keeping me,
From all sin and shame,
Wonderful is my Redeemer,
Praise His name.

Living here with my Lord 
In a holy union,
Day by day, all the way 
Holding sweet communion;
Oh what change grace hath wrought 
In my lowly station!
Since my soul has received 
Full and free salvation."

---[Chorus:1]---
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name;
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

If my heart is right when He calls me,
If my heart is right I will hear;
If my heart is right when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

If my robe is white when He calls me,
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name."
993;Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus;F;"O soul are you weary and troubled
No light in the darkness you see
There's light for a look at the Saviour
And life more abundant and free

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of the earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace

His Word shall not fail you, He promised
Believe Him and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell"
994;A Child Of The King;Eb;"My Father is rich in 
     houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of 
      the world in His hands!

Of rubies and diamonds, 
      of silver and gold
His coffers are full, 
     He has riches untold.

I'm a child of the King!
A child of the King!
With Jesus my Saviour,
I'm a child of the King!

My Father's own Son, 
      the Saviour of men,
Once wandered o'er earth 
     as the poorest of  them;

But now He is reigning 
     forever on high,
And will give me a home 
     in heav'n by and by.

I once was an outcast, 
     stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, 
     and an alien by birth!

But I've been adopted, 
     my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, 
     a robe, and a crown.

A tent or a cottage, 
     why should I care?
They're building a palace 
     for me over there!

Though exiled from home, 
     yet still I may sing:
All glory to God, 
I'm a child of the King!"
995;Battle Hymn Of The Republic;Bb;"Mine eyes have seen the glory 
     of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;

He hath loosed the fateful lightning
   of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet 
     that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
     before His judgement seat;

Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
     be jubilant, my feet! 
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
     Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
     that transfigures you and me;

As He died to make men holy,
     let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on."
996;The Unveiled Christ;C;"Once our blessed Christ of beauty, 
Was veiled off from human view;
But through suff'ring, 
     death and sorrow,
He has rent the veil in two.
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh behold the man of sorrows,
Oh behold Him in plain view,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due,
For He is the well beloved,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Throughout time and endless ages,
Heights and depths of love so true,
He alone can be the giver,
Since He rent the veil in two."
997;Hold To God's Hand;F;"Time is filled with swift transition,
Naught of earth unmoved can stand,
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging Hand!

Hold to God's unchanging Hand!
Hold to God's unchanging Hand!
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging Hand!

Trust in Him who will not leave you,
Whatsoever years may bring,
If by earthly friends forsaken,
Still more closely to Him cling!

Covet not this world's vain riches,
That so rapidly decay,
Seek to gain the heavenly treasures,
They will never pass away!

When your journey is completed,
And to God you have been true,
Fair and bright the home in glory,
Your enraptured soul will view!"
999;The Lifeboat;F;"We're floating down the stream of time,
We have not long to stay;
The stormy clouds of darkness
Will turn to brightest day.
Then let us all take courage,
For we're not left alone;
The lifeboat soon is coming
To gather the Jewels home.

Then cheer, my brother, cheer,
Our trial will soon be o'er,
Our loved ones we shall meet, shall meet,
Upon the golden shore.
We're pilgrims and we're strangers here,
We're seeking a city to come,
The lifeboat soon is coming,
To gather the Jewels home.

Sometimes the Devil tempts me,
And says it's all in vain
To try to live a Christian life
And walk in Jesus' name;
But then we hear the Master say,
""I'll lend you a helping hand,
And if you'll only trust Me,
I'll guide you to the land.""

The lifeboat soon is coming,
By eyes of faith I see
As she sweeps through the waters
To rescue you and me,
And land us safely in the port
With friends we love so dear.
""Get ready,"" cries the Captain;
""Oh, look, she's almost here.""

Oh, now's the time to get on board,
While she is passing by;
But if you stand and wait too long, 
You shall forever die;
The fare is paid for one and all,
The Captain bids you come,
And get on board the lifeboat,
She'll carry you safely home."
1000;Down From His Glory;Eb;"Down from His glory, 
Ever living story,
My God and Saviour came, 
And Jesus was His Name.

Born in a manger, 
To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, 
Tears and agony.

Oh how I love Him!  
How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, 
My all in all!

The great Creator 
Became my Saviour,
And all God's fullness 
Dwelleth in Him.

What condescension, 
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night, 
Not one faint hope in sight;

God, gracious, tender, 
Laid aside His splendour,
Stooping to woo, to win, 
To save my soul.

Without reluctance, 
Flesh and Blood His substance,
He took the form of man, 
Revealed the hidden plan.

Oh glorious mystery, 
Sacrifice of Calvary,
And now I know 
Thou art  the great ""I Am."""
1001;Bound For The Promised Land;F;"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye,
Toward Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
Oh who will come and go with me?
I am bound for the promised land.

O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns,
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds, nor pois'nous breath,
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
Are feared and felt no more.

When shall I reach that happy place, 
And be forever blest!
When shall I see my Father's face,
And in His bosom rest?"
1002;How Great Thou Art;Bb;"Oh Lord my God!  
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds 
Thy hands have made;

I see the stars, 
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy pow'r throughout 
The universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!

Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;

When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;

That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me Home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!

Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great Thou art!"
1003;Leave It There;F;"If the world from you withholds 
Of its silver and its gold,
And you have to get along 
With meagre fare,
Just remember, in His Word, 
How He feeds the little bird;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

Leave it there, leave it there,
Take your burdens to the Lord 
And leave it there;

If you trust and never doubt,
He will surely bring you out;
Take your burdens to the Lord 
And leave it there.

If your body suffers pain 
And your health you can't regain,
And your soul is 
Almost sinking in despair,
Jesus knows the pain you feel,
He can save and He can heal;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your enemies assail
And your heart begins to fail,
Don't forget that God 
In heaven answers prayer;
He will make a way for you 
And will lead you safely through;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your youthful days are gone
And old age is stealing on,
And your body bends 
Beneath the weight of care;
He will never leave you then,
He'll go with you to the end;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there."
1004;What A Day That Will Be;F;"There is coming a day 
When no heartaches shall come,
No more clouds in the sky, 
No more tears to dim the eye;

All is peace forevermore 
On that happy golden shore,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

What a day that will be
When my Jesus I shall see,
When I look upon His face, 
The One who saved me by His grace;

When He takes me by the hand,
And leads me through 
The Promised Land,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

There'll be no sorrow there, 
No more burdens to bear,
No more sickness, no pain, 
No more parting over there;

And forever I will be 
With the One who died for me,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be."
1005;Nothing Between;F;"Nothing between my soul and the Saviour,
Naught of this world's delusive dream:
I have renounced all sinful pleasure,
Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.
---[Chorus:1]---
Nothing between my soul and the Saviour,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favour,
Keep the way clear!  Let nothing between.

Nothing between like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him ever sever;
He is my all, there's nothing between.

Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self or friends shall not intervene;
Though it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved, there's nothing between.

Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,
Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
I'll triumph at last, with nothing between."
1007;He Abides;F;"I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the pilgrim way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see,
And the reason for my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.

He abides, He abides,
Hallelujah, He abides with me
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died 
    upon the tree;

Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care
I'm as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me!

There's no thirsting for the things
Of the world, they've taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter abides with me!"
1008;That Man From Galilee;Eb;"In a manger long ago, 
I know it's really so,
A Babe was born 
To save men from their sin.
John saw Him on the shore, 
The Lamb forevermore,
Oh, the Christ, 
The Crucified of Calvary.
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh I love that Man from Galilee,
For He's done so very much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins, 
Placed the Holy Ghost within;
Oh I love that man 
     from Galilee.

The publican went to pray 
In the temple there one day,
He cried, ""O Lord 
     be merciful to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this Man 
     from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk, 
The dumb was made to talk,
That power was spoken with 
Love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man 
     from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of Man 
What must he do.
These words He said to him, 
""Ye must be born again,""
By the Spirit of that Man 
     from Galilee.

The woman at the well, 
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands 
She had at that time,
She was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that 
     Man from Galilee!"""
1010;Such Love;F;"That God should Love 
A sinner such as I,
Should yearn to change
My sorrow into bliss,
Nor rest till He had planned to bring me nigh,
How wonderful is Love like this!

Such Love, such wondrous Love,
Such Love, such wondrous Love,
That God should Love 
A sinner such as I,
How wonderful is Love like this!

That Christ should join 
So freely in the scheme,
Although it meant 
His death on Calvary,
Did ever human tongue find nobler theme
Than Love Divine that ransomed me?

That for a wilful 
Outcast such as I,
The Father planned, 
The Saviour bled and died;
Redemption for a worthless slave to buy,
Who long had law and Grace defied.

And now He takes me 
To His heart, a son,
He asks me not 
To fill a servant's place;
The ""far-off country"" wand'rings all are done,
Wide open are His arms of grace."
1012;The Day Of Redemption;F;"Nations are breaking, Israel's awaking,
The signs that the prophets 
     foretold;
The Gentile days numbered, 
With horrors encumbered;
Eternity soon will unfold.

The day of redemption is here,
Men's hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Your lamps trimmed and clear,
Look up! Your redemption is here.

The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem's restoring
Her national life, long dethroned;
Today she is calling, 
Her latter rain's falling,
""Return, Oh dispersed, to your own.""

Heaven's powers are shaking, 
And many are mistaking
God's meaning to be of the sky;
God's Church is the power
That's shaking this hour:
The day of redemption is nigh.

False prophets are lying, 
God's Truth they're denying,
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generation 
Spurns God's revelation,
We'll walk where the apostles have trod."
1013;Oh My Loving Brother;F;"Oh the judgment day is coming
What an awful day 'twill be,
Christ forever is my refuge
Rock of ages cleft for me.
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh, my loving brother,
When the world's on fire,
Don't you want God's bosom
To be your pillow,
Hide me over in the rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me.

Poor lost sinners will be crying,
For the home they'll never see,
But the ransomed will be singing
Rock of ages, cleft for me."
1014;Lights Of That City;F;"John tells of a city, 
That he saw coming down,
Where no sorrow or death will be known,
That someday we could go there
Through His marvelous grace,
Forever live in that heavenly home.
---[Chorus:1]---
I can almost see the lights of that city,
I see them gathering, all around
The great white throne;
With faith in my Saviour,
And His wonderful love,
Oh, I can almost see the lights of home.

And sometimes when I'm burdened,
And my cross seems hard to bear.
And old Satan, he tries to dim my view,
Well I just look unto Jesus,
He is standing close by,
Then once again, 
His great light shines through."
1015;I'm Looking For A City;F;"I'm looking for a city,
The one not made by hands,
I'm looking over Jordan,
I see the promised land,

The waters will be parted
And I'll be on my way,
As we're crossing over Jordan 
I can say:

Now I have that everlasting joy within,
Since He came and took away my sin,
The moment that He blessed me,
He made me fully whole,
With that everlasting joy 
Within my soul.

I'm drinking from the fountain
That floweth from on high,
A well of blessed waters
That never shall run dry,

I'm feasting on God's manna,
I'm praying day by day,
And that everlasting joy 
Is here to stay.

I've heard the prophet's message, 
I've placed it in my heart,
I've got the revelation 
That never shall depart,

The Rapture is upon us,
The stage is set to go.
Don't try to hold me back
You ought to know."
1016;All That Thrills My Soul;G;"Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
By His presence all divine?
True and Tender, pure and precious,
Oh how blest to call Him mine!

All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me;
And the fairest of ten thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.

Love of Christ so freely given,
Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heavens,
Deeper than the deepest sea.

What a wonderful redemption!
Never can a mortal know
How my sin, tho' red like crimson,
Can be whiter than the snow.

Every need His Hand supplying,
Every good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying,
He is all in all to me.

By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King."
1017;Come And Go With Me;F;"Come and go with me
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House.
Come and go with me,
To my Father's House,
Where There's peace, peace, peace.

Jesus will be there
In my Father's House
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House.
Jesus will be there
In my Father's House,
Where there's peace, peace, peace.

There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House, 
In my Father's House.
There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House.
There'll be joy, real joy."
1018;I'll Fly Away;G;"Some glad morning 
When this life is o'er
I'll fly away,
To a Home on God's 
     celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

I'll fly away, oh Glory, 
I'll fly away;
I won't die, 
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows 
Of this life have grown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird from prison 
     bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more 
Weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys 
     shall never end,
I'll fly away."
1019;It Is Love;F;"There is something in my soul 
Which keeps the shadows all away;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something lightens ev'ry burden,
Gives me gladness day by day,
It is love, my Saviour's love.
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh the precious Love of Jesus,
How it thrills my ransomed soul!
More and more I'll sing its praises
While the happy ages roll.

When the tempter tries to win me
Something keeps me true and strong;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something makes my life a blessing
To the needy in the throng,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

When misfortune overtakes me
Something calms my troubled breast;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something draws my soul to heaven,
That sweet land of peace and rest.
It is love, my Saviour's love.

Soul astray and bowed in sorrow,
Something waits for you today;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
It would give you peace and comfort,
Make your burdens roll away,
It is love, my Saviour's love."
1020;My Sins Are Gone;Eb;"You ask me why I'm happy
So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;
And when I meet the scoffers
Who ask me where they are,
I say, my sins are gone.

They're underneath the Blood,
Of the Cross of Calvary,
As far removed as darkness 
     is from dawn;

In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
That's good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me 
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

I'm living now for Jesus,
I'm happy night and day,
Because my sins are gone;
My soul is filled with music,
With all my heart I say,
I know my sins are gone."
1021;He Set Me Free;G;"Once like a bird 
In prison I dwelt.
No freedom from 
My sorrow I felt.

Then Jesus came 
And listened to me,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

He set me free, 
Yes, He set me free.
He broke the bonds 
Of prison for me.

I'm glory bound 
My Jesus to see,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

Now I am climbing 
Higher each day,
Darkness of night 
Has drifted away.

My feet are planted 
On higher ground,
Glory to God, 
I'm homeward bound.

Good-bye to sin 
And things that confound,
Naught of this world 
Shall turn me around,

Daily I'm working, 
I'm praying too,
Glory to God, 
I'm going through."
1022;The Great Emancipator;G;"Once my heart and life were fettered
By the binding chains of sin.
But the Great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

Glory, Glory, Hallelujah,
Blessed be His Holy Name!
He's the Great Emancipator,
That's the song of the Redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting
Oh, so helpless and alone, 
But the seeking Shepherd found me,
Led me to my Father's home."
1023;The Original Life;Bb;"God's attributes were manifested
To His Bride in this last age.
We have caught the revelation
By the last prophet's Message.

And we know who we are
And what we are raised up for, 
Praise the Lord, for the Original Life.

The Original Life, the Original Seed
The Original Word is what I believe.
The Son of Man is revealed
The Seventh Seal is unveiled
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say.
And our names are seen within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin.
Yes, we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who's the Original Life.

Our eyes of understanding
He has opened up at last.
And sweet victory is ours
Who were chained down in the past.

True Jubilee has sounded
And we have responded
To our God, Who's the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power.
Sleeping saints will wake and join us
For translation in this hour.

Gentiles' days will soon be over
Glory, hallelujah!
To our God, Who's the Original Life."
1024;All In All;G;"Of Jesus Love I'm singing
I praise Him every day;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He frees my soul from bondage,
He takes my guilt away;
Jesus is my All in All.
---[Chorus:1]---
All in All, All in All,
A strength in time of weariness
A light when shadows fall.
All in All, All in All,
Jesus is my All in All.

He's patient and so tender,
So loving and so kind;
He is my All in All, All in All.
Another Friend so faithful
My soul will never find;
Jesus is my All in All.

In time of need no other
To me can prove so dear;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He hears me though I whisper,
To help me He is near;
Jesus is my All in All."
1025;Till We Meet;Bb;"God be with you till we meet again!
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you 'til we meet again!
---[Chorus:1]---
Till we meet! Till we meet!
Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
Till we meet! Till we meet!
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!
'Neath His wings securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!
When life's perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you;
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!
Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
Smite death's threat'ning wave 
     before you;
God be with you till we meet again!"
1026;More About Jesus;F;"More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.
---[Chorus:1]---
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His Holy Will discern;
Spirit of God my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus in His Word, 
Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace."
1028;The Church's One Foundation;C;"The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord:
She is His new creation
By water and the Word.
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride;
With His own Blood He bought her
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth,
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping
Their cry goes up, ""How long?""
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song.

Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore.
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the church at rest."
1029;His Banner Over Me Is Love;F;"(He  brought me to

1031;We Are Heirs  (Verses);G;"We are heirs of the Father
We are joint-heirs with the Son.
We are people of His Kingdom
We are family, we are one.

We are washed,
We are sanctified.
We are cleansed by His Blood.
We are born of the Spirit
We are children of the Lord.

We are members of His Body.
We are objects of His Love.
We're partakers of His holiness
We are citizens of heaven above.

We're partakers of His suffering;
We're partakers of His grace.
We shall meet Him to be like Him
We shall see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming
We are looking to the skies;
We are watching, we are waiting,
We shall dwell with Him, we shall rise.

We shall reign with Him forever;
Men and angels shout and sing.
For dominion has been given
To the family of the King."
1034;This World Is Not My Home;F;"This world is not my home
I'm just a'passing through
My treasures are laid up 
Somewhere beyond the blue.

The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?

The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

They're all expecting me
And that's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus
Many years ago.

I know He'll see me through
Tho' I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?

The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Just over in the gloryland,
We'll live eternally;
The saints on every hand
Are shouting ""victory"".

The songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?

The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore."
1035;Lead Me To Calvary;Eb;"King of my life I crown Thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned 
     brow,
Lead me to Calvary.
---[Chorus:1]---
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony,
Lest I forget Thy Love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear,
Daily my cross for Thee:
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Fill me, Oh Lord, with Thy desire,
For all who know not Thee:
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
To speak of Calvary."
1036;I Don't Know What I'd Do;F;"I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord;
When I look around and see,
All that He has done for me,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord.

1037;Whisper A Prayer;F;"Whisper a prayer in the morning,
Whisper a prayer at noon,
Whisper a prayer in the evening,
To keep your heart in tune.

God answers prayer in the morning,

God answers prayer in the evening,
So keep your heart in tune.

Jesus may come in the morning,
Jesus may come at noon,
Jesus may come in the evening,
So keep your heart in tune."
1038;It Is Well With My Soul;C;"When peace like a river Attendeth my way,
When sorrows, Like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
""It is well, it is well with my soul.""

It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well 
With my soul.

Though Satan should buffet,
Though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control.

That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own Blood
     for my soul.

My sin - oh, the bliss 
Of this glorious thought -
My sin - not in part, 
But the whole

Is nailed to the cross;
And I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Oh my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee,
For Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, 
     is our goal;

Oh, the shout of the angel!
Oh, the voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope!
Blessed rest of my soul!"
1039;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God;C;"A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe -
His craft and pow'r are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He -
Lord Sabaoth His name,
From age to age the same -
And He must win the battle.

And tho this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph thru us.
The Prince of darkness grim - 
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! His doom is sure -
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow'rs -
No thanks to them - abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Thru Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still -
His kingdom is forever."

1041;Arise, My Soul, Arise;Ab;"Arise, my soul, arise;
Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding sacrifice
    in my behalf appears:
Before the throne my surety stands,
Before the throne my surety stands,
My name is written on His hands.

He ever lives above, 
For me to intercede;
His all redeeming love, 
His precious Blood, to plead:
His Blood atoned for all our race,
His Blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

Five bleeding wounds He bears;
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers; 
They strongly plead for me:
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Nor let that ransomed sinner die!""

The Father hears Him pray,
His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away, 
The presence of His Son;
His Spirit answers to the Blood,
His Spirit answers to the Blood,
And tells me I am born of God.

My God is reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear:
With confidence I now draw nigh,
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And ""Father, Abba, Father,"" cry."
1042;Thank God I Am Free;G;"For a long time I travelled
Down a long lonely road;
My heart was so heavy in sin I sank low.
Then I heard about Jesus,
What a wonderful hour;

I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out
Through His saving power.

Thank God I am free, free, free
From this world of sin.
Washed in the Blood of Jesus,
I've been born again.

Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved
By His wonderful Grace.
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out 
And show me the way.

Like a bird out of prison
That has taken its flight;
Like a blind man that God 
Gave back  his sight.

Like a poor wretched beggar
That's found fortune and fame,
I'm so glad that I found out 
He could bring me out
Through His Holy Name."
1043;Land Of Milk And Honey;G;"There is a land of milk and honey
There is a land
Where we won't need money.
There is a land 
Shining with jasper.
There we shall see 
Our blessed Saviour.
---[Chorus:1]---
And that's the reason
We shout ""Hallelujah""
Praising our King across the river.
That shining river
Where the saints will gather
There we shall see 
Our blessed Messiah.

Elijah has come, 
He has done his work already
As John has said, 
The Bride has made ready.
And now we are waiting 
For the coming of Jesus.
For that blessed day
When the Lamb shall take us.

Our hopes are bright, 
Our lamps are burning.
And day by day 
Our hearts are yearning.
This is the evening
He will come in the morning.
Then we shall wait 
Until the dawning."
1044;He Paid A Debt;C;"He paid a debt He did not owe,
I owed a debt I could not pay,
I needed someone to wash 
     my sins away;

And now I sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay.

He paid a debt at Calvary,
He cleansed my soul and 
     set me free,
I'm glad that Jesus did all 
     my sins erase.
I now can sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay.

One day He's coming back for me,
To live with Him eternally,
Won't it be glory to see Him 
     on that day!
I then will sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay."
1045;But until Then;Bb;"My heart can sing 
When I pause to remember,
A heartache here  
Is but a stepping stone,

Along the trail 
That's winding always upward,
This troubled world 
Is not my final home.

But until then, 
My heart will go on singing,
Until then, 
With joy I'll carry on.

Until the day 
Mine eyes behold that City
Until the day 
God calls me home.

The things of earth 
Will dim and lose their value,
If we recall, 
They're borrowed for a while

And things of earth 
That cause the heart to tremble
Remembered there, 
Will only bring a smile.

This weary world 
With all its toil and struggle,
May take its toll 
Of misery and strife,
The soul of man 
Is like a waiting eagle
When it's released 
It's destined for the sky."
1046;This Is Like Heaven To Me;F;"We find many people 
Who can't understand
Why we are so happy and free,

To Canaan's fair land,
And this is like heaven to me.
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh this is like heaven to me,
Yes, this is like heaven to me.
I've crossed over Jordan 
To Canaan's fair land,
And this is like heaven to me.

So when we are happy 
We sing and we shout,
Some don't understand us, you see;
We're filled with the Spirit, 
There is not a doubt,
And this is like heaven to me.

We've heard the sweet music, 
The heavenly chord
From glory land over the sea;
A soul-thrilling message 
From Jesus our Lord,
And this is like heaven to me."
1047;I've Been Changed;Ab;"I've been to the water,
And I've been baptized,
I've been washed 
In the Blood of the Lamb;
I've been changed 
From the creature
That I once was,
And redeemed is now my name.
---[Chorus:1]---
I've been changed, 
I've been reborn,
All my life has been rearranged;
What a difference it makes
When the Lord has His way
All my life praise God, 
Has been changed.

Tho' my sins were as scarlet
They're white as snow,
I was bound but today I am free;
I was lost in the darkness
But now I'm found,
I was blind but now I see.

When at last in His presence
I stand above,
He will wipe every tear 
From my eyes;
And I'll thank Him for giving 
A wretch like me,
A new home beyond the sky."
1048;I'm In That Number;Ab;"I'm in that number, I'm in that number,
I'm in that number robed in white;
I'm in that number, I'm in that number,
I'm in that number robed in white.

I'm in that  number,
That Blood-washed number,
I'm in that number robed in white;
I'm in that number
That Blood-washed number,
I'm in that number robed in white.

John saw that number,
The Blood-washed number,
John saw that number robed in white;
John saw that number,
That Blood-washed number,
John saw that number robed in white."
1049;Let Go Of The Old;Eb;"Let, let go of the old,
And lay, lay hold on the new,
In laying it down a new life is found
There a new life waits for you.

Cast your bread upon the waters
After many days it shall return.
If you pour out your soul
Not a part, but the whole
A new life is there for you.

In saving your life, you will lose it,
But by losing it, you will find it,
Down in the ground 
That's where death is found,
Death that brings life anew."

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story 
Of the Christ who died for me
Sing it with the saints in glory, 
Gathered by the crystal sea.

I was lost, but Jesus found me,  
Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me, 
Drew me back into the way.

I was bruised but Jesus healed me,  
Faint was I from many a fall,
Sight was gone, 
And fears possessed me, 
But He freed me from them all.

Soon He'll come the Lord of Glory,  
Come the church His bride to claim,
And complete the wondrous story, 
Come, Lord Jesus, come again.

He will keep me till the river  
Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He'll bear me safely over, 
Where the loved ones I shall meet."
1068;He Hideth My Soul;C;"A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Saviour to me,
He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

He hideth my soul In the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life
In the depths of His Love,
And covers me there with His Hand,
And covers me there with His Hand.

A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away,
He holdeth me up, 
And I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

With numberless blessings
Each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,
For such a Redeemer as mine!

When clothed in His brightness,
Transported I rise,
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, 
His wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high."
1069;There Shall Be Showers of Blessing;Ab;"There shall be showers of blessing;  
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,  
Sent from the Saviour above.
---[Chorus:1]---
Showers of blessing, 
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,  
But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing  
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,  
Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of blessing.  
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,  
Come, and now honor Thy Word.

There shall be showers of blessing.  
Oh that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing, 
Now as on Jesus we call!"
1070;Saved, Saved!;F;"I've found a friend who is all to me, 
His Love is ever true;
I love to tell how He lifted me.  
And what His grace can do for you.
---[Chorus:1]---
Saved by His pow'r divine,  
Saved to new life sublime!
Life now is sweet 
And my joy is complete, 
For I'm saved, saved, saved!

He saves me from 
Ev'ry sin and harm,  
Secures my soul each day;
I'm leaning strong on His mighty arm;  
I know He'll guide me all the way.

When poor and needy 
     and all alone,  
In love He said to me, 
""Come unto me and I'll 
     lead you home,  
To live with me eternally."""
1071;There Is Power In The Blood;Bb;"Would you be free 
From the burden of sin?
There's power in the Blood, 
Power in the Blood;

Would you o'er evil 
    a victory win?
There's wonderful pow'r 
     in the Blood.

There is power, power, 
    wonder-working power
In the Blood of the Lamb;

There is power, power 
     wonder-working power
In the precious Blood of the Lamb.

Would you be free 
From your passion and pride?
There's power in the Blood, 
    power in the Blood;

Come for a cleansing 
    to Calvary's tide;
There's wonderful power 
     in the Blood.

Would you be whiter, 
    much whiter than snow?
There's power in the Blood, 
    power in the Blood;

Sin-stains are lost 
    in its life-giving flow;
There's wonderful power 
     in the Blood.

Would you do service 
    for Jesus your King?
There's power in the Blood, 
    power in the Blood;

Would you live daily 
    His praises to sing?
There's wonderful power 
     in the Blood.

Daar is krag, krag,
Wonderbare krag,
In die dierbare Bloed
  van die Lam.
Daar is krag, krag,
Wonderbare krag,
In die dierbare Bloed 
   van die Lam."
1072;One Of Them;Bb;"There are people almost everywhere,
Whose hearts are all aflame,
With the fire that fell at Pentecost,
Which cleansed and made them clean;

It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His name!
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

(One of them, hallelujah, 
One of them;
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!) X2

Though these people may not 
      learned be,
Nor boast of worldly fame,
They have all received their Pentecost,
Baptized in Jesus' name;

And are telling now, both far and wide,
His power is yet the same,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

They were gathered in the upper room,
All praying in His name,
They were baptized with the 
     Holy Ghost,
And power for service came;

Now what He did for them that day
He'll do for you the same;
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

Come, my brother, seek this blessing
That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy-bells ringing
And will keep your soul aflame;

It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His Name,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!"
1073;Living Where the Healing Waters Flow;F;"I've cast my heavy burdens down 
      on Canaan's happy shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
I'll wander in the wilderness of
      doubt and sin no more;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.
---[Chorus:1]--- 
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, 
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

With Israel's trusting children
     I'm rejoicing on my way, 
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
The cloudy, fiery pillar
     is my guiding light today.
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

My hung'ring soul is satisfied 
     with manna from above,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
No more I thirst, the rock I've found,
      that fount of endless love;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

I'm singing ""Hallelujah,""
      safely anchored in my soul,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
I'm resting onHispromises; 
      the Blood has made me whole.
I'm living where the healing waters flow."
1074;Hidden Peace;C;"I cannot tell thee whence it came. 
This peace within my breast;
But this I know, there fills my soul
A strange and tranquil rest.
---[Chorus:1]---
There's a deep, settled peace in my soul,
There's a deep settled peace in my soul;
Tho' the billows of sin near me roll, 
He abides, Christ abides.

Beneath the toil and care of life,
This hidden stream flows on;
My weary soul no longer thirsts,
Nor am I sad and lone.

I cannot tell the half of Love,
Unfeigned, supreme, divine,
That caused my darkest in-most self
With beams of hope to shine.

I cannot tell thee why He chose
To suffer and to die,
But if I suffer here with Him
I'll reign with Him on high."
1075;I Would Not Be Denied;C;"When pangs of death 
Seized on my soul,
Unto the Lord I cried,
Till Jesus came and 
     made me whole,
I would not be denied.
---[Chorus:1]---
I would not be denied,
I would not be denied,
Till Jesus came and 
     made me whole,
I would not be denied.

As Jacob in the days of old,
I wrestled with the Lord;
And instant, with 
     a courage bold,
I stood upon His word.

Old Satan said my Lord 
     was gone
And would not hear my prayer,
But, praise the Lord! 
The work is done
And Christ the Lord is here."
1077;Deeper, Deeper;G;"Deeper, deeper,
In the Love of Jesus
Daily let me go;
Higher, higher,
In the school of wisdom,
More of grace to know.

Deeper yet, I pray,
And higher every day,
And wiser, blessed Lord,
In Thy precious, holy Word.

Deeper, deeper!  
Blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is 
Wholly lost in Jesus,
And His perfect will.

Deeper, deeper! 
Though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the 
Holy Love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

Deeper, higher, 
Every day in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqueror, 
And in His own image
Perfected at last."
1078;Beulah Land;F;"I've reached the land of corn and wine, 
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.

Oh Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.
As on Thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory-shore,
My heav'n, my home forevermore!

My Saviour comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by the hand, 
For this is heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from eververnal trees,
And flow'rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody.
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song."
1079;The Haven Of Rest;F;"My soul in sad exile 
Was out on life's sea,
So burdened with sin 
     and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice 
Saying, ""Make me your choice;""
And I entered the Haven of Rest.

I've anchored my soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
I'll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep 
O'er the wild, stormy deep;
But in Jesus I am safe evermore

I yielded myself 
ToHistender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, 
And I anchored my soul;
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, 
Since the Lord made me whole,    
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus who'll save 
Whosoever will have
A home in the Haven of Rest.

How precious the thought 
That we all may recline,
Like John the beloved and blest,
On Jesus' strong arm 
Where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the Haven of Rest.

Oh come to the Saviour, 
He patiently waits,
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
And say, ""My Beloved is mine."""
1080;There Is A Fountain Filled With Blood;Bb;"There is a fountain filled with Blood
Drawn from Immanuel's Veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
(Lose all their guilty stains) X 3
And sinners plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in His Day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
(Wash all my sins away) X 3
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious Blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God
(Be saved, to sin no more) X 3
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

For since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming Love has been my theme,
(And shall be till I die) X 3
Redeeming Love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
(Lies silent in the grave) X 3
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave."
1081;Standing On The Promises;Bb;"Standing on the promises 
Of Christ my King,
Through eternal ages
Let His praises ring;

Glory in the highest 
I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing, standing, 
Standing on the promises 
Of God, my Saviour;
Standing, standing, 
I'm standing on 
The promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
That cannot fail,
When the howling storms 
Of doubt and fear assail,

By the living Word of God 
I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I now can see
Perfect, present cleansing 
In the Blood for me;

Standing in the liberty 
Where Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
Of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally 
By love's strong cord,

Overcoming daily 
With the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises 
I cannot fall,
Listening every moment 
To the Spirit's call,

Resting in my Saviour 
As my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God."
1082;Alone With God;F;"When storms of life are round 
     me beating.
When rough the path that I have trod,
Within my closet door retreating,
I love to be alone with God.
---[Chorus:1]---
Alone with God, the world forbidden.
Alone with God, Oh blest retreat!
Alone with God and in Him hidden,
To hold with Him communion sweet.

What tho' the clouds have 
    gathered o'er me?
What tho' I've passed beneath the rod?
God's perfect will there lies before me,
When I am thus alone with God.

'Tis there I find new strength for duty,
As o'er the sands of time I plod;
I see the King in all His beauty.
While resting there alone with God.

And when I see the moment nearing
When I shall sleep beneath the sod,
When time with me is disappearing,
I want to be alone with God."
1083;Marching On;C;"Marching on in the light of God,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Up the path that the Master trod, 
Marching, marching on.

A robe of white, a crown of gold,
A harp, a home, a mansion fair,
A victor's palm, a joy untold,
Are mine when I get there.

Marching on thro' the hosts of sin, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Vict'ry's mine, while I've Christ within,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on while the skeptics sneer, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Perfect Love casteth out all fear,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on with the flag unfurled,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Preaching Christ to the dying world,
Marching, marching on."
1084;Praise The Lord;Ab;"To God be the glory, 
Great things He hath done,
So loved He the world that 
He gave us His Son,

Who yielded His life 
An atonement for sin,
And opened the Life-Gate 
That all may go in.

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice;

Oh, come to the Father, 
Through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; 
Great things He hath done.

Oh, perfect redemption, 
The purchase of Blood,
To every believer 
The promise of God;

The vilest offender 
Who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus 
A pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing 
Through Jesus the Son;

But purer, and higher, 
And greater will be
Our wonder, our transport 
When Jesus we see."
1085;Oh To Be Like Thee;C;"Oh to be like Thee, 
Blessed Redeemer,
This is my constant longing and prayer;
Gladly I'll forfeit,
All of earth's treasures,
Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.

Oh to be like Thee, Oh to be like Thee,
Blessed Redeemer, Pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, 
Come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image 
Deep on my heart.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Full of compassion, loving, forgiving, 
Tender and kind,
Helping the helpless, 
Cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wandering sinner to find.

Oh to be like Thee,  
Lowly in spirit, 
Holy and harmless, 
Patient and brave;
Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer, 
Others to save.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lord, I am coming,
Now to receive the Anointing divine,
All that I am and have 
I am bringing,
Lord, from this moment 
All shall be Thine.

Oh to be like Thee, 
While I am pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit, 
Fill with Thy love,
Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,
Fit me for life and heaven above."
1086;Count Your Blessings;Eb;"When upon life's billows 
You are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged, 
Thinking all is lost,

Count your many blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you 
What the Lord has done.

Are you ever burdened 
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?

Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing 
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised 
You His wealth untold;

Count your many blessings, 
Money cannot buy
Your reward in Heaven, 
Nor your Home on high.

So, amid the conflict, 
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, 
God is over all;

Count your many blessings, 
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you 
To your journey's end.

Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Count your blessings,
See what God has done;

Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
And it will surprise you
What the Lord has done."
1087;What A Friend;F;"What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there."
1088;I Will Praise Him;Eb;"When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing,
When He said, Wilt thou be clean?

I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His Blood has washed away 
     each stain.

Though the way seems straight 
     and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him,
Glory, glory to His name!

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in;
He's forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin."
1089;Ho! Everyone that Is Thirsty;F;"Ho! ev'ry one that is thirsty in spirit,
Ho! ev'ry one that is weary and sad,
Come to the fountain, 
There's fullness in Jesus,
All that you're longing for, 
Come and be glad.
---[Chorus:1]---
""I will pour water on him 
    who is thirsty, 
I will pour floods upon 
     the dry ground;
Open your heart 
For the gift I am bringing,
While ye are seeking Me, 
I will be found.""

Child of the world, 
Are you tired of your bondage?
Weary of earth-joys,
So false, so untrue;
Thirsting for God, 
AndHisfullness of blessing?
List to the promise -- 
A message for you.

Child of the kingdom, 
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Nothing but fullness 
Thy longing can meet.
'Tis the enduement 
For life and for service;
Thine is the promise, 
So certain, so sweet."
1090;Feasting With My Lord;F;"Since my soul is saved 
     and sanctified,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
In this land of Canaan I'll abide,
Feasting with my Lord.
---[Chorus:1]---
Feasting, I am feasting,
Feasting with my Lord;
Feasting, I am feasting
On the living Word.

Feeding on the honey 
     and the wine,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Gathering the clusters 
     from the vine,
Feasting with my Lord.

Day by day we have 
     a new supply,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
And the food is never 
     stale nor dry,
Feasting with my Lord.

Many times we have 
     an extra spread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Then to deeper truths 
     I have been led,
Feasting with my Lord.

Often there are only 
     just us two,
Feasting I'm feasting
Then He tells me what 
     He'd have me do,
Feasting with my Lord.

If perchance the cupboard's
     scarce of bread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
On the hidden manna 
      I am fed,
Feasting with my Lord."
1091;Oh Say, But I'm Glad;C;"There is a song in my heart today,
Something I never had;
Jesus has taken my sins away,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

Oh say, but I'm glad, I'm glad,
Oh say, but I'm glad;
Jesus has come 
And my cup's overrun;
Oh say but I'm glad.

Wonderful, marvelous 
Love He brings,
Into a heart that's sad;
Through darkest tunnels 
The soul just sings,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

We have a fellowship 
Rich and sweet,
Tongues can never relate;
Abiding in Him is a real treat,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

Won't you come to Him 
With all your care,
Weary and worn and sad?
You too, will sing 
As His Love you share.
Oh say, but I'm glad."
1092;The Comforter Has Come;Bb;"Oh spread the tidings 'round,
Wherever man is found,
Wherever human hearts
And human woes abound;
Let every Christian tongue
Proclaim the joyful sound:
The Comforter has come!
---[Chorus:1]---
The Comforter has come, 
The Comforter has come!
The Holy Ghost from Heav'n, 
The Father's promise giv'n;
O spread the tidings 'round, 
Wherever man is found --
The Comforter has come!

Lo, the great King of kings,
With healing in His wings,
To every captive soul 
A full deliv'rance brings;
And through the vacant cells
The song of triumph rings;
The Comforter has come!

Oh boundless Love divine! 
How shall this tongue of mine 
To wond'ring mortals tell
The matchless grace divine
That I, a child of hell,
Should in His image shine!
The Comforter has come!"
1093;Trust And Obey;F;"When we walk with the Lord
In the Light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.
---[Chorus:1]---
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favour He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey."
1094;The Breaking of the Day;Eb;"Tis almost time for the Lord to come, 
I hear the people say;
The stars of heav'n are growing dim:
It must be the breaking of the day.
---[Chorus:1]---
O, it must be the breaking of the day,
O, it must be the breaking of the day;
The night is almost gone,
The day is coming on:
O, it must be the breaking of the day.

The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
In earth and sea and sky,
Aloud proclaim to mortal men,
That the coming of the Master
     draweth nigh.

It must be time for the waiting church 
To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps
To look for the breaking of the day.

There must be those in the field of sin,
Far from the fold astray,
Who once were happy in Jesus' love,
And looking for the breaking of the day.

Go quickly out in the streets and lanes,
And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt and blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the day."
1095;Faith Of Our Fathers! Living Still;G;"Faith of our fathers! living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
Oh how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word
---[Chorus:1]---
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children's fate,
If they, like them, could die for Thee!

Faith of our fathers! we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, 
As Love knows how,
By kindly words and virtuous life!"
1096;Under His Wings;C;"Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Though the night deepens 
     and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him, 
I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, 
And I am His child.
---[Chorus:1]---
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His Love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

Under His wings, 
What a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly 
Turns to His rest!
Often when earth has 
No balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, 
And there I am blest.

Under His wings, 
O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till 
Life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, 
No evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus 
I'm safe evermore."
1097;Lead Me, Savior;C;"Saviour lead me, lest I stray,
Gently lead me all the way;
I am safe when by Thy side, 
I would in Thy Love abide.

Lead me, lead me, Saviour, 
lead me, lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me Saviour, all the way.

Thou the refuge of my soul,
When life's stormy billows roll,
I am safe when Thou art nigh,
All my hopes on Thee rely.

Saviour, lead me, then at last, 
When the storm of life is past,
To the land of endless day, 
Where all tears are wiped away."
1098;I See A Crimson Stream;Ab;"On cal'vry's hill of sorrow
Where sin's demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid
---[Chorus:1]---
I see a crimson stream of Blood.
It flows from Calvary,
Its waves which reach the throne of God,
Are sweeping over me.

Today no condemnation
Abides to turn away
My soul from his salvation,
He's in my heart to stay

When gloom and sadness whisper,
""You'e sinned - No use to pray"",
I look away to Jesus,
And He tells me to say:

And when we reach the portal 
Where life forever reigns,
The ransdomed hosts' grand final 
Will be this glad refrain"
1099;Like Zion's Holy Mount;C;"All they who put their trust in God
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount,
By many ages proved.
---[Chorus:1]---
Like the mount of God, 
Like the mount of God;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
By many ages proved.
They can never be removed, removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
They can never be removed.

As round about Jerusalem
The rugged mountains lie,
So round about His holy saints
Our God is ever nigh.

Tho' fierce the storm in fury beat
And awful thunders roar,
The children of the mighty God
Are safe forevermore.

Thus over-shadowed by His love,
Where harm can ne'er betide,
Within this refuge safe and sure
I ever would abide"
1100;My Faith Looks Up To Thee;Eb;"My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Saviour divine!

Now hear me while I pray,
Take all my sin away,
O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;

As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;

Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When ends life's transient dream,
When death's cold, sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll;

Blest Saviour, then, in love,
Fear and distrust remove;
O bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul!"
1102;Joy Unspeakable;G;"I have found His grace 
Is all complete,
He supplieth every need;
While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet,
I am free, yes free indeed.

It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
And the half has never yet been told.

I have found the pleasure 
I once craved,
It is joy and peace within;
What a wondrous blessing! 
I am saved
From the awful guilt of sin.

I have found that hope 
So bright and clear,
Living in the realm of grace;
Oh, the Saviour's presence is so near,
I can see His smiling face.

I have found the joy 
No tongue can tell,
How its waves of glory roll!
It is like a great o'erflowing well,
Springing up within my soul."
1103;Higher Ground;F;"I'm pressing on the upward way
New heights I'm gaining every day
Still praying as I'm onward bound
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground

Lord, lift me up and let me stand
By faith on Heaven's table land
A higher plane than I have found
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay
Though some may dwell 
Where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground

I want to live above the world
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled
For faith has caught the joyful sound
The song of saints on higher ground

I want to scale the utmost height
And catch a gleam of Glory bright
But still I'll pray till Heaven I've found
Lord, lead me on to higher ground"
1104;In the Twinkling of an Eye;Bb;"When the trump of the great archangel
Its mighty tones shall sound,
And, the end of the world proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of man shall come in His glory,
With all the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies 
     from the multitudes that rise,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.
---[Chorus:1]---
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
The trumpet shall sound, the dead 
     shall be raised,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

When He comes in the clouds descending,
And they who loved Him here,
From their graves shall awake and praise Him
With joy and not with fear;
When the body and the soul are united,
And clothed no more to die,
What a shouting there will be 
     when each other's face we see,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Oh the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in pow'r
And the songs of the Blood-bought millions 
Shall hail that blissful hour;
When we gather safely home in the morning,
And night's dark shadows fly,
What a shouting on the shore
     when we meet to part no more,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye."
1105;Rock of Ages;Bb;"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the Water and the Blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee."
1106;Signs Are Everywhere;Bb;"The King is coming in glory 
To catch His bride away,
It may be in the morning  
It may be at mid-day, 
At the even or midnight; 
The trump will sound so clear,
The dead in Christ, and we that live,
His voice shall hear.
---[Chorus:1]---
The King is coming, hallelujah! 
He's coming in the air,
The fig tree is budding, 
The signs are everywhere,
The saints are looking ever up-ward
While jour'ning on their way, 
He's coming, hallelujah!
To catchHisbride away.

Behold! He cometh, and leaping  
And skipping o'er the hills;
Like the young roe, like the young hart, 
My soul with rapture thrills; 
Thru the window He's looking,
Thru the lattice-work is seen, 
The winter's past, the rain is o'er, 
The figs are green.

The King is coming , ""Be ready,""  
To meet Him on that day;
With your heart right, 
     with your robes white,
And in this holy way;  
Like the light'ning that flashes
In the twinkling of an eye, 
Our Lord shall come to claim His own
He's drawing nigh."
1107;Close To Thee;F;"Thou, my everlasting portion
More than friend or life to me
All along my pilgrim journey
Saviour let me walk with Thee
Close to Thee, close to Thee
Close to Thee close to Thee
All along my pilgrim journey
Saviour let me walk with Thee

Not for ease or worldly pleasure
Nor for fame my prayer shall be
Gladly will I toil and suffer
Only let me walk with Thee
Close to Thee, close to Thee
Close to Thee, close to Thee
Gladly will I toil and suffer
Only let me walk with Thee

Lead me through the vale of shadows
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea
Then the gates of life eternal
May I enter, Lord with Thee
Close to Thee, close to Thee
Close to Thee, close to Thee
Then the gates of life eternal
May I enter, Lord with Thee"
1108;Search Me oh God;F;"Search me, Oh God, 
And know my heart today;
Try me, Oh Saviour, 
Know my thoughts, I pray:

See if there be some wicked 
     way in me:
Cleanse me from every sin, 
     and set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing 
     me from sin:
Fulfil Thy Word, and make me 
     pure within:

Fill me with fire where once 
I burned with shame:
Grant my desire to magnify 
     Thy name.

Lord take my life, and make it 
     wholly Thine:
Fill my poor heart with 
Thy great Love divine;

Take all my will, my passion, 
     self and pride;
I now surrender: Lord in me abide.

Oh, Holy Ghost, revival comes 
     from Thee:
Send a revival, 
Start the work in me:

Thy Word declares, 
Thou wilt supply our need:
For blessing now, Oh Lord, 
     I humbly plead."
1109;He Rolled the Sea Away;C;"When Israel out of bondage came,
A sea before them lay;
The Lord reach'd down 
    His mighty hand,
And rolled the sea away.
---[Chorus:1]---
Then forward still, 
    'tis Jehovah's will, 
Tho' the billows dash and spray,
With a conq'ring tread 
    we will push ahead
He'll roll the sea away.

Before me was a sea of sin,
So great I feared to pray;
My heart's desire the Savior read,
And rolled the sea away.

When sorrows dark, like stormy waves,
Were dashing o'er my way,
Again the Lord in mercy came, 
And rolled the sea away.

And when I reach the sea of death,
For needed grace I'll pray;
I know the Lord will quickly come,
And roll the sea away."
1110;Oh That Will Be Glory;F;"When all my labours and trials are o'er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
Will through the ages be glory for me.
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh that will be glory for me,
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace 
I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.

When by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in Heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Friends will be there 
I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me."
1111;We'll Understand It Better By And By;F;"We are often tossed and driven
On the restless sea of time,
Somber skies and howling tempests
Oft succeed a bright sunshine,
In that land of perfect day,
When the mists have rolled away,
We will understand it better by and by.

By and by when the 
   morning comes,
When the saints of God 
   are gathered home,
We will tell the story how 
    we've overcome;
For we'll understand it better 
      by and by.

We are often destitute
Of the things that life demands,
Want of food, want of shelter,
Thirsty hills and barren lands,
We are trusting in the Lord,
And according to His Word,
We will understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares
Often take us unawares,
And our hearts are made to bleed
For many thoughtless word or deed,
And we wonder why the test
When we try to do our best,
But we'll understand it better by and by."
1112;Redeemed;G;"Redeemed how I love to proclaim it,
Redeemed by the Blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child and forever, I am.

Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the Blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the Light of His Presence
In me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His Love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night."
1113;God Leads Us Along;C;"In shady green pastures, 
     so rich and sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water's cool flow 
Bathes the weary one's feet,
God leads His dear children along.
---[Chorus:1]---
Some thro' the waters, 
Some thro' the flood,
Some thro' the fire, 
But all thro' the Blood;
Some thro' great sorrow, 
But God gives a song;
In the night season 
And all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount 
Where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley 
In the darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

Tho' sorrows befall us, 
And Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, 
Defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.

Away from the mire, 
And away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity's day.
God leads His dear children along."
1114;He Brought Me Out;C;"My heart was distressed 
'Neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins 
Dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord 
From the deep, miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out 
     to golden day.

He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah.

He placed me upon 
The strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established 
     and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling 
While here I remain,
But stand by His grace 
Until the crown I gain.

He gave me a song, 
'Twas a new song of praise,
By day and by night 
Its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing, 
I'm happy and free,
I'll praise my Redeemer, 
Who has rescued me.

I'll sing of His wonderful 
     mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men 
His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation 
At home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth 
And trust in God."
1115;Like a Mighty Sea;F;"My soul today is thirsting 
     for living streams divine,
To sweep from highest heaven 
     to this poor heart of mine;
I stand upon the promise, 
     in Jesus' name I plead;
Oh send the gracious current
     to satisfy my need.
---[Chorus:1]---
Like a mighty sea,
      like a mighty sea,
Comes the Love of Jesus, 
     sweeping over me;
The waves of glory roll,
     the Savior to extol,
Comes the Love of Jesus,
     sweeping o'er my soul.

I see the clouds arising,
     the mercy clouds of love,
That come to bring refreshing
   down from the throne above,
The earnest of the shower,
     just now to us is giv'n,
And now we wait, expecting 
     the floods of grace from heav'n.

The show'rs of grace are falling,
     the tide is rolling in,
The flood-tide of salvation,
     with pow'r to cleanse from sin;
It's surging thro' my being 
     and takes my sin away,
It keeps me shouting glory!
     thro' all the happy day.

It's coming, yes, it's coming,
     it's coming down this hour,
A torrent of salvation  
     in saving cleansing pow'r.
I hear the billows surging,
     I see them mount and roll;
Oh glory, hallelujah!
     they're sweeping thro' my soul."
1116;Glory To His Name;G;"Down at the cross Where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing From sin I cried;
There to my heart Was the Blood applied;
Glory to His name!

Glory to His name!
Glory to His name!
There to my heart 
Was the Blood applied;
Glory to His name!

I am so wondrously Saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly Abides within,
There at the cross Where He took me in;
Glory to His name!

Oh, precious fountain That saves from sin!
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me And keeps me clean;
Glory to His name!

Come to this fountain So rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul At the Savior's feet;
Plunge in today And be made complete;
Glory to His name!"
1117;It Is Mine;Bb;"God's abiding peace 
Is in my soul today,
Yes, I feel it now,
Yes, I feel it now;
He has taken all my 
Doubts and fears away,
Though I cannot tell you how.
---[Chorus:1]---
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
He has given peace, 
Perfect peace to me;
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
Mine for all eternity!

He has wrought in me 
A sweet and perfect rest,
In my raptured heart 
I can feel it now;
He each passing moment 
Keeps me saved and blest,
Floods with light 
My heart and brow.

He has given me 
A never failing joy,
Oh, I have it now! 
Oh, I have it now!
To His praise I will my 
Ransomed pow'rs employ,
And renew my grateful vow.

Oh, the Love of God 
Is comforting my soul,
For His Love is mine, 
Yes, His Love is mine!
Waves of joy and gladness 
O'er my spirit roll,
Thrilling me with life divine."
1118;Builded on the Rock;F;"I builded on the Rock,
On the Rock of God,
Builded on the Rock,Christ Jesus;
I dug down deep 
And builded on the Rock,
Builded on the Rock of God.
---[Chorus:1]---
I hold not the Rock,
But the Rock holds me
The Rock holds me, 
The Rock holds me;
I rest on the Rock,
And the Rock holds me,
Resting on the Rock of God.

Why should I fear 
When the winds sweep by?
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Or shaken be when 
The waves roll high?
Builded on the Rock of God.

Hush, raging billows at His command, 
Builded of the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Oh, peace be still 'neath 
His loving hand!
Builded on the Rock of God.

Praise God for our foundation sure! 
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
No storms can harm our house secure,
Builded on the Rock of God."
1119;At Calvary;C;"Years I spent in vanity 
     and pride,
Caring not my Lord 
     was crucified,

Knowing not it was for 
     me He died
On Calvary.

Mercy there was great, 
     and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied 
     to me;
There my burdened soul 
     found liberty, at Calvary.

By God's Word at last my 
     sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law 
     I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring 
     turned, to Calvary.

Mercy there was great, 
     and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied 
     to me;
There my burdened soul 
     found liberty, at Calvary.

Now I've given to Jesus 
     everything,
Now I gladly own Him as 
     my King,
Now my raptured soul can 
     only sing, of Calvary.

Mercy there was great, 
     and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied 
     to me;

There my burdened soul 
     found liberty, at Calvary.

Oh, the Love that drew 
     salvation's plan!
Oh, the Grace that brought 
      it down to man!

Oh, the mighty gulf that 
     God did span, at Calvary!

Mercy there was great, 
     and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied 
     to me;

There my burdened soul 
     found liberty,
At Calvary."
1121;Jesus Paid It All;C;"I hear the Saviour say,
""Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.""

Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots,
And melt the heart of stone.

Since nothing good have I,
Whereby Thy grace to claim;
I'll wash my garments white
In the Blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
""Jesus died my soul to save,""
My lips shall still repeat."
1123;The Healing Waters;C;"Oh, the joy of sins forgiv'n,
Oh, the bliss the Blood-washed know,
Oh, the peace akin to heav'n,
Where the healing waters flow.
---[Chorus:1]---
Where the healing waters flow
Where the joys celestial glow,
Oh, there's peace and rest and love,
Where the healing waters flow!

Now with Jesus crucified,
AtHisfeet I'm resting low;
Let me evermore abide
Where the healing waters flow.

Oh, this precious perfect love!
How it keeps the heart aglow,
Streaming from the fount above,
Where the healing waters flow.

Oh, to lean on Jesus' breast,
While the tempests come and go!
Here is blessed peace and rest,
Where the healing waters flow.

Cleansed from ev'ry sin and stain,
Whiter than the driven snow,
Now I sing my sweet refrain,
Where the healing waters flow."
1124;My Sheep Know My Voice;G;"My sheep know my Voice
And the path that I take,
They follow wherever I go;
My sheep know my Voice
And come at My call,
But a stranger's voice do they not know.

My sheep know My Voice
And day by day
They abide in the fold
And go not astray;

They love Me because
I have made them My choice
And they follow My call
For My sheep know my Voice.

My sheep know My Voice
And the pastures of green
Where I lead them so often to feed;
My sheep know My Voice and the cool sparkling stream
Where beside its still waters I lead.

My sheep know My Voice
And the valley of death
Through which I shall lead them some day;
But no danger nor harm can touch one of them
For I will be with them alway."
1125;'Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus;F;"Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His Word;
Just to rest upon His promise;
Just to know, ""Thus saith the Lord.""

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
Oh, for grace to trust Him more!

Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to trust His cleansing Blood;
Just in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood.

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.

I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee!
Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end."
1126;Saved to the Uttermost;F;"Saved to the uttermost: I am the Lord's;
Jesus my Savior salvation affords;
Gives me His Spirit a witness within,
Whisp'ring of pardon, and saving from sin.
---[Chorus:1]---
Saved, saved, saved to the uttermost: 
Saved, saved by power divine;
Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost:
Jesus the Savior is mine!

Saved to the uttermost: Jesus is near;
Keeping me safely, He casteth out fear;
Trusting His promises now I am blest;
Leaning upon Him, how sweet is my rest.

Saved to the uttermost: this I can say,
""Once all was darkness, but now it is day;""
Beautiful visions of glory I see;
Jesus in brightness revealed unto me.

Saved to the uttermost: cheerfully sing
Loud hallelujahs to Jesus my King!
Ransomed and pardoned, 
redeemed by His Blood,
Cleansed from unrighteousness, 
   glory to God!"
1127;Bringing In The Sheaves;C;"Sowing in the morning,
Sowing seeds of kindness,
Sowing in the noontide 
And the dewy eve;
Waiting for the harvest,
And the time of reaping,
We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves.

Bringing in the sheaves,
Bringing in the sheaves,
We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves.
(2X)

Sowing in the sunshine,
Sowing in the shadows,
Fearing neither clouds 
Nor winter's chilling breeze;
By and by the harvest,
And the labor ended,
We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves.

Going forth with weeping,
Sowing for the Master,
Though the loss sustained 
Our spirit often grieves;
When our weeping's over,
He will bid us welcome,
We shall come rejoicing,
Bringing in the sheaves."
1128;Hold the Fort;C;"Ho, my comrades! see the signal,
Waving in the sky!
Reinforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh.
---[Chorus:1]---
""Hold the fort, for I am coming,""
Jesus signals still;
Wave the answer back to heaven,
""By Thy grace we will.""

See the mighty host advancing,
Satan leading on;
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone!

See the glorious banner waving!
Hear the trumpet blow!
In our Leader's name we'll triumph
Over ev'ry foe.

Fierce and long the battle rages,
But our help is near;
Onward comes our great Commander.
Cheer, my comrades, cheer."
1129;When The Battle's Over;F;"And when the battle's over
We shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown!
And when the battle's over
We shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown,
And when the battle's over
We shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

Must I be carried to the skies,
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed the bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?

Sure, I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord:
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word."
1130;Honey In The Rock;F;"Oh, my brother do you know 
     the Savior,
Who is wondrous,  kind and true?
He's the ""Rock of your salvation!""
There's Honey in the Rock for you.
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh, there's Honey in the Rock, 
     my brother,
There's Honey in the Rock for you;
Leave your sins for the Blood 
     to cover,
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Have you ""tasted that the Lord 
     is gracious?""
Do you walk in the way that's new?
Have you drunk from 
The living fountain?
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Do you pray unto God the Father,
""What wilt Thou have me to do?""
Never fear, He will surely answer:
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Then go out through the streets 
     and byways,
Preach the Word 
To the many or few;
Say to every fallen brother,
""There's Honey in the Rock for you."""
1131;Blessed Assurance;C;"Blessed assurance, 
Jesus is mine!
Oh, what a foretaste 
Of glory divine!

Heir of salvation, 
Purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, 
Washed in His Blood.

(This is my story, 
This is my song.
Praising my Saviour, 
All the day long; ) x 2

Perfect submission, 
Perfect delight!
Visions of rapture 
Now burst on my sight;

Angels, descending, 
Bring from above,
Echoes of mercy, 
Whispers of love.

Perfect submission, 
All is at rest!
I, in my Saviour, 
Am happy and blest;

Watching and waiting, 
Looking above,
Filled with His goodness, 
Lost in His love."
1132;Master, the Tempest Is Raging;C;"Master, the tempest is raging! 
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o'er-shadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh;
""Carest Thou not that we perish?""
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?
---[Chorus:1]---
""The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
Peace, be still!""
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
Or demons or men or whatever it be,
No water can swallow the ship where lies 
The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, be still! Peace be still! 
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, peace, be still!

Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
O waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul!
And I perish! I perish, dear Master; 
O hasten and take control!

Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast.
Linger, O blessed Redeemer, 
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
And rest on the blissful shore."
1133;Worthy the Lamb;Eb;"""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
The hosts of heaven sing,
As before the throne 
They make His praises ring;
""Worthy is the Lamb 
The book to open wide,
Worthy is the Lamb 
Who once was crucified.""
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh, this bleeding Lamb, 
Oh, this bleeding Lamb,
Oh, this dying Lamb, 
He was found worthy;
Oh, this bleeding Lamb, 
Oh, this bleeding Lamb,
Oh, this dying Lamb, 
He was found worthy.

Worthy is the Lamb 
Who shed His precious Blood
To restore a world 
To happiness and God;
""When no eye could pity 
And no arm could save,""
Jesus, for our ransom, 
Himself freely gave.

Worthy is the Lamb, 
The bleeding sacrifice 
Who for Adam's race 
Paid such a fearful price;
Worthy is the Lamb, 
The Paschal Lamb of God,
For the world received 
""Redemption thro' His Blood.""

""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
Let men and angels sing, 
""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
Let hallelujah's ring ;
And when life is past, 
Upon the golden shore,
""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
We'll shout forevermore."
1134;I Am Thine, Oh Lord;F;"I am Thine, oh Lord, 
I have heard Thy voice;
And it told Thy Love to me.
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me nearer, nearer, 
     nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, 
     nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now, 
    to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up 
    with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour,
That before Thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer, 
    and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of Love 
    that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy 
    that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee."
1137;Launch Out;C;"The mercy of God is an ocean divine,
A boundless and fathomless flood;
Launch out in the deep, cut away
     the shoreline,
And be lost in the fullness of God,
---[Chorus:1]---
Launch out into the deep,
Oh, let the shoreline go,
Launch out, launch out in the
     ocean divine,
Out where the full tides flow.

But many, alas! only stand 
    on the shore
And gaze on the ocean so wide;
They never have ventured its 
    depths to explore,
Or to launch on the fathomless tide.

And others just venture away 
    from the land,
And linger so near to the shore,
That the surf and the slime
      that beat over the strand,
Dash o'er them in floods evermore.

Oh,let us launch out on this
     ocean so broad,
Where the floods of salvation e'er flow;
Oh, let us be lost in the mercy of God,
Till the depths of His fullness we know."
1138;Pass Me Not;F;"Pass me not, O Gentle Saviour
Hear my humble cry
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by

Saviour, Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by.

Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief
Kneeling there in deep contrition
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit
Would I seek Thy face
Heal my wounded, broken spirit
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the Spring of all my comfort
More than life to me
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?"
1139;Sunlight, Sunlight;Eb;"I wandered in the shades of night,
Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee.
---[Chorus:1]---
Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today,
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way;
Since the Savior found,
     took away my sin
I have had the sunlight of His Love within.

Tho' clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows 'round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul.

While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigour on,
And leave the world behind.

I cross the wide-extended fields,
I journey o'er the plain,
And in the sunlight of His love
I reap the golden grain.

Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The Light that came to me;
Behold the brightness of His face,
Thro'out eternity."
1141;When We All Get to Heaven;Bb;"Sing the wondrous Love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace;
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He'll prepare for us a place.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will over-spread the sky;
But when trav'ling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev'ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold."
1142;What, Never Thirst Again?;Bb;"There flows from Calvary a stream
For every sinner's pain,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never thirst again.
---[Chorus:1]---
What! never thirst again?
No, never thirst again;
What! never thirst again? 
No, never thirst again,
For he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

Earth's fountains fair,
But mock our souls,
Like desert phantoms lure,
And they that drink,the fainter grow,
The keener thirst endure.

This stream from Calvary still flows,
To bless and cleanse and heal,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
New life and rest shall feel.

Oh, blessed stream of pure delight! 
Oh, balm for ev'ry pain! 
To thee I haste, for Jesus said,
I'll never thirst again."
1143;Rescue the Perishing;Bb;"Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity 
From sin and the grave;
Weep o'er the erring one,
Lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus
The mighty to save.
---[Chorus:1]---
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

Tho' they are slighting Him,
Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried
That grace can restore:
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken
Will vibrate once more.

Rescue the perishing,
Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor
The Lord will provide:
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand'rer
     a Savior has died."
1144;Where He Leads I'll Follow;Eb;"Sweet are the promises,
     kind is the word;
Dearer far than any message
     man ever heard;
Pure was the mind of Christ,
     sinless I see;
He the great example is,
     and pattern for me.
---[Chorus:1]---
Where He leads I'll follow,
Follow all the way;
Where He leads I'll follow,
Follow Jesus ev'ry day.

Sweet is the tender love
     Jesus hath shown,
Sweeter far than any love
     that mortals have known;
Kind to the erring one,
     faithful is He;
He the great example is
     and pattern for me

List to His loving words,
     ""Come unto Me!""
Weary, heavy laden,
     there is sweet rest for thee;
Trust in His promises,
     faithful and sure;
Lean upon the Savior,
     and thy soul is secure."
1145;I Must Tell Jesus;C;"I must tell Jesus all of my trials;
I cannot bear these burdens alone;
In my distress He kindly will help me;
He ever loves and cares for His own.
---[Chorus:1]---
I must tell Jesus!
I must tell Jesus!
I cannot bear my burdens alone;
I must tell Jesus!
I must tell Jesus!
Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.

I must tell Jesus all of my troubles;
He is a kind, compassionate Friend;
If I but ask Him, He will deliver,
Make of my troubles quickly an end.

Tempted and tried I need a great Saviour,
One who can help my burdens to bear;
I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus;
He all my cares and sorrows will share.

Oh how the world to evil allures me!
Oh how my heart is tempted to sin!
I must tell Jesus, and He will help me
Over the world the vict'ry to win."
1147;The Lord That Healeth Thee;Bb;"I am the LORD that healeth thee,
I am the LORD that healeth thee;
Jehovah Rapha is My Name:
For I am the LORD that healeth thee.

I am the LORD that healeth thee,
I am the LORD that healeth thee;
Sickness must flee at My command:
For I am the LORD that healeth thee.

I am the LORD that healeth thee,
I am the LORD that healeth thee;
The prayer of faith shall banish disease:
For I am the LORD that healeth thee.

I am the LORD that healeth thee,
I am the LORD that healeth thee;
My name is still as ointment poured forth:
For I am the LORD that healeth thee.

I am the LORD that healeth thee,
I am the LORD that healeth thee;
Come and be free from all your pains:
For I am the LORD that healeth thee."
1148;He Leadeth Me;C;"He leadeth me! 
Oh blessed thought!
Oh words with heav'nly 
     comfort fraught!
Whate'er I do, 
Where'er I be,
Still 'tis God's hand 
That leadeth me.

He leadeth me, He leadeth me,
By His own hand He leadeth me:
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.

Sometimes 'mid scenes 
Of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden's 
     bowers bloom,
By waters still, 
O'er troubled sea,
Still 'tis His hand 
That leadeth me!

Lord, I would clasp 
Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content, whatever lot I see, 
Since 'tis my God 
That leadeth me!

And when my task 
On earth is done,
When, by Thy grace, 
The victory's won,
E'en death's cold wave 
I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan 
     leadeth me."
1149;The Fire Is Burning;C;"I've been on Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
And I've satisfied my longing heart's desire;
For I caught a glimpse of glory bright,
And my soul is burning with the fire.

O the fire is burning,
     yes, 'tis brightly burning,
O 'tis burning, burning in my soul;
O the fire is burning,
     yes, 'tis brightly burning,
O 'tis burning, burning in my soul.

I will walk with Jesus, bless His name,
And to be like Him I ev'ry day aspire;
For His Love is like a heav'nly flame,
And my soul is burning with the fire.

I my all upon the altar lay,
As I to my closet lovingly retire;
And the flame consumes while 
     there I pray,
And my soul is burning with the fire.

By faith's eye I scan the ocean's foam,
And beyond I see the haven I desire;
There I view the beacon lights of home,
And my soul is burning with the fire."
1150;Old-Time Power;F;"They were in an upper chamber,
They were all with one accord,
When the Holy Ghost descended,
As was promised by our Lord.
---[Chorus:1]---
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
And baptize ev'ry one.

Yes, this pow'r from heav'n descended,
With the sound of rushing wind;
Tongues of fire came down upon them,
As the Lord said He would send.

Yes, this ""old-time"" pow'r was given 
To our fathers who were true;
This is promised to believers,
And we all may have it, too."
1151;The Glory-Land Way;F;"I'm in the way, 
The bright and shining way,
I'm in the glory-land way;
Telling the world 
That Jesus saves today,
Yes, I'm in the glory-land way.
---[Chorus:1]---
I'm in the glory-land way
I'm in the glory-land way;
Heaven is nearer, 
And the way groweth clearer,
For I'm in the glory-land way.

List to the call, 
The gospel call today,
Get in the glory-land way;
Wand'rers, come home, 
Oh, hasten to obey,
And get in the glory-land way.

Onward I go, 
Rejoicing in His love,
I'm in the glory-land way;
Soon I shall see Him 
In that home above,
Oh, I'm in the glory-land way."
1152;Are You Washed in the Blood?;G;"Have you been to Jesus 
     for the cleansing pow'r?
Are you washed in the Blood 
     of the Lamb?

Are you fully trusting 
     in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the Blood 
     of the Lamb?

Are you washed in the Blood,
In the soul-cleansing Blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless?
Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the Blood 
     of the Lamb?

Are you walking daily 
     by the Saviour's side?
Are you washed in the Blood 
     of the Lamb?

Do you rest each 
     moment in the Crucified?
Are you washed in the Blood 
     of the Lamb?

When the Bridegroom cometh
     will your robes be white?
Are you washed in the Blood 
     of the Lamb?

Will your soul be ready 
     for the mansions bright,
And be washed in the Blood 
     of the Lamb?

Lay aside the garments 
     that are stained with sin,
Are you washed in the Blood 
     of the Lamb?

There's a fountain flowing 
     for the soul unclean,
Oh be washed in the Blood 
     of the Lamb.

Yes, I'm washed in the Blood
In the soul-cleansing Blood 
     of the Lamb.
Yes, my garments are spotless,
     they are white as snow.
Yes, I'm washed in the Blood of the Lamb."
1153;We Shall See the King;Eb;"There's a blessed time that's coming,
     coming soon, 
It may be evening, morning or at noon,
The wedding of the bride, 
United with the groom,
We shall see the King when he comes.
---[Chorus:1]---
We shall see the King,
We shall see the King,
We shall see the King when He comes;
He is coming in pow'r,
We'll hail the blessed hour,
We shall see the King when He comes.

Are you ready should the Savior 
     call today?
Would Jesus say, 
""Well done,"" or ""Go away""?
My home is for the pure, 
The vile can never stay,
We shall see the King when comes.

Oh, my brother, are you ready for the call?
To crown your Savior King and Lord of all?
The Kingdoms of this world 
Shall soon before Him fall,
We shall see the King when He comes."
1154;Never Alone;Bb;"I've seen the light'ning flashing,
And heard the thunder roll;
I've felt sin's breakers dashing,
Trying to conquer my soul;
I've heard the voice of my Savior,
Telling me still to fight on;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.
---[Chorus:1]---
No, never alone! No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone! No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

The world's fierce winds are blowing 
Temptations sharp and keen;
I feel a peace in knowing
My Savior stands between;
He stands to shield me from danger,
When earthly friends are gone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

When in affliction's valley
I'm treading the road of care;
My Savior helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet, entangled with briars
Ready to cast me down,
My Savior whispers His promise, 
""I never will leave thee alone.""

He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side;
For me He opened the fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He's waiting in glory,
Seated upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone."
1156;Onward, Christian Solders;Eb;"Onward, Christian soldiers! 
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before,
Christ, the royal Master, 
Leads against the foe,
Forward into battle, 
See His banners go!
---[Chorus:1]---
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.

Like a mighty army 
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading 
Where the Saints have trod;
We are not divided, 
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never 
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, 
Which can never fail.

At the sign of triumph,
Satan's host doth flee, 
On, then Christian soldiers
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver,
At the shout of praise, 
Brothers, lift your voices
Loud your anthems raise!

Onward, then ye people! 
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honour, 
Unto Christ the King;
This through countless ages 
Men and angels sing."
1157;Victory Ahead;C;"When the hosts of Israel, led by God,
Round the walls of Jericho softly trod;
Trusting in the Lord, they felt the
     conqueror's tread,
By faith they saw the victory ahead.
---[Chorus:1]---
Victory ahead! Victory ahead!
Through the Blood of Jesus, 
     victory ahead;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I hear the conqueror's tread,
By faith I see the victory ahead.

David, with a shepherd's sling 
     and five stones,
Met the giant on the field all alone;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He knew what God had said,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Daniel prayed unto the Lord 
     thrice each day,
Then unto the lion's den led the way;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He did not fear or dread,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Often with the carnal mind I was tried,
Asking for deliverance oft I cried;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I reckoned I was dead,
By faith I saw the victory ahead.

When like those who've gone before 
     to that land,
By death's river cold and dark 
     I shall stand;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I will not fear or dread,
By faith I see the victory ahead."
1158;Waiting on the Lord;C;"Waiting on the Lord, 
      for the promise given;
Waiting on the Lord
      to send from heaven;
Waiting on the Lord, 
     by our faith receiving;
Waiting in the upper room.
---[Chorus:1]---
The power! the power!
Gives vict'ry over sin,
     and purity within;
The power! the power!
The pow'r they had at Pentecost.

Waiting on the Lord, 
    giving all to Jesus;
Waiting on the Lord,
     till from sin He frees us;
Waiting on the Lord 
    for the heav'nly breezes;
Waiting in the upper room.

Waiting on the Lord, 
     longing to mount higher;
Waiting on the Lord, 
     having great desire;
Waiting on the Lord 
     for the heav'nly fire;
Waiting in the upper room."
1159;Send The Light;F;"There's a call comes ringing 
O'er the restless wave,
Send the light! Send the light!
There are souls to rescue, 
There are souls to save,
Send the light! Send the light!
---[Chorus:1]---
Send the light, 
The blessed gospel light,
Let it shine from shore to shore!
Send the light, 
And let its radiant beams
Light the world forevermore.

We have heard 
The Macedonian call today
Send the light! Send the light!
And a golden offering 
At the cross we lay,
Send the light! Send the light!

Let us pray that grace 
May everywhere abound,
Send the light! Send the light!
And a Christ-like spirit 
Everywhere be found,
Send the light! Send the light!

Let us not grow weary 
In the work of love,
Send the light! Send the light!
Let us gather jewels 
For a crown above,
Send the light! Send the light!"
1160;I'll Go Where You Want Me To Go;Eb;"It may not be on the mountain's height,
Or over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle's front
My Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still, small voice He calls
To paths I do not know,
I'll answer dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I'll go where you want me to go.
---[Chorus:1]---
I'll go where you want me to go , dear Lord
O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord,
I'll be what you want me to be.

Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand'rer whom I should seek,
Oh Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide, 
Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I'll say what you want me to say.

There's surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth's harvest-fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life's short day
For Jesus, the Crucified.
So, trusting my all unto Thy care, 
I know Thou lovest me!
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what you want me to be."
1161;In The Cross;F;"Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."
1162;Send The Fire;Eb;"Thou Christ of burning, cleansing flame,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
Thy Blood bought gift today we claim,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
Look down and see this waiting host,
Give us the promised Holy Ghost,
We want another Pentecost,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

God of Elijah, hear our cry,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
He'll make us fit to live or die,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
To burn up every trace of sin,
To bring the light and glory in,
The revolution now begin,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

'Tis fire we want, for fire we plead,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
The fire will meet our every need,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
For strength to ever do the right,
For grace to conquer in the fight,
For power to walk in the world in white,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!"
1163;Throw Out The Life-Line;F;"Throw out the Life-Line 
Across the dark wave,
There is a brother 
Whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother! 
Oh, who then will dare
To throw out the Life-Line, 
His peril to share?
---[Chorus:1]---
Throw out the Life-Line! 
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is drifting away!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is sinking today.

Throw out the Life-Line 
With hand quick and strong;
Why do you tarry, 
Why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; 
Oh hasten today
And out with the Life-Boat! 
Away, then, away!

Throw out the Life-Line 
To danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish 
Where you've never been;
Winds of temptation 
And billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out 
Where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season 
Of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift 
To eternity's shore;
Haste then,my brother, 
No time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line 
And save them today."
1164;Our Lord's Return To Earth Again;F;"I am watching for the coming 
Of the glad millennial day,
When our blessed Lord shall come 
And catchHiswaiting Bride away;
Oh! my heart is filled with rapture 
As I labor, watch and pray,
For  the Lord is coming back 
     to earth again.
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh! our Lord is coming back 
     to earth again,
Yes, our Lord is coming back 
     to earth again;
Satan will be bound a thousand years,
We'll have no tempter then,
After Jesus shall come back 
     to earth again.

Jesus' coming back will be the answer
To earth's sorrowing cry,
For the knowledge of the Lord shall fill
The earth and sea and sky;
God shall take away all sickness 
And the sufferer's tears will dry,
When our Savior shall come back 
     to earth again.

Yes, the ransomed of the Lord shall come 
To Zion then with joy,
And in all His holy mountain 
Nothing hurts or shall destroy;
Perfect peace shall reign in every heart,
     and love without alloy,
After Jesus shall come back 
     to earth again.

Then the sin and sorrow, pain and death
     of  this dark world shall cease,
In a glorious reign with Jesus of a
     thousand years of peace;
All the earth is groaning, crying 
For that day of sweet release,
For our Jesus to come back 
     to earth again."
1165;Under The Blood;F;"Lord, keep my soul from day to day,
Under the Blood, under the Blood;
Take doubt and fear and sin away,
Under the precious Blood.
---[Chorus:1]---
Under the Blood, the precious Blood,
Under the cleansing, healing flood;
Keep me, Saviour, from day to day,
Under the precious Blood.

The sinner's refuge here alone,
Under the Blood, under the Blood;
Here Jesus makes salvation known,
Under the precious Blood.

Lord, with Thy self my spirit fill,
Under the Blood, under the Blood;
And work in me to do Thy will,
Under the precious Blood.

Sweet peace abides within the heart,
Under the Blood ,under the Blood;
And gifts divine their joy impart,
Under the precious Blood.

The Holy Spirit, hour by hour,
Under the Blood, under the Blood;
Exerts His sanctifying power,
Under the precious Blood."
1166;The Message of His Coming;Bb;"We're looking for His coming,
      in the clouds of heaven,
Coming back to earth 
      to catch away His own;
Then may we all be ready, 
      when midnight cry is given,
To go and reign with Christ 
      on His throne.
---[Chorus:1]---
Gladly may we herald the message 
Of His blessed appearing,
Soon He's coming in glory, 
Tell to one and all;
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, 
Why slumber when the end is nearing,
But get ready for the final call.

We're longing for the glory 
     that awaits the faithful,
Who shall overcome, 
     and ev'ry conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward, 
     the prize is life eternal
To all who win the fight over sin.

We're praying for the advent 
      of our blessed Savior,
Who has promised life 
      to all who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending, 
      the message being given,
And soon we'll see our Lord 
      face to face.

We see the signs appearing 
      of His blessed coming,
Lo, behold the fig leaves 
      now becoming green;
The gospel of His kingdom 
      has gone to ev'ry nation;
That we are near the end 
      can be seen."
1167;Wonderful Words Of Life;F;"Sing them over again to me,
Wonderful Words of Life;
Let me more of their beauty see,
Wonderful Words of Life.
Words of life and beauty,
Teach me faith and duty:

Beautiful Words, wonderful Words,
Wonderful Words of Life.
Beautiful Words, wonderful Words,
Wonderful Words of Life.

Christ, the blessed One, gives to all,
Wonderful Words of Life;
Sinner, list to the loving call,
Wonderful Words of Life.
All so freely given,
Wooing us to heaven:

Sweetly echo the Gospel call,
Wonderful Words of Life;
Offer pardon and peace to all,
Wonderful Words of Life.
Jesus, only Saviour,
Sanctify forever:

Words that come from the Heart of God,
Wonderful Words of Life;
Words that speak of the cleansing Blood,
Wonderful Words of Life.
Words of Life and Glory,
Tell the wondrous Story:"
1168;Yes, I Know!;F;"Come, ye sinners, lost and hopeless,
Jesus' Blood can make you free;
For He saved the worst among you,
When He saved a wretch like me.
---[Chorus:1]---
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' Blood can make the 
     vilest sinner clean.
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' Blood can make the 
     vilest sinner clean.

To the faint He giveth power,
Through the mountains makes a way;
Findeth water in the desert,
Turns the night to golden day.

In temptation He is near thee,
Holds the powers of hell at bay;
Guides you to the path of safety,
Gives you grace for every day.

He will keep thee while the ages
Roll throughout eternity;
Though earth hinders and hell rages,
All must work for good to thee."
1169;Hiding In Thee;Eb;"Oh safe to the Rock
That is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts
And sorrows would fly;
So sinful, so weary, 
Thine, Thine would I be;
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.
---[Chorus:1]---
Hiding in Thee, (my Saviour),
Hiding in Thee, (my Lord),
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noontide,
In sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation
Casts o'er me its power;
In the tempests of life,
On its wide heaving sea,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict,
When pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and
Breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials
Like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee,
Oh Thou Rock of my soul."
1170;My Saviour's Love;G;"I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could Love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.

How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful
Is my Saviour's Love for me!

For me it was in the garden
He prayed, ""Not My will, but Thine,""
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of Blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His Love for me."
1171;Tell Me The Old, Old Story;C;"Tell me the old,  old story 
Of unseen things above;
Of Jesus and His glory,  
Of Jesus and His love.
Tell me the story simply, 
As to a little child,
For I am weak and weary, 
And helpless and defiled.
---[Chorus:1]---
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story softly, 
That I may take it in,
That wonderful redemption,  
God's remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often, 
For I forget so soon,
The early dew of morning, 
Has passed away at noon.

Tell me the same old story 
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory 
Is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world's glory 
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell  me the old, old story: 
Christ Jesus makes thee whole."
1172;Come to the Feast;Ab;"""All things are ready,"" 
     Come to the feast!
Come, for the table now is spread;
Ye famishing, ye weary, come,
And thou shalt be richly fed.
---[Chorus:1]---
Hear the invitation. 
Come, ""whosoever will;""
Praise God for full salvation
For ""whosoever will.""

""All things are ready,"" 
     Come to the feast!
Come, for the door is open wide;
A place of honor is reserved
For you at the Master's side.

""All things are ready,"" 
     Come to the feast!
Come, while He waits 
To welcome thee;
Delay not while this day is thine,
Tomorrow may never be.

""All things are ready,"" 
     Come to the feast!
Leave ev'ry care and 
     worldly strife;
Come, feast upon the Love of God,
And drink everlasting life."
1173;I Will Sing Of My Redeemer;G;"I will sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous Love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.
---[Chorus:1]---
Sing, oh, sing, of my Redeemer,
With His Blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless Love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell

I will sing of my  Redeemer,
And His heavenly Love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be."
1174;Let The Lower Lights Be Burning;Ab;"Brightly beams our Father's mercy
From His lighthouse evermore,
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.
---[Chorus:1]---
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave!
Some poor fainting, struggling sea-man
You may rescue, you may save.

Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;
Some poor sailor tempest tossed,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost."
1175;The Sure Foundation;F;"There stands a Rock on shores of time
That rears to heav'n its head sublime;
That Rock is cleft, and they are blest
Who find within this cleft a rest.
---[Chorus:1]---
Some build their hopes on the 
     ever drifting sand,
Some on their fame, or their treasure, 
     or their land;
Mine's on a Rock that forever will stand,
Jesus, the ""Rock of Ages.""

That Rock's a cross, its arms outspread,
Celestial glory bathes its head;
To its firm base my all I bring,
And to the Rock of Ages cling.

That Rock's a tow'r, whose lofty height,
Illum'd with heav'n's unclouded light,
Opes wide its gate beneath the dome
Where saints find rest with Christ at home."
1177;'Tis Burning In My Soul;C;"God sent His mighty power 
    to this poor, sinful heart,
To keep me every hour, 
    and needful grace impart;

And since His Spirit came, 
    to take supreme control,
The Love enkindled flame 
    is burning in my soul.

'Tis burning in my soul, 
    'tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heavenly Love 
    is burning in my soul,

The Holy Spirit came, 
    all glory to His name!
The fire of heavenly Love 
    is burning in my soul.

Before the cross I bow, 
    upon the altar lay
A willing offering now, 
    my all from day to day.

My Savior paid the price,  
    my name He sweetly calls;
Upon the sacrifice the fire 
    from heaven falls.

No good that I have done, 
    His promise I embrace;
Accepted in the Son, 
    He saves me by His grace.

All glory be to God! 
    let hallelujahs roll;
His Love is shed abroad, 
    the fire is in my soul."
1178;Leaning On The Everlasting Arms;G;"What a fellowship, 
What a joy divine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
What a blessedness, 
What a peace is mine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Oh, how sweet to walk 
In this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
Oh, how bright the path 
Grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

What have I to dread, 
What have I to fear,
Leaning on the everlasting arms?
I have blessed peace 
With my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms."
1179;Victory;F;"Hallelujah, what a thought!
Jesus full salvation brought,
Victory, victory.
Let the powers of sin assail,
Heaven's grace can never fail,
Victory, victory.
---[Chorus:1]---
Victory,  yes, victory;
Hallelujah! I am free
Jesus gives me victory.
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He is all in all to me.

I am trusting in the Lord,
I am standing on His word,
Victory, victory.
I have peace and joy within,
Since my life is free from sin,
Victory, victory.

Shout your freedom everywhere,
His eternal peace declare,
Victory, victory.
Let us sing it here below,
In the face of every foe,
Victory, victory.

We will sing it on that shore,
When this fleeting life is o'er,
Victory, victory.
Sing it here, ye ransomed throng,
Start the everlasting song:
Victory, victory."
1180;His Yoke Is Easy;Ab;"The Lord is my Shepherd, 
I shall not want,
He maketh me down to lie
In pastures green, 
He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.
---[Chorus:1]---
His yoke is easy, 
His burden is light,
I've found it so, 
I've found it so;
He leadeth me 
By day and by night,
Where living waters flow.

My soul crieth out: 
""Restore me again,
And give me 
The strength to take
The narrow path 
     of righteousness,
E'en for Thine own 
     name's sake.""

Yea, though I should walk 
The valley of death,
Yet what should I fear from ill?
For Thou art with me and 
Thy rod and staff support me still."
1181;Jesus Loves Even Me;F;"I am so glad that 
Our Father in heav'n
Tells of His Love in the Book 
He has giv'n,
Wonderful things 
In the Bible I see;
This is the dearest 
That Jesus Loves me.
---[Chorus:1]---
I am so glad that Jesus Loves me,
Jesus Loves me, Jesus Loves me:
I am so glad that Jesus Loves me,
Jesus Loves even me.

Tho' I forget Him 
And wander away,
Still He doth Love me 
Wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving 
Arms would I flee,
When I remember 
That Jesus Loves me.

Oh, if there's only one 
Song I can sing,
When in His beauty 
I see the  great King,
This shall my song 
In eternity be:
""Oh, what a wonder 
That Jesus Loves me.""

Jesus Loves me,
And I know I love Him;
Love brought Him down
My poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was Love made 
Him die on the tree;
Oh, I am certain that 
Jesus Loves me!

If one should ask of me, 
How can I tell?
Glory to Jesus, 
I know very well!
God's Holy Spirit 
With mine doth agree,
Constantly witnessing 
Jesus Loves me.

In this assurance 
I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus, 
I know I am blessed;
Satan, dismayed, from my 
Soul now doth flee,
When I just tell him that
Jesus Loves me."
1182;Beautiful;G;"Beautiful robes so white, 
Beautiful land of light,
Beautiful home so bright,
Where there shall come no night;
Beautiful crown I'll wear,
Shining with stars o'er there,
Yonder in mansions fair, 
Gather us there.
---[Chorus:1]---
Beautiful robes, beautiful land, 
Beautiful home, beautiful band,
Beautiful crown, shining so fair,
Beautiful mansion bright,
Gather us there.

Beautiful tho't to me,
We shall forever be 
Thine in eternity,
When from this world we're free;
Free from its toil and care,
Heavenly joys to share,
Let me cross over there;
This is my pray'r.

Beautiful things on high,
Over in yonder sky,
Thus I shall leave this shore,
Counting my treasures o'er;
Where we shall never die,
Carry me by and by,
Never to sorrow more,
Heavenly shore."
1183;Sitting At The Feet Of Jesus;F;"Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
O what words I hear him say!
Happy place! so near, so precious!
May it find me there each day;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
I would look upon the past;
For His Love has been so gracious,
It has won my heart at last.

Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Where can mortal be more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And, when weary, find sweet rest;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
There I love to weep and pray,
While I fromHisfullness gather
Grace and comfort every day.

Bless me, oh my Savior, bless me,
As I sit low at Thy feet;
Oh look down in love upon me,
Let me see Thy face so sweet,
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
Make me holy as He is;
May I prove I've been with Jesus,
Who is all my righteousness."
1184;Nothing But The Blood;F;"What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.

Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.

For my cleansing this I see
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus;
For my pardon, this my plea
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus."
1185;I've Believed The True Report;Ab;"I've believed the true report,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the outer court,
Oh glory be to God!

I am all on Jesus' side,
On the altar sanctified,
To the world and sin I've died,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I have passed the riven veil,
Where the glories never fail,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I am living in the presence of the King.

I'm a king and priest to God,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
By the cleansing of the Blood,
Oh glory be to God!

By the Spirit's pow'r and light,
I am living day and night,
In the holiest place so bright,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I have passed the outer veil,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
Which did once God's light conceal,
Oh glory be to God!

But the Blood has brought me in
To God's holiness so clean,
Where there's death to self and sin,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I'm within the holiest pale,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the inner veil,
Oh glory be to God!

I am sanctified to God
By the power of the Blood,
Now the Lord is my abode,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!"
1186;Amazing Grace;G;"Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas Grace that taught
My heart to fear
And Grace my fears relieved
How precious did
That Grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers
Toils and snares
I have already come
'Twas Grace that brought
Me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home

And when this heart
And flesh shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess
Within the Veil
A life of joy and peace

When we've been there 
Ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days
To sing God's praise
Than when we first begun"
1187;At the cross, at the cross;F;"Alas, and did my Saviour Bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred Head
For such a worm as I?

At the Cross, at the Cross
Where I first saw the light,
And the burdens of my heart 
rolled away,

It was there by faith, 
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day.

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
Tis all that I can do!"
1188;Come Unto Me;C;"Hear the blessed Saviour 
     calling the oppressed,
""Oh ye heavy-laden, come 
     to Me and rest;
Come, no longer tarry, 
I your load will bear,
Bring Me ev'ry burden, 
     bring Me ev'ry care.""
---[Chorus:1]---
Come unto Me, 
I will give you rest;
Take My yoke upon you, 
Hear Me and be blest;
I am meek and lowly,
Come and trust My might;
Come, My yoke is easy,
And My burden's light.

Are you disappointed, 
      wand'ring here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt 
      and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle
      in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus, 
He will give you rest.

Stumbling on the mountains 
      dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling tow'rd the pit
      of hell's consuming flame,
By the pow'rs of sin 
      deluded and oppressed, 
Hear the tender Shepherd,
""Come to Me and rest.""

Have you by temptation 
      often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness 
      brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you, 
      if you'll claim His best,
In the Holy Spirit, 
He will give you rest."
1189;Where He Leads Me;F;"Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him,
All the way.

I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
""Take thy cross and follow,
     follow Me.""

I'll go with Him in the rapture,
I'll go with Him in the rapture,
I'll go with Him in the rapture,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
And go with me, with me all the way."
1192;Sweet By And By;F;"There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days."
1193;When I Survey;Eb;"When I survey the wondrous cross,
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His Blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all."
1194;The Great Physician;Eb;"The great Physician now is near;
The sympathizing Jesus.
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus.

Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

Your many sins are all forgiven,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to heaven,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

All glory to the risen Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Saviour's name,
I love the name of Jesus.

His name dispels my guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus,
Oh, how my soul delights to hear,
The charming name of Jesus.

And when to that bright world above
We rise to be with Jesus,
We'll sing around the throne of love,
His name, the name of Jesus."
1196;The Old Account Settled;Ab;"There was a time on earth, 
When in the book of heaven
An old account was standing
For sins yet unforgiven;
My name was at the top, 
And many things below,
I went unto the keeper, 
And settled long ago.
---[Chorus:1]---
Long ago, long ago, 
Yes the old account 
Was settled long ago;
And the record's clear today, 
For He washed my sins away,
When the old account 
Was settled long ago.

The old account was large, 
And growing every day,
For I was always sinning, 
And never tried to pay;
But when I looked ahead, 
And saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle,
I settled long ago.

When at the judgment bar, 
I stand before my King,
And He the book will open, 
He cannot find a thing;
Then will my heart be glad, 
While tears of joy will flow
Because I had it settled, 
And settled long ago.

When in that happy home, 
My Savior's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story, 
And praise Him for His love;
I'll not forget that book, 
With pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled, 
And settled long ago.

O sinner, seek the Lord, 
Repent of all your sin,
For thus He hath commanded, 
If you would enter in;
And then if you should live 
A hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it, 
You settled long ago."
1198;Revive Us Again;F;"We praise Thee, O God, 
For the Son of Thy love, 
For Jesus who died
And is now gone above.
---[Chorus:1]---
Hallelujah! 
Thine the glory,
Hallelujah! amen; 
Hallelujah!
Thine the glory, 
Revive us again.

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior,
And scattered our night.

All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins
And has cleansed ev'ry stain.

Revive us again;
Fill each heart with Thy love,
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above."
1199;Take The Name Of Jesus With You;F;"Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it everywhere you go.

Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

Take the name of Jesus with you,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

Oh the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him
When our journey is complete."
1200;Jesus Loves Me;C;"Jesus Loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak but He is strong.

Yes, Jesus Loves me,
Yes, Jesus Loves me,
Yes, Jesus Loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus Loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin.
Let His little child come in.

Jesus Loves me! Loves me still,
Though I'm very weak and ill;
From His shining throne on high,
Comes to watch me where I lie.

Jesus Loves me; He will stay
Close beside me all the way;
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high."
1201;Look To The Lamb Of God;F;"If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God;
He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.
---[Chorus:1]---
Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,
For He alone is able to save you;
Look to the Lamb of God.

When Satan tempts, 
and doubts and fears assail,
Look to the Lamb of God;
You in His strength 
Shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you aweary, 
Does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer 
And fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows 
On your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow 
Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God."
1202;Blest Be The Tie That Binds;F;"Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, 
    our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again."
1203;Sweet Hour Of Prayer;C;"Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
The joy I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return. 
With such I hasten to the place
Where God, my Saviour, shows His face
And gladly take my station there,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear,
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer."
1204;When They Ring The Golden Bells;Eb;"There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore 
By faith's decree;
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.
---[Chorus:1]---
Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee.
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

We shall know no sin nor sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond
    the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
When in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the spirit
    to be free
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Aiden,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me."
1206;Joy To The World!;C;"Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,

Joy to the world! the Savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills
    and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, and wonders of His love."

Pleased as man with men to appear,
Jesus our Immanuel here.

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace,
Hail the Sun of righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Ris'n with healing in His wings:
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.

Come, Desire of nations, come!
Fix in us Thy humble home:
Rise, the woman's conqu'ring seed,
Bruise in us the serpent's head;
Adam's likeness now efface,
Stamp Thine image in its place:
Second Adam from above,
Reinstate us in Thy love."

How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by:
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary;
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Oh holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend on us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today.
We hear the holy angels
The great glad tidings tell;
Oh come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel."
1210;Away In A Manger;F;"Away in a manger,
No crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay,

Asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing,
The Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
No crying He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle,
Till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever,
And love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And take us to heaven,
To live with Thee there."

Why not? Why not?
Why not come to Him now?

What do you hope, dear brother,
To gain by a further delay?
There's no one to save you but Jesus.
There's no other way but His way;

Do you not feel, dear brother,
His Spirit now striving within?
Oh, why not accept His salvation,
And throw off your burden of sin?

Why do you wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Savior is longing to bless you;
There's danger and death in delay."

Of sacrifice laid?
Your heart, 
Does the Spirit control?
You can only be blest

In the light of His Word,
And have peace and 
Contentment alway?
You must do His sweet will, 
To be free from all ill,
On the altar your all you must lay.

Oh, we never can know 
What the Lord will bestow
Of the blessings for which 
We have prayed,
Till our body and soul

Jesus let me know
That I was His very own!

The Scriptures tell the Story
Of Enoch long ago
Who walked with God and was not
Yet no-one seemed to know
That he had been translated
For death he did not see
And walked off with our Saviour
Into Eternity.

One day God's servant Moses
Obeying God's command
Went up the distant summit
To view the Promised Land
The people in the valley
Beheld his face no more
For he had gone forever
To Heaven's Eternal Shore

When God did take Elijah
From troubles here below
Up to his Home in Glory
Eternal rest to know
He sent the weary prophet
A Chariot of Flame
And lifted him to Heaven
Oh, Glory to His Name!

When God did send His Prophet
Br' Branham here below
To start a Great Revival
All o'er the earth to go
And then the Seventh Angel
His message did proclaim
To take us into Glory
Let's Magnify His Name!"

To reveal His Majesty
So I know if I'll give Him control
He'll be born in me

Unlikely the place for His Word to unfold

But if I'll just yield this vessel
And let Him have His way
From glory unto glory
He'll change me day by day"

Down here and planning ahead,
So busy with their fortunes
They forgot what Jesus said:

About the wars and earthquakes
And the fig tree's budding leaves,
But there's a group of people
Getting ready to leave!

Ready to leave 
In a twinkling of an eye,
Making investments
In the bank up in the sky!

I've made preparations -
Not a reason to grieve.
Are you in that number
Getting ready to leave?

Sinner, what's the reason
For your needless delay -
While you're hesitating,
Christ could come just any day!

Heed the Spirit's calling,
Make your way to Calvary,
And get in that number
Getting ready to leave!"

The pathway is narrow,
But He leads me on;
I walk in His shadow,
My fears are all gone.
My spirit grows stronger,
Each moment, each day,
For Jesus is leading
Each step of the way."
1328;Please let me walk with You, Jesus;F;"I've been on the mountains with Jesus
And I've been in the valley so low;
But there's never one time that He failed me
For to Him with my troubles I'd go

Oh please, let me walk with You Jesus
Don't ever leave me alone.
For without You I can never -
I can never make Heaven my Home!

You found me when I was so lonely,
You found me when I was so low.
You found me when no-one could help me;
When no-one knew just where to go.

If I had all the wealth of this world,
And all that money could buy;
But I had not the Love of my Saviour,
I'd rather be dead than alive!"

All the time!

""Come and dine,"" the Master calleth
""Come and dine!""
You may feast at Jesus' table all the time!

He Who fed the multitude,
Turned the water into wine,
To the hungry calleth now,
""Come and dine.""

The disciples came to land,
Thus obeying Christ's command;
For the Master called to them,
""Come and dine""

There they found their heart's desire
Bread and fish upon the fire;
Thus He satisfies the hungry 
Ev'ry time.

Soon the Lamb will take His Bride,
To be ever at His side;
All the host of Heaven will assembled be.

All the saints in spotless white,
And with Jesus they will feast eternally!"

In great sorrow He died
The giver of life was He
Yet my Lord was despised
And rejected of men
This Jesus of Calvary

He was wounded for our transgressions
He was bruised for our iniquities
Surely He bore our sorrows
And by His stripes we are healed

Came the leper to Christ
Saying ""Surely I know that Thou 
Lord canst make me whole!""
When his great faith was seen
Jesus said: ""Yes I will.""
And touched him and made him clean

He has healed my sick soul
Made me every wit whole
And He'll do the same for you
He's the same yesterday
And today and for aye
This healer of men today"

Stood an old rugged Cross,
The emblem of suff'ring and shame;

Where the Dearest and Best,
For a world of lost sinners 
Was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged Cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged Cross,
And exchange it some day
For a crown.

Oh, that old rugged Cross,
So despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;

For the dear Lamb of God,
Left His Glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In the old rugged Cross,
Stained with Blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;

For 'twas on that old Cross,
Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

To the old rugged Cross,
I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach 
Gladly bear;

Then He'll call me some day,
To my home far away,
Where His Glory forever
I'll share."

My Saviour forever;

He plunged me to victory;
Beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing;
Of His cleansing pow'r revealing;
How He made the lame to walk again;
And caused the blind to see;

And then I cried, ""Dear Jesus;
Come and heal my broken spirit"";
And somehow Jesus came and brought;
To me the victory.

I heard about a mansion;

And some sweet day I'll sing up there;

Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When no one but Christ could help,
Love lifted me.
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When no one but Christ could help,
Love lifted me.

All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I'll cling,
In His blessed Presence live, 
Ever His praises sing.

Love so mighty and so true,
Merits my soul's best songs,
Faithful, loving service too,
To Him belongs.

Souls in danger, look above,

Billows His will obey;

Be saved today."

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
Sweetest name I know,
Fills my every longing,
Keeps me singing as I go.

All my life was wrecked
By sin and strife,
Discord filled my heart with pain.
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
Stirred the slumb'ring chords again.

Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting 'neath His sheltering wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing.

Though sometimes He leads
Through waters deep,
Trials fall across my way,
Though sometimes the path seems
Rough and steep,
See His footprints all the way.

Soon He's coming back to 
Welcome me,
Far beyond the starry sky,
I shall wing my flight,
To worlds unknown
I shall reign with Him on high."

To feast with the King,
To dine as His guests,
How blessed these pilgrims are!
Beholding His hallowed face,
Aglow with light divine;
Blest partakers of His Grace,
As gems in His crown to shine.

Since Jesus has set me free,
I'm happy as heart can be,
No longer I bear,
The burden of care,
His yoke is so sweet to me.
My soul was as black as night,
But darkness has taken flight,
Now I shout the victory,
For Jesus has set me free.

I look on the great white throne,
Before it the ransomed stand,
No longer are tears, no sorrow is known
Nor death in that goodly land;
My Saviour has gone before,
Preparing the way for me;
Soon we'll meet to part no more,
Through time and eternity.

The gates of that Holy Place,
Stand open by night and day,
O look to the Lord,
Who ""giveth more grace"",
Whose love has prepared the way.
A home in those mansions fair
His hand hath reserved for all.
For the wedding feast prepare,
Obeying His gracious call.

Oh, Jesus is coming soon,
Our trials will then be o'er,
What if our Lord, 
This moment should come
For those who are free from sin?
Then would it bring you joy?
Or sorrow and deep despair?
When our Lord in glory comes,
We'll meet Him up in the air"

From my heart, and now He keeps me
By His power.
Though all the world forsake me,
And Satan tempts me sore,
Through Jesus I shall safely reach
The goal; Hallelujah!

Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith 
And do His blessed will;

Where rivers of delight shall
Ever roll. Hallelujah!"

Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His Word,
Forgiven, He lifted me.

His brow was pierced with 
    many a thorn,
His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief forlorn,
In love He lifted me.

And with my soul I know 'tis well,
Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
He should have lifted me."

Lay all your burdens
Down at His feet,

Earth's joys grow dim,

Change and decay
In all around I see,
O Thou who changest not,
Abide with me.

I need Thy presence,
Ev'ry passing hour,
What but Thy grace can
Foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself
My guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine,
Lord,  Abide with me.

I fear no foe with Thee
At hand to bless,
I have no weight,
No tears, no bitterness.
Where is death's sting,
Where grave, thy victory?
In triumph still if 
Thou abide with me.

Keep Thou Thy cross 
Before my closing eyes,
Shine through the gloom and
Point me to the skies.
Heaven's morning breaks 
And earth's vain shadows flee.
In life, in death, Oh Lord,
Abide with me."

Let Him lead me where He will,
I will go without a murmer,
And His footsteps follow still.

I must have the Saviour with me,
For my faith at best is weak,
He can whisper words of comfort,
That no other voice can speak.

I must have the Saviour with me,
In the onward march of life,
Through the tempest and the sunshine,
Through the battle and the strife.

I must have the Saviour with me,
And His Eye the way must guide,
Till I reach the vale of Jordan,
Till I cross the rolling tide."

When the courts of heaven ring."

Close to Thy breast,

Haven of Rest.

Nearer, still nearer,
Nothing I bring,
Naught as an offering,
To Jesus, my King.
Only my sinful,
Now contrite heart,
Grant me the cleansing
Thy Blood doth impart.

Nearer, still neaer,
Lord to be Thine,
Sin, with its follies,
I gladly resign,
All of its pleasures,
Pomp and its pride,
Give me but Jesus,
My Lord crucified.

Nearer, still nearer,

Till all its struggles
And trials are past.
Then through eternity 
Ever I'll be,
Nearer, My Saviour,
Still nearer to Thee."

The world could not help me,
No comfort I found,
But now like the birds
And the sunbeams of spring,
I'm free and rejoicing
I walk with the King.

Come into your life.
The joy of salvation
To you He would bring,
Come into the sunlight
And walk with the King."

Peace, peace, sweet peace,
Wonderful gift from above,
Oh, wonderful, wonderful peace,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

By Christ on the cross peace was made,
My debt by His death was all paid,
No other foundation is laid,
For peace, the gift of God's love.

When Jesus as Lord I had crowned,
My heart with this peace did abound,
In Him the rich blessing I found,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

And as I keep close to His side,
There's nothing but peace doth betide
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love."

He will provide,
God will take care of you,
No good you ask 
Will be denied,

Of the thirst I felt within.
---[Chorus:1]---
Hallelujah, I have found Him,
Whom my soul so long has craved,
Jesus satisfies my longings,
Through His Blood I now am saved.

Feeding on the husks around me,
Till my strength was almost gone,
Longed my soul for something better,
Only still to hunger on.

Poor I was and sought for riches,
Something that would satisfy,
But the dust I gathered round me,
Only mocked my soul's sad cry.

Well of water, ever springing,
Bread of Life so rich and free,
Untold wealth that never faileth,
My Redeemer is to me."

His returning,

It may be night or noon,
We know, He's coming soon.

The signs around, in earth and air,
Or painted on the starlit sky,
God's faithful witnesses declare,
That coming of the Saviour 
Draweth nigh.

The dead in Christ who 'neath us lie,
In countless numbers all shall rise,
When through the portals of the sky,
He shall come to prepare our Paradise.

And we who, living, yet remain,
Caught up, shall meet our faithful Lord.
This hope we cherish not in vain,

My rest a stone,
Yet in my dreams I'd be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee (2x)
Nearer to Thee.

There let my way appear,
Steps unto heaven,
All that Thou sendest me,
In mercy given,
Angels to beckon me,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, (2x)
Nearer to Thee.

Then with my waking thoughts,
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs,
Bethel I'll raise,
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee, (2x)
Nearer to Thee.

Cleaving the sky,

Upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to Thee, (2x)
Nearer to Thee."

To cleanse and to heal,
And newness of life to impart.

That longed-for resemblance,
Once more to regain,
Thy comeliness put upon me.

I want to be marked for Thine own,
Thy seal on my forehead to wear,
And have that new name
On the mystic white stone,
Which none but Thyself canst declare.

I want by my aspect serene,
My actions and words to declare,
My treasure is placed
In a country unseen,
My heart's best affections are there.

To glorify Thee till I die,
Then calmly to yield up 
My soul to Thy care,
When called to Thy service on high."

Oh, how I love Jesus,
Because He first Loved me.

It tells me of a Saviour's Love,
Who died to set me free,
It tells me of His precious Blood,
The sinner's perfect plea.

It tells me what my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

It tells of One whose loving heart,
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part,
That none can bear below."

Yet how He was, so bruised and torn.
So as a Lamb, He had been born,
All dignity, from Him was shorn.
He gave them leave, His flesh to pierce.
What did they think, those men so fierce?
Victor alone, of Calvary,
The dearest Price, would set us free.
Just as He said, as it was wrote,
He did descend, and death was smote.
Early that day, the Sharon Rose, 
Fresh with the dawn, brought soul repose.

Whose glory fills, both earth and sky.
The Lord of Life, would call to thee.
List'to His Voice, from death be free."

Were brought before a tyrant's throne
They were told that he
Would spare their lives
If they would renounce
The name of Christ

The Son of God, they would not deny
Like a great angelic choir sings
I can almost hear their voices ring

I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength, With all I am,
I will seek to honour His commands,
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

Now the years have come
And the years have gone
And the cause of Jesus still goes on
Now our time has come
To count the cost
To reject this world
To embrace the cross
And one by one let us live our lives
For the One who died to give us life
Till the trumpet sounds on the final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say:

To the Lamb of God who bore my pain
Who took my place
Who wore my shame
I will seek to honor His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb"

The life style changed from natural to spiritual
To put away everything that's carnal
And the only goal you see is to be perfect just like He
You feel the life growing inside of you.

Now the truth and way I know
The growth of life in seven steps would show
That it's from faith to perfect love
Then God descends like a dove
To crown the man for attaining perfection.

All the while this is what I see
Christ in you is the mystery
To overcome this human flesh
That's the man that God would bless
Who overcomes I would grant to wear a crown.

More than I understand...only You.

With a Word You spoke the heavens into place
Scattered the stars and gave the earth it's frame.
What is man that You should touch him with Your grace?
And who am I, O Lord, that You should know my name?"
1535;I'll see you in the Rapture;C;"If we never meet again, 
On this earth my precious friend
If to God you have been true 
And lived above all sin

Then for us there'll be a greeting, 
For there's going to be a meeting
I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day.

I'll see you in the Rapture, 
See you in the Rapture
I'll see you at that meeting in the air 

There with our blessed Saviour
We'll live and reign forever
I'll see you in the Rapture 
Some sweet day.

To my loved ones let me say, 
There will surely come a day
When the Lord will come again 
And catch His Bride away

So get ready now to meet Him 
And with Hallelujah greet Him
I'll see you in the rapture some sweet day."
1536;I'm Free;F;"So long I searched For life's meaning 
Enslaved by the world and my greed 
Then the door of my prison
Was opened by Love
For the ransom was paid, 
Now I am free

I'm free from the fear of tomorrow
I'm free from the guilt of my past 
I've traded my shackles
for a glorious song
I'm free - Praise the Lord, free at last

I am free from the guilt that I carried 
From the dull empty life - I'm set free
For when I met Jesus,
He made me complete
He forgot the foolish child I used to be"

Without You holding my hand"

You uphold the one who feels forsaken

And I will sing to the maker of Heaven and Earth

We've got the Power
In the Name of Jesus
We've got the Power
In the Name of the Lord

Though Satan rages
We will not be defeated
We've got the Power

While the dew is still on the roses
And the Voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses.

And He walks with me, 
And He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.

He speaks, and the sound of His Voice,
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be falling,
But He bids me go; through the voice of His woe
His Voice to me is calling"

God cannot solve it
There is no mountain too tall

There is no sorrow too deep 
He cannot soothe it

If He carried the weight of the world
Upon His Shoulders
I know my brother 
That He will carry you,

If He carried the weight of the world
Upon His Shoulders 
I know my sister 
That He will carry you.

He said come unto me
All who are weary
And I will give you rest"
1548;I Sing;Bb;"Why should I feel discouraged, 
why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, 
and long for heaven and home,

When Jesus is my portion?
 My constant friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow,
 and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, 
and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

""Let not your heart be troubled,"" 
His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, 
I lose my doubts and fears;

Though by the path He leadeth,
 but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, 
and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow,
 and I know He watches me.

Whenever I am tempted,
 whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, 
when hope within me dies,

I draw the closer to Him, 
from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, 
and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow,
and I know He watches me."

Pointing souls to Calvary to the crimson flow
Many arrows pierce my soul from without, within
But my Lord leads me on, thro' Him I must win"

1552;In Christ Alone;Eb;"In Christ alone 
My hope is found
He is my light,
My strength, my song

This Cornerstone, 
This solid Ground
Firm through the fiercest 
drought and storm

What heights of Love
What depths of peace
When fears are stilled, 
When strivings cease!

My Comforter, 
My All in All
Here in the Love of Christ
I stand

In Christ alone
Who took on flesh
Fulness of God in 
Helpless Babe!

This gift of Love 
And righteousness
Scorned by the ones 
He came to save

Till on that cross,
As Jesus died
The wrath of God
Was satisfied

For every sin 
on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ
I live!

There in the ground 
His body lay
Light of the world 
by darkness slain

Then bursting forth 
In glorious day
Up from the grave 
He rose again

And as He stands
In victory
Sin's curse has lost
Its grip on me

For I am His 
And He is mine
Bought with the precious
Blood of Christ

No guilt in life
No fear in death
This is the power 
of Christ in me

From life's first cry
to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

No power of hell, 
No scheme of man
Can ever pluck me 
from His Hand

Till He returns
or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ
I stand"

That the cross would not be heavy

And the adversary says 'Give In'

1564;The Old Rugged Cross made the difference;;"T'was a life filled with aimless desperation
Without hope walked the shell of a man
Then a Hand with a nailprint stretched downward
Just one touch then a new life began

And the old rugged cross made the difference
In a life bound for heartache and defeat
I will praise Him forever and ever
For the cross made the difference for me

Barren walls echoed harshness and anger
Little faces ran in terror to hide
Now those walls ring with love,
warmth and laughter
Since the Giver of Life moved inside

There's a room filled with sad, ashen faces
Without hope death has wrapped them in gloom
But at the side of a saint there's rejoicing
For Life can't be sealed in a tomb"

""Oh, I know that I can make it
I know that I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your Hands.""

With Jesus I can take it!
With Him I know I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your hands!

So when your test and trials
They seem to get you down
And all your friends and loved ones
Are nowhere to be found

What is waiting there,
Though my mind can't conceive 
All that He's prepared
There the blind will see the sun,
What was old will be young,
And the lame, they will run 
All over the streets of that City

There is one Faith, one Hope, and one Baptism
One God and Father of all
There is one Church, one Body, one Life in the Spirit

And He gave to Simon Peter
And to all of His Bride
The keys of the Kingdom so darkness would never prevail
And if we walk in the Light
In the end-time Message of Grace
We'll come out rejoicing and scatter the darkness away

In good pastures He will shepherd His people
On the mountains feeds His sheep
He will lead the poor and afflicated
To the prisoner brings release

But He'll not forsake His people
He'll claim His sheep for His own

And then to turn around and lose your soul?
Store your treasures in Heaven not Earth

They just lost their dearest Friend
All that He said, now He was dead
So this was the way it would end

The dreams they had dreamed were not what they'd seemed
Now He was dead and gone
The garden, the jail, the hammer, the nail
How could a night  be so long?

The angel, the star, the kings from afar
The wedding, the water, the wine
Now it was done, they'd taken her Son
Wasted before His time

She knew it was true, she'd watched Him die too
She'd heard them call Him just a man
But deep in her heart she knew from the start
Somehow her Son would live again

Then came the morning
Night turned into day 
The stone was rolled away
Hope rose with the dawn

Then came the morning
Shadows vanished before the sun
Death had lost and life had won
For morning had come

Morning has broken like
The first Morning
The stone was rolled away
Hope rose with the dawn

Death had lost and life had won
For morning had come"

It's a straight and narrow pathway,
With no detours and no byways,
But over the next hill we'll be home.

From the Prophets I've been hearing,
I would say the End is nearing,
For I see familiar Landmarks all along.
By the dream that I've been dreaming,
There will come a great Redeeming,
And over the next Hill we'll be home.

By the turn the Tide is taking,
I'd say there's no mistaking,
That over the next Hill we'll be home.
There's a Place that we are nearing,
That so many have been fearing,
But over the next Hill we'll be home.

When we get there with our Token,
That we'll find the gate wide open,
And there'll be a refuge from the coming storm,
For the way's been long and weary,
But at last the End is nearing,
And over the next Hill we'll be home.
And over the next Hill we'll be home."
1588;By the Way of he Cross;;"Condemned to die on a cross
For crimes he had done
He was guilty - everyone could see.
But his destiny was changed
As he looked at Christ and said,
""When Your kingdom comes, remember me.""
In Paradise that day, he stood
Just like the Lord had said he would
Surrounded by those who had gone before.

One said, ""Friend, how did you come? 
What are the deeds you have done?""
With tears in his eyes,
    I can hear him reply, 
""There are no merits to my name
No works that I can claim.
He who brought me here 
     told me to say...

I have come by the way of the cross.
I have come by the way of the cross.
It is nothing I have done.
It's the suffering of God's Son.
I have come by the way of the cross.""

I had nothing to claim
But my guilt and my shame.
Hopelessly lost, I could not find my way.
Till His glorious light of love 
    shone down on me.
His mercy washed all my sin away!
And what He did for me that day
Was a price that I could not pay.
By His grace, I too can say
    - forever say...

I have come by the way of the cross.
I have come by the way of the cross.
It is nothing I have done.
It's the suffering of God's Son.
I have come by the way.....

I see millions gathered 'round the throne
From every kindred and tongue -
Those redeemed 
  by the blood of the Lamb!
As they cast their crowns down at His feet
This will be their story 
     -This will be their song,

We have come by the way of the cross.
We have come by the way of the cross.
It is nothing I have done.
It's the suffering of God's Son.
We have come by the way of the cross.
Of the cross

Somebody said He'll soon be here, the Lord's on His way
Martha ran to Him and then she cried
Lord if you had been here You could have healed him
He'd still be alive

But You're four days late and all hope is gone
Lord we don't understand why you've waited so long
But His way is God's way Not yours or mine
Isn't it great, when He's four days late
He's still on time

Jesus said Martha show me the grave, but she said Lord
You don't understand He's been there four days
The grave stone was rolled back, Then Jesus cried
Lazarus come forth then somebody said
He's alive, he's alive

You may be fighting a battle of fear

1606;quote;;"373. And will every true
 believer do the works that Jesus said, 
as stated in St. John 14:12

(Not exactly. No.): heal the sick, cast out 
devils, raise the dead (I don't think that's in
 St. John 14, but it's all right. It's Mark 16.),
or--or are--is this only to be Elijah? Must the
 believer do all that--of this--do really--that really
 believe?

And if he really is a real believer, 
will he raise the dead and do 
great miracles?
Now, that is among the believers. See?
 Every man doesn't have those gifts, and 
don't mean that just one person will do it; 
there'll be groups of people.

 Like for instance, what if--if we had a little 
girl here in the church, or a little boy, or 
somebody that we love real well, and
 life would go out of them. The whole 
church would get together, and they'd
 go to pray and fasting: ""Lord, have mercy 
on that child."" See? God could raise it up.

How many ever read the Nicene
 Fathers and them? You know, that's the 
way they did it in the early church.
 They'd all get together, you know, and 
even raise up their pastor sometime and
 different ones like that, if 
God seen fit to do it; but they did it.

that believeth on me, the works that I 
do shall he do also; and greater works
 than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father."

1627;My faith Has Found A Resting Place;G;"My faith has found a resting place 
Not in device or creed
I trust the ever living one 
His wounds for me shall plead

I need no other argument 
I need no other plea
It is enough that Jesus died 
And that He died for me

Enough for me that Jesus saves
This ends my fear and doubt 
A sinful soul I come to Him
He'll never cast me down

My heart is leaning on the Word
The living Word of God
Salvation by my Saviour's name
Salvation through His blood

My great Physician heals the sick
The lost He came to save
For me His precious blood He shed
For me His life He gave"

give you silver or gold
Or that you would never 
feel the fire or shiver in the cold
But I did say you'd never walk
through this world alone

And I did say, 
Don't make this world your home

I never said that fear 
wouldn't find you in the night
Or that loneliness was something
 you'd never have to fight
But I did say 
I'd be right there by your side
And I did say 
I'll always help you fight

'Cause you know 
I made a promise 
that I intend to keep
My grace will be sufficient 
in every time of need
my love will be the anchor 
that you can hold onto...
This is the promise, 
This is the promise I've made to you

I never said that friends 
would  never turn their backs on you
Or that the world around you
 wouldn't see you as a fool
But I did say like me you'll surely be despised
And I did say 
My ways confound the wise

I didn't say you'd never taste
the bitter kiss of death
Or have to walk through chilly Jordan
to enter into rest
But I did say 
I'd be waiting right on the other side
(Yeah, yeah)
And I did say I'll dry every tear you cry

'Cause you know
 I made a promise 
that I've prepared a place
And some day sooner than you think
 you'll see me face to face
And you'll sing with the angels
and a countless multitude...
This is the promise, 
This is the promise I've made to you

So just keep on walkin', 
don't turn to the left or right
And in the midst of darkness,
let this be your light
That hell can't separate us
and you're gonna make it through
This is the promise,
This is the promise I made to you"

Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten,
Throughout Heav'n's eternal days.

On the mount of crucifixion,
Fountains opened deep and wide,
Through the floodgates of God's Mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide.

Grace and Love, like mighty rivers,
Poured incessant from above,
And Heav'n's peace and justice
Kissed a guilty world in Love.

Let me all Thy Love accepting,
Love Thee, ever all my days;
Let me seek Thy kingdom only
And my life be to Thy praise;

Thou alone shalt be my glory,
Nothing in the world I see.
Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me,
Thou Thyself hast set me free.

In Thy Truth Thou dost direct me
By Thy Spirit through Thy Word;
And Thy Grace my need is meeting,
As I trust in Thee, my Lord.

Of Thy fullness Thou art pouring
Thy great Love and Power on me,
Without measure, full and boundless,
Drawing out my heart to Thee."

How can I ever say enough
How amazing is Your love
How can I keep from shouting Your name
I know I am loved by the King

Knowing You'll see me through

Preaching and singing on these dusty streets

On Friday my Lord was hung on a cross 
Its been three days now and I feel so empty
Its Sunday morning and I feel so lost

My name is Mary 
My heart is heavy
I've cried so much I cant cry anymore 
How could this happen? He was so gentle 
I've never met a man like Him before
How I adored him how I believed Him 
Such a sweet peace when he walked in the room 
I washed His feet oh but latley I cant sleep
Its Sunday morning, I think I'll visit His tomb

My name is Peter 
Maybe they told you 
I had denied Him I'm sorry its true 
He knew my weakness still He forgave me 
I stood up to the soldiers there were only a few
But I felt His hand come to rest on my shoulder 
He lowered my sword 
""Is this what I taught?""
Thats when they took him ; later they beat him 
Its Sunday morning; I wish now I'd fought

I am a SOLDIER 
I am a Roman 
I saw the wound in His side cut so deep 
I have been stationed all night at His graveside 
But its Sunday morning and I feel asleep
There in the darkness the earth shook and trembled 
The tomb was found empty the stone rolled away 
Mary left weeping on the path was a stranger 
In the first light of Sunday, she asked Him His name
She asked Him His name

M name is Jesus

He said "" My name is Jesus and I have returned 
from the grave in fullfillment of my Fathers Plan""

I marched into hell past the gates of that Kingdom

And I have returned with the keys in my hand

I am the Son of God 
I'm the redeemer 
i'm the great shepherd and I am the Lamb

But its Sunday morning and I am alive

Some think His miracles could be explained away
Some say that He was just a good man

Sceptics rise, speak their lies

Truth is marching on
Truth is marching on
Down the corridors of time
Invincible Divine
Until all that's false is finally gone
Truth is marching on

Faith has always had its noisy enemies
Then they rise up but only for a moment
Till we see the evidence through the centuries

How big and wide His vast Domain
To try to tell my lips could only start
He's big enough to rule the mighty universe
Yet He's small enough to live within my heart

Though man may strive to go beyond the realms of space
To fly beyond the distant shining star 
This world's a room so small within the Master's House
The universe is but a portion of His yard

Winter's chill will cause the tiny seed to fall
To lie asleep, then wake by Summer's rain
And the heart grown cold will warm and thrive with Life anew
Oh the Master's touch will bring new Life to you

Sold me to slavery

The forty ninth year was the longest year
Then I heard the trumpet sound

And then I heard the Jubilee
I walked free
I walked free
I walked free
When I heard the Jubilee
I walked free
And I ain't going back to slavery
Because Jesus has set me free

Years I spent in confusion
I had eyes but couldn't see
The enemy had me stumbling in darkness
Spiritual slavery
But then I heard the prophet's Message
I heard the Voice behind the voice
He opened up the workd and let the light shine in
Said you can all go free

There are so many hills to climb upward,
I often am longing for rest,
But He who appoints me my pathway,
Knows just what is needful and best.
I know in His word He hath promised
That my strength, it shall be as my day.
And the toils of the road will seem nothing,
When I get to the end of the way.
And the toils of the road will seem nothing,
When I get to the end of the way.

He loves me too well to forsake me
Or give me one trial too much,
All His people have been dearly purchased,
And Satan can never claim such.
By and by I shall see Him and praise Him,
In the city of unending day.
And the toils of the road will seem nothing,
When I get to the end of the way,
And the toils of the road will seem nothing,
When I get to the end of the way.

When the last feeble step has been taken,
And the gates of that city appear,
And the beautiful songs of the angels
Float out on my listening ear.
When all that now seems so mysterious
Will be bright and as clear as the day.
Then the toils of the road will seem nothing,
When I get to the end of the way,
Then the toils of the road will seem nothing,
When I get to the end of the way."

It's only found in one Place

Take me into the Holy of Holies
Take me in by the Blood of the Lamb
Take me into the Holy of Holies
Take the coal, Cleanse my lips, Here I am

In the Holy Place made clean

The Mighty Presence of Jehovah
And I a prisoner of love
Shut into a Secret Place
Beyond the Inner Veil"

So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;

Who ask me where they are,

They're underneath the Blood,
Of the Cross of Calvary,
As far removed as darkness 
is from dawn;

In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
That's good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me 
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I'm glad my sins are gone."

That city bright and fair
And we lift our first Hallelujah there

We will join the song of Endless Ages
Ringing through the blessed Promise Land
With the saints and angels and their praises
Singing, ""Holy Holy Holy is the Lamb!""

The songs of earth will all be faded
Their melodies never would compare

To walking through the gates
Seeing Jesus face to face
And lifting our first Hallelujah there

There may come a day
When these mortal bodies
Will near the grave
And know the pain of death

But even then, may we be singing
Songs of victory
With our final breath â¦

There's a---[---[Chorus:1]---:1]--- we'll declare

How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
And make a wretch His treasure

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

Behold the Man upon the Cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, nor wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom"

Had it not been
For the Old Rugged Cross

Although He prayed,

And I'm so glad 
He didn't call Heaven's angels
'From my hands pull these that torment Me!'"

Cries that says I want to know You

Warm my hungering to be whole.

And give the way He gave

Lord I'm giving my life away
Laying it down on the altar
Now I'm giving my life away

The very least I can offer 
Is my all.
So here I stand today
Giving my life away.

No earthly prize could be too great
No sacrifice too much to make

Disappear into the sea

Speak to the mountain
Speak with authority
And the mountain must move
And you shall claim victory

In the midst of the battle
When the foe is gaining ground
Just look up and see
The mighty hand of God reaching down

Speak God's name and satan trembles
Speak God's word and watch him flee
Once again our God delivers
The mountain crumbles at our feet

Speak to the mountain

Name above all names
Worthy of our praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God (Repeat All)"
1729;Lord I lift Your name (New);A;"Lord, my heart can grow so far away and cold
And yet for me Your love is still the same
Lord, I bend my knee in awe and fear of Thee
My head bowed down in reverence to Your Name

Lord I lift Your Name, Your Holy Name
Jehovah, God, Elohim
You’re The Great I am, The Risen Lamb
My Comforter, and King

Lord, my heart’s desire
Is to be filled with The Spirit’s Fire
My purpose is to worship You alone
Open up my soul, to worship and adore
To be a fragrance offered to Your throne"
1730;We Press On (New);Bb;"When the valley is deep, 
when the mountain is steep
When the body is weary, 
when we stumble and fall

When the choices are hard, 
when we're battered and scarred
When we've spent our resources, 
when we've given our all

In Jesus' name we press on
In Jesus' name, we press on
Dear Lord with the prize, 
clear before our eyes
We find the strength to press on

We have heard from our Lord, 
the call of Malachi 4
Our hearts are rejoicing, 
for what we have in store

We are lonesome for home, 
and the saints who've gone on
To be changed in a moment, 
and walk through heaven's door"
1731;Once And For All;;"An endless stream of pilgrims, 
Made their way into Jerusalem
To offer up the goat, 
the lamb and dove

Atonement for their sin was made, 
But only for a season
Their empty hearts still cried out, 
For a lasting peace and love

Then from Bethlehem He came 
Emmanuel was His name
He knew the world, would need a sacrifice
And a million lambs could never pay the price

Once and for all, He walked the road to Calvary
Carrying the sins, of every man upon His shoulders
Once and for all, he conquered death victoriously
Tearing down, the separating wall
And the price was paid in full
Once and for all

An endless stream of mercy, 
Falls like rain from Heaven's Holy throne
To everyone who calls, upon His name

Though we all were sinners, 
He loved beyond our weaknesses
And though we were unworthy, 
He came to suffer in our place

And as His blood fell to the ground, 
Our hope again was found
No longer are we guilty and oppressed
For He has thrown our sins, 
As far as east is from the west"
1732;My Theophany is calling me;;"One day I'm gonna take a step
towards my Theophany,
One day I'm gonna take another step,
into my Theophany,

one day I know the final step
is going to set me free;
my Theophany I hear it calling me.

It's calling come up, a little higher,
into the perfect world,
come up, a little higher,
into the agape love,

come up, a little higher,
soaring through the heavenly,
my Theophany I hear it calling me.

Don't you worry little children,
should death knock on your door,
don't you know that is a doorway
that leads to the heavenly shore,
for there is no heartache,
no sorrow, grief nor pain,
just perfect love, peace 
and joy beyond compare.

Over the next hill, I look,
I see victory, around the next turn
in the road, that devil has got to flee,
God's army is marching, 
marching onward to slay that old enemy,
around the next turn,
I see King Jesus, King Jesus coming for me."
1733;Eliezer Telll Me More;;"Eliezer was sent
to get a bride for Isaac,
found Rebekah in a
foreign distant land
She believed 
every word he told her, 

she left home following a man
To a place she'd never been before, 
to marry a man she'd never seen
She loved to hear him tell about Isaac
following this camel train

Eliezer tell me more,
what's Isaac really look like
I've never seen him 
yet I'm to be his bride

You say he has a home for me,
I can't wait to walk through the door
Oh I want to see him, 
Eliezer tell me more

On this journey to meet Isaac,
Rebekah said I'm thirty and it's hot
Eliezer said don't weary here's 
some ever present water from the rock

She said I'm hungry,
did you bring something to eat?
Here's some spiritual food
in due season for you,
I've brought everything you need

Eliezer have you seen Him?
What's He really like
Yes I've seen Him, 
in a sage field late one night

His garment blowing in the wind,
then I spoke His name
I said Jesus,
He turned and looked at me, 
and I've never been the same"
1734;This Ain't the Time;;"This ain't the time 
to get discouraged 
This ain't the time to 
turn n run

You can't fight 
with your back to the devil 
Can't defend yourself 
carrying an unloaded gun

This ain't the time to 
stop praying 
This ain't the time 
to lay down the word

For this war that we're fighting
takes a strong hand of faith, 
a two edged sword

This ain't the time 
to get discouraged 
This ain't the time 
to turn n run

You can't fight 
with your back to the devil 
Can't defend yourself 
carrying an unloaded gun

This ain't the time 
to fight your brother
Bride don't persecute Bride

Let's get out of that backyard
Stand together, hand in hand, 
We'll overcome 

This ain't the time 
to get discouraged
This ain't the time
to turn n run 
You can't fight 
with your back to the devil 

Can't defend yourself 
carrying an unloaded gun
Can't defend yourself
 carrying an unloaded gun"
1735;In Death There is Victory;B;"Up the hill with the load, 
Jesus walked up Calvary's road.
No man took His life from Him,
For you and me He willingly gave.

In His mind, He held a vision, 
It was of the resurrection, 
Truly He paid death's price;
Our victory's complete In the perfect sacrifice.

In death, in death, 
In death, there's victory. 
Self sacrifice means freedom, 
And this is the way for me.

For the joy set before, 
There's a cross to endure. 
For real life, this I see,
 That in death there's victory.

Abraham held the promise, 
'In Isaac shall thy seed be called.'
He died to his own thinking, 
When God told him sacrifice his boy.

Obedient unto death he was faithful, 
Knowing resurrection was in the end.
This he said: 
""The lad and I, we'll go worship 
And come to you again.""

In death, in death, 
In death, there's victory. 
Self sacrifice means freedom, 
And this is the way for me.

By faith Jocebed placed Moses 
In the mouth of death on the river Nile, 
Pharaoh's daughter, finding him, 
To the house of death she took the child, 
There he lived with those who’d sought his life

And to the desert he had to flee, 
Where he died to his own thinking, 
To lead Israel to their victory.

In death, in death, 
In death, there's victory. 
Self sacrifice means freedom, 
And this is the way for me.

Samson prayed, “let me die” 
his victory that day 
was more than in all his life
If I perish, I perish but the King, 
the king I’ll see 
I must go and set my people free; 

The three Hebrew boys walked in this flame 
they did not bow down and God delivered them; 
To death's decree Daniel did not give in 
victory was on his knees He came alive from the den

In death, in death, 
In death, there's victory. 
Self sacrifice means freedom, 
And this is the way for me. 
For the joy set before, 
There's a cross to endure. 
For real life, this I see, 
That in death there's victory.

Tell me now, Bride of Christ, 
We're not different, we must pay the price
As we lift up our cross, 
Though we suffer and our lives are lost;

Yet we must die to ourselves and sin, 
Truly become a burnt-offering, 
But it's sure in the end, 
That we’ll rise, we’ll rise again

In death, in death, 
In death, there's victory. 
Self sacrifice means freedom, 
And this is the way for me. 
For the joy set before,
 There's a cross to endure. 

For real life, this I see,
 That in death there's victory.
For the joy set before, 
There's a cross to endure. 
For real life, this I see, 
That in death there's victory"
1736;Blessed be the Name of the Lord;F;"Blessed be the Name of the Lord
He is worthy to be praised and adored
So we lift up holy hands in one accord
Singing blessed be the Name

1737;You are worthy of my praise;F;"I will worship, with all of my heart
I will praise You, with all of my strength

You alone I long to worship
You alone are worthy of my praise

I will bow down, hail You as King
I will serve You, give You everything
I will lift up, my eyes to Your throne
And I will trust You, I will trust You alone"
1738;Grateful;;"A pilgrim sojourning a land that's not my own
Seeking to quench the thirst within
And then a miracle of light on the horizon
Shining on the road to higher ground

I am grateful that He sent the Truth my way
Just so grateful for the change that it has made
When I think of where I could have been
And where He brought me from
Makes me grateful that He sent the Truth my way

The Word keeps growing and unfolding everyday
He leads and guides along the way
Didn't our hearts burn as He spoke along the way?
Break the bread Lord, this is what we pray

I am grateful that He sent the Truth my way
Just so grateful for the change that it has made
When I think of where I could have been
And what He kept me from
Makes me grateful that He sent the Truth my way"
1739;Magnify the Lord with me (Psalm 34);Psalm 34;"I sought the Lord
And He answered me
And delivered me
From every fear

Those who look on Him
Are radiant
They'll never be ashamed
They'll never be ashamed

This poor man cried
And the Lord heard me
And saved me from
My enemies

The Son of God
Surrounds His saints
He will deliver them
He will deliver them

Magnify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name together
Glorify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name forever

Oh taste and see
That the Lord is good
Oh blessed is he
Who hides in Him

Oh fear the Lord
Oh all you saints
He'll give you everything
He'll give you everything

Magnify the Lord with me

Every day and night
Never ending praise
May our incense rise (x4)

Magnify the Lord with me

Glorify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name forever (x2)

Oh taste and see
That the Lord is good
He'll give you everything
He'll give you everything"
1740;Giving My Life Away;;"I've seen a vision harsh and sweet
Of One who gave all He had for me
I've seen the passion of His death
And the forgiveness of His final breath

And now I can never be the same
for my life has been forever changed
I want to live and love
And give the way He gave

Lord I'm giving my life away
Laying it down on the altar
Now I'm giving my life away

The very least I can offer 
Is my all.
So here I stand today
Giving my life away.

No earthly prize could be too great
No sacrifice too much to make
No way of measuring the cost
Next to the Blood of Calvary's cross

So if I live, I live for Him
Or if I die, I count it gain.
My life is not my own,
But His from this day on"
1741;Right Where I Belong;who am I anyway;"Who am I anyway
 I'm just a little lump of clay

It doesn't mean that i have failed

For when I'm weak, Lord, You are strong

Right where I belong

Like a flower that blooms and fades away 
It's mortal life withers every day

Right where I belong

Right where I belong

For You died to set me free
And You did it so willingly
To bring me to that place
Right where I belong

1742;When I'm tossed on life's sea;One More Valley;"When I'm tossed on life's sea
And the waves cover me,
And the dark clouds won't let
The sunshine through

The the voice seems to say, 
""Child, there'll be brighter day, 
Don't allow the storm to hide 
Sweet Heavens view""

Cause you got, one more valley 
One more hill
Maybe one more trial one more tear, 
One more curve in life's road, 
Maybe one more mile to go, You can lay down your 
Heavy load when we go home

Don't let Satan see your tears
Learn to smile through your fears.
Hold your head up high and give the world 
a smile. You must be faithful all the way
Twill be worth it someday
For its all gonna be over after a while"

1744;Angels Step Aside;;"What a celebration on that day.
You know it can't be far away.
Heaven's Bridegroom has descended,

The ransomed Bride of God ascends;
Heaven's bell will sweetly ring,
Choir of angels start to sing,
Pick up that trumpet, Gabriel, and blow.

Here comes the Bride to be ever at His side
Oh, what a spotless Bride!
Oh, what a glorious sight!
Here comes the chosen ones,

Here comes the ransomed ones,
Angels step aside for here comes the Bride
Angels step aside for here comes the Bride
Oh happy day,
what a happy day!

Some from every nation will be there,
Wearing spotless robes so bright and fair.
All of heaven will behold,
The Bride is marching down the streets of gold,

Getting ready now to go,
The very hour no one seems to know,
Pick up that trumpet, Gabriel, and blow.

Bro. Branham saw them in preview
But here we are now in view
All of heaven will behold
The Bride is marching down the streets of gold

Getting ready now to go
The very hour no one seems to know
Pick up that trumpet, Gabriel, and blow."
1745;We are The Generation (Youth);;"We're living in the evening time
The race is almost through
God has chosen you and me
There's still a job to do


The Word that's been revealed to us
Must be prophesied again
And the Message must reach everywhere
Till that last soul has come in

We are the Generation We're the culmination
The final voice the world will hear
The coming of the Lord is near


Living out the revelation, overcoming sin's temptation
the Truth will go to every tongue and nation
We are the chosen generation

Committed to the calling
Together we stand strong
Lifting up our voice as one
We'll sing the final song


God has chosen us to conquer every test we face
He has seen us through this far
And we'll finish by His Grace

We are the Generation We're the culmination
The final voice the world will hear
The coming of the Lord is near


Living out the revelation, overcoming sin's temptation
the Truth will go to every tongue and nation
We are the chosen generation (X2)"
1746;Supernatural;;"Moses led the people of Israel
A vindicated Prophet all could tell
A Pillar of Fire by night and a Cloud by day
Leading all God’s children in a
Supernatural Way

Now I have seen my Moses of my day
Vindicated in a Supernatural Way
The Word has been restored
I’m preparing to meet my Lord
The Message of the hour is
Overcoming Power

We've seen the Supernatural in our day
God Himself has come our way
We follow a Pillar of Fire
And a Cloud that takes us higher
The Word of God is alive in our day"
1747;Rising Up;;"As I look out across the land
I see God's mighty Hand.
The Bride of Christ adorn in her wedding gown
Just like in the days of old, they stood in courage bow
They turn this whole world upside down

Rising Up! Rising Up!
There's a New Testament Church rising up!

Now the Bible plainly tells
How the Holy Ghost fell
Sign and wonders were done by the apostle's hands
Demon spirits were cast down in jail they sang and shout
Surrounded by God's Holy Angels bands

Well if you think it all gone
And the miracles are all done
I've got some good news to bring to you
In the last day He'll pour His Spirit more and more
Like a Mighty Eagle your strength He'll renew!"

Around the throne he saw the crystal sea
There's got to be more, what will it be
I want to go, to that city he saw
New Jerusalem



Jerusalem
I want to walk your streets that are golden
And I want to walk where the angels have trod
Jerusalem
I want to rest on the banks of your river
In that city, the city of God

John saw the lion lay down by the lamb
I want to know everything about that land
John saw the day but he did not see night
The lamb of God well, he must be the light

And he saw the saints worship the great I am
Crying worthy, worthy is the lamb
I want to go to that city he saw
New Jerusalem

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Sing for the night is o'er
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna forever
Forever more

The city of God
Jerusalem, Jerusalem
The city of God, It's the city of God"
