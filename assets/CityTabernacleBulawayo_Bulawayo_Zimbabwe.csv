And oh the sights I saw
But I said I want to see Jesus
The One who died for all

Chorus
Then I bowed on my knees 
and cried ""Holy, Holy, Holy"";
I clapped my hands and sang ""Glory,
Glory to the Son of God!""

I thought when I entered that City
My friends knew me well
They showed me all through heaven
The scenes are too numerous to tell
they showed me Abraham, Isaac, Jacob
Mark, Luke and Timothy
But I said I want to give praise
To the One who died for me

I thought when I saw my Saviour
Oh! Glory to God!
I just fell right down before Him
Singing ""Praise to the name of the Lord""
I bowed down and worshiped Jehovah
My friend of Calvary
For I wanted to give praise to Jesus
For saving, a sinner like me."

Fear not, little flock, 
He goeth ahead,
Your shepherd selecteth 
The path you must tread;
The waters of Marah 
He'll sweeten for thee,
He drank all the bitter 
     in Gethsemane.

Fear not, little flock, 
What ever your lot,
He enters all rooms,
""The doors being shut;""
He never forsakes, 
He never is gone,
So count on His presence 
In darkness and dawn.

Trusting, confiding in 
His great love;
From all harm safe 
In His sheltering arm.
I'm living by faith 
And I feel no alarm.

Though tempest may blow 
And the stormclouds arise,
Obscuring the brightness of life,
I'm never alarmed 
At the overcast skies,
The Master looks on at the strife.

I know that He safely 
     will carry me through,
No matter what evils betide,
Why should I then care, 
Though the tempest may blow,
If Jesus walks close to my side.

Our Lord will return to this

Our troubles will then all be o'er.
The Master so gently 
Will lead us away,
Beyond that blest heavenly shore."

Shall renew their strength,
They shall mount up with wings 
     as eagles,
They shall run and not be weary, 
They shall walk and not faint;

Teach me, Lord, to wait.

Teach me, Lord, to wait 
While hearts are aflame,

And cleanse within;

Threaten the soul 
With infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, 
Yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge, 
The Mighty Cross.

That we cannot hide,
What can avail 
To wash it away?
Look! there is flowing 
A crimson tide;
Whiter than snow 
You may be today.

Freely bestowed 
On all who believe!

Are gathering in,
Washed like snow, 
And free from all sin;
How we'll shout, 
And how we'll sing,
When the redeemed 
Are gathering in.

There will be a great procession 
Over on the streets of gold,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Oh what music, Oh what singing, 
O'er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption's story 
With their voices clear and strong,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Then the angels all will listen, 
For they cannot join that song,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Then the Saviour will give orders 
To prepare the banquet board,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
And we'll hear His invitation, 
""Come, ye blessed of the Lord,""
When the redeemed are gathering in."

Oh how I love Jesus,
Oh how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.

It tells me of a Savior's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood;
The sinner's perfect plea.

It tells me what 
 my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread 
 a darksome path,
Yields sunshine 
 all the way.

It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part,
That none can bear below.

To me, You are so wonderful,
To me, You are so wonderful,

     my Saviour and Guide,
Let me never in darkness rove;
Keep my path free from wrath, 
    and my soul satisfied,
Fill my way every day with love.

Soon the race will be o'er, and 
     I'll travel no more,
But abide in my home above;
Let me sing, blessed King, 
     all the way to the shore,
Fill my way every day with love."
212;I Love Him;C;"Gone from my heart the world
     and all its charms;
Now, through the blood, 
     I'm saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart 
     is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus 
     cleanses white as snow.

CHORUS
I love Him, I love Him
Because He first loved me
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary's tree.

Once I was lost, and 'way 
     down deep in sin,
Once was a slave to passions 
     fierce within;
Once was afraid to 
     trust a loving God;
But now I'm cleansed from every 
     stain through Jesus' blood.

Once I was bound, 
     but now I am set free;
Once, I was blind, but now 
     the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now 
     in Christ I live,
To tell the world around 
     the peace that He doth give."

CHORUS
Some day beyond the reach 
     of mortal ken,
Some day, God only knows 
Just where and when,
The wheels of mortal life 
Shall all stand still,
And I shall go to dwell 
     on Zion's hill.

Some day I'll hear the 
     angels singing,
Beyond the shadows 
     of the tomb;
And all the bells of 
     heaven ringing,
While saints are singing, 
""Home, Sweet Home.""

Some day my labors will 
     be ended,
And all my wand'rings 
     will be o'er,
And all earth's broken ties 
     be mended,
And I shall sigh and weep 
     no more.

Some day the dark clouds 
     will be rifted,
And all the night of gloom 
     be past;
And all life's burdens 
     will be lifted,
The day of rest shall 
     dawn at last."

That heavenly mansion 
     shall be mine,
I feel like traveling on.

Let others seek a home below,
I feel like traveling on;
Which flames devour, 
Or waves o'er flow,
I feel like traveling on.

The Lord has been so 
     good to me,
I feel like traveling on;
Until that blessed home I see,
I feel like traveling on."
216;I Am Marked;Ab;"I have lost my reputation 
Since I turned my back on sin,
And a lot of friends went from me 
Since I let my Saviour in;
Now they pass me by unknown, 
When they once passed with a smile;
Now they say I'm very foolish, 
And they say I'm out of style.

CHORUS
I am marked, marked, marked,
I am marked, now wherever I go;
I am marked, marked, marked,
Just what I am everyone seems to know.
I am sealed, sealed, sealed,
I am sealed by His Spirit Divine;
Oh glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen!
I am His and I know that He is mine.

Well, they say my life is ruined, 
And my talent thrown away,
And they cannot understand it, 
For I had such plans one day;
But I know what I surrendered 
When I promised I'd go through;
And I gained far more glory 
Since God made me over new."

Came to earth one day;
He was born in a stable,
In a manger of hay;
Though here rejected,
But not from above,
God gave us His sign,
On the wings of a dove.

Though I have suffered
In many a way,
I cried for healing
Both night and day;
Faith wasn't forgotten
By the Father above,
He gave me His sign

The bride in her anguish
Is awaiting the claim
Of her Loved One and Saviour
Who is Jesus by Name
Though here rejected
But not from above
God gave her His sign
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a dove."
218;Beyond The Sunset;Db;"Beyond the sunset, 
Oh blissful morning,
When with our Saviour 
Heaven is begun.
Earth's toiling ended, 
Oh glorious dawning;
Beyond the sunset, 
when day is done.

Beyond the sunset 
No clouds will gather,
No storms will threaten, 
No fears annoy.
Oh day of gladness, 
Oh day unending;
Beyond the sunset, eternal joy.

Beyond the sunset, 
A hand will guide me
To God, the Father, 
Whom I adore;
His glorious presence, 
His words of welcome,
Will be my portion 
On that fair shore.

Beyond the sunset, 
Oh glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones 
Who've gone before.
In that fair homeland 
We'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset forevermore."
219;Shall We Gather At The River;C;"Shall we gather at the river, 
Where bright angel feet have trod,
With its crystal tide forever,
Flowing from the throne of God.

CHORUS
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river;
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows from the throne of God.

On the bosom of the river,
Where the Saviour-King we own,
We shall meet and sorrow never,
'Neath the glory of the throne.

On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy, golden day.

Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

At the smiling of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour's face,
Saints whom death will never sever
Lift their songs of saving grace.

Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace."
220;Must Jesus Bear Alone?;G;"Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for every one,
And there's a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I'll bear,
Till death shall set me free,
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there's a crown for me.

Upon the crystal pavement, down
At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,.
And His dear name repeat.

Oh precious cross! Oh glorious crown!
Oh resurrection day!
Ye angels from the stars come down
And bear my soul away."
221;Won't It Be Wonderful?;F;"When with the Saviour 
we enter the gloryland,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Ended the troubles 
and cares of the storyland,
Won't it be wonderful there?

CHORUS
Won't it be wonderful there?
Having no burdens to bear?
Joyously singing 
With heart-bells all ringing,
Oh won't it be wonderful there?

Walking and talking with Christ, 
     the supernal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Praising adoring the matchless 
     eternal One,
Won't it be wonderful there?

There where the tempest 
Will never be sweeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?
Sure that forever the Lord 
     will be  keeping us,
Won't it be wonderful there?"
222;When I Reach That City;F;"On the top of Mount Zion is a city
And the earth with glory it doth fill;
I shall look on its beauty in the 
     morning
When I reach that city on the hill.

CHORUS
Oh, that city on Mount Zion,
Tho' a pilgrim, yet I love thee still;
I'll not leave thee, through the ages,
When I reach that city on the hill.

I'm invited to come home to that city,
For the Word says, ""Whosoever will,""
And I'll find there a mansion for me
     waiting
When I reach that city on the hill.

Death will never molest me in that city,
Never leave me lying cold and chill;
And I'll enter to live up there forever
When I reach that city on the hill.

So I'll stay here until my Saviour 
     calls me,
Trying daily to perform His will;
Then He'll say unto me, ""Well done,""
     up yonder
When I reach that city on the hill."
223;I Am Resolved;Ab;"I am resolved no longer 
   to linger,
Charmed by the world's
     delight;
Things that are higher, 
     things that are nobler,
These have allured my sight.

CHORUS
I will hasten to Him,
Hasten so glad and free,
Jesus, greatest, highest,
I will come to Thee.

I am resolved to go to the 
    Saviour, 
Leaving my sin and strife;
He is the true One, He is
     the just One,
He hath the words of life.

I am resolved to follow    
     the Saviour,
Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He sayeth, 
     do what He willeth,
He is the living way.

I am resolved to enter 
    the kingdom,
Leaving the paths of sin;
Friends may oppose me, 
     foes may beset me
Still will I enter in.

I am resolved, and who will 
     go with me?
Come, friends, without delay,
Taught by the Bible, led by 
     the Spirit,
We'll walk the heavenly way."
224;Jesus Is The One;F;"Jesus is the one, 
Yes He's the only one,
Let Him have His way 
Until the day is done;
When He speaks, you know 
The clouds will have to go,
Just because He loves you so."
225;Open My Eyes, That I May See;Bb;"Open my eyes, 
That I may see
Glimpses of truth 
Thou hast for me;
Place in my hands 
The wonderful key
That shall unclasp, 
And set me free.

CHORUS
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit Divine!

Open my ears, 
That I may hear
Voices of truth 
Thou sendest clear;
And while the wave-notes 
Fall on my ear,
Everything false 
Will disappear,

Open my mouth, 
And let me bear
Gladly the warm 
Truth everywhere;
Open my heart, 
And let me prepare,
Love with Thy children 
Thus to share."
226;The Love Of God;C;"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

CHORUS
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints and angels song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God's love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race,
The saints and angels' song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."
227;The Meeting In The Air;Bb;"You have heard of little Moses in the bulrush,
You have heard of fearless David and his sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming 
     Joseph,
And of Jonah and the whale you often sing.
There are many, many others through the Bible,
I should like to meet them all, I do declare!
By and by the Lord will surely let us meet them,
At the meeting in the air.

CHORUS
There is going to be a meeting in the air.
In the sweet, sweet by and by;
I am going to meet you, meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky;
Such singing you will hear, 
Never heard by mortal ear,
'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son will be the leading One
At the meeting in the air.

Many things will there be missing 
In that meeting:
For the mourners bench 
Will have no place at all;
There will never be a sermon 
Preached to sinners,
For the sinner had refused to heed the call.
There will be no mourning 
Over wayward loved ones,
There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer;
All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted
At that meeting in the air.

There the doubters will be missing altogether,
All the skeptics will be absent on that day;
There will be no grumblers present to disturb us,
And the Achans will be busy far away.
There the saints will have His 
     ""seal upon their foreheads,""
Dressed in raiment none 
But ransomed ones can wear;
All who have the wedding garments 
     will be present, 
At the meeting in the air."
228;The Old Time Religion;G;"It's the old-time Holy Spirit,
And the devil won't go near It,
That's the reason people fear It;
But it's good enough for me.

CHORUS
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
Give me that old-time religion,
It's good enough for me.

It will make you stop your lying;
It will save you when you're dying;
It will start the devil flying;
And It's good enough for me.

It's so good I want no other,
For It makes me love my brother;
And It brings things from under 
     cover,
And It's good enough for me.

(It was good in the fiery furnace...)
(It was good for Paul and Silas...)
(It was good for our fathers...)
(It was good for Brother Branham...)
(Makes me love everybody...)
(It will takes us all to Heaven...)"
229;Jesus, The Light;Eb;"All ye saints of light proclaim,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Life and mercy in His name,
Jesus, the light of the world.

CHORUS
We'll walk in the light, 
    the beautiful light,
Come where the dewdrops 
    of mercy are bright;
Shine all around us 
    by day and by night,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Hear the Saviour's earnest call,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Send the Gospel truth to all,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Why not seek Him then today,
Jesus, the light of the world;
Go with truth the narrow way,
Jesus, the light of the world.

Come, confess Him as your King, 
Jesus, the light of the world;
Then the bells of heaven will ring,
Jesus, the light of the world."
230;It's Dripping With Blood;Eb;"The first one to die for 
This Holy Ghost plan,
Was John the Baptist, 
But he died like a man;
Then came the Lord Jesus, 
They crucified Him,
He taught that the Spirit 
Would save men from sin.

CHORUS
It's dripping with blood, Yes, 
It's dripping with blood,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood,
The blood of disciples 
Who died for the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel 
Is dripping with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, 
And John the divine,
They gave up their lives so 
This Gospel could shine;
They mingled their blood, 
Like the prophets of old,
So the true Word of God 
Could honest be told.

Then they stoned Stephen, 
He preached against sin,
He made them so angry, 
They dashed his head in;
But he died in the Spirit, 
And gave up the ghost,
And went to join others, 
In that life-giving host.

There's souls under the altar, 
Crying, ""How long?""
For the Lord to punish 
Those who've done wrong;
But there's going to be more 
Who'll give their life's blood
For this Holy Ghost Gospel 
And its crimson flood."
231;Have Thine Own Way, Lord;Eb;"Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Thou are the Potter;
I am the clay.
Mould me and make me
After Thy will,
While I am waiting, 
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me,
Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in thy presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray!
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o'er my being
Absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me."
232;The Homecoming Week;F;"Upon our journey here below 
     we meet with pain and loss;
Sometimes there is a crown of thorns,
     sometimes the heavy cross.
The dreary road to Calvary,
     the bitter goad and sting,
But what's inside those gates of pearl
     will be worth everything.

CHORUS
When we're inside the gates of pearl,
We'll learn a lot of things,
We'll have a harp that's made of gold,
Perhaps a thousand strings;
We'll sing and shout and dance about,
The Lamb will dry our tears;
We'll have a grand homecoming week,
The first ten thousand years.

The shadows now begin to fall,
     the time is drawing nigh,
When Christ our Lord shall come again
     like lightning from the sky.
And while we wait and suffer here, 
     praise God, we'll shout and sing,
For one glimpse through those gates
     of pearl will be worth everything.

The precious blood of God's own Son
     has saved and sanctified
A wondrous people for His name 
     and they are called the Bride.
Though here neglected and despised,
     one day the Lord will bring
His chosen ones within the gates,
     and that's worth everything."
233;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot;F;"I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home;
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

CHORUS
Swing low, sweet chariot, 
Coming for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

If you get there before I do,
Coming for to carry me home;
Tell all my friends I'm coming too,
Coming for to carry me home."
234;Peace In The Valley;C;"Well, I'm tired and so weary, 
But I must go along;
Till the Lord comes and calls 
Me away, oh, yes;
Well the morning is bright 
And the Lamb is the Light;
And the night, night is as fair 
As the day, oh yes.

CHORUS
There will be peace in the valley 
For me some day;
There will be peace in the valley 
For me, oh, Lord, I pray;
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow,
     no trouble I'll see;
There will be peace 
In the valley for me.

There the flow'rs will be blooming, 
And the grass will be blue;
And the skies will be clear 
And serene, oh, yes;
Well the sun ever beams, 
In this valley of dreams;
And no clouds there will ever 
Be seen,oh, yes.

Well, the bear will be gentle, 
And the wolf will be tame;
And the lion shall lay down 
By the lamb, oh, yes;
Well the beast from the wild, 
Shall be led by a little child;
And I'll be changed, changed 
From this creature that I am, oh, yes."
235;Wonderful;F;"Oh my heart sings today, 
Sings for joy and gladness,
Jesus saves, satisfies, 
Banishes my sadness;
Guilt is gone, peace is mine, 
Peace like to a river,
Jesus is wonderful, 
Mighty to deliver.

CHORUS
Wonderful, wonderful, 
Jesus is to me,
Counselor, Prince of Peace, 
Mighty God is He;
Saving me, keeping me 
From all sin and shame,
Wonderful is my Redeemer, 
Praise His name!

Once a slave, now I'm free, 
Free from condemnation,
Jesus gives liberty 
And a full salvation;
Now the sins of the past 
Have been all forgiven,
And my name is inscribed 
On the book of heaven.

Living here with my Lord 
In a holy union,
Day by day, all the way 
Holding sweet communion;
Oh what change grace hath wrought 
In my lowly station!
Since my soul has received 
Full and free salvation."
236;I'll Be Listening;F;"When the Saviour calls I will answer,
When He calls for me I will hear;
When the Saviour calls I will answer,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

CHORUS
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name;
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

If my heart is right when He calls me,
If my heart is right I will hear;
If my heart is right when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

If my robe is white when He calls me,
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name."
237;Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus;F;"O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free!

CHORUS
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion,
For more than conqu'rors we are!

His Word shall not fail you, 
     He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well;
Then go to a world that is dying, 
His perfect salvation to tell!"
238;A Child Of The King;Eb;"My Father is rich in 
     houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of 
      the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, 
      of silver and gold
His coffers are full, 
     He has riches untold.

CHORUS
I'm a child of the King!
A child of the King!
With Jesus my Saviour,
I'm a child of the King!

My Father's own Son, 
      the Saviour of men,
Once wandered o'er earth 
     as the poorest of  them;
But now He is reigning 
     forever on high,
And will give me a home 
     in heav'n by and by.

I once was an outcast, 
     stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, 
     and an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted, 
     my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, 
     a robe, and a crown.

A tent or a cottage, 
     why should I care?
They're building a palace 
     for me over there!
Though exiled from home, 
     yet still I may sing:
All glory to God, 
     I'm a child of the King!"
239;Battle Hymn Of The Republic;Ab;"Mine eyes have seen the glory
     of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
     of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
     of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
     in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
     by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
     that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
     before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
     be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
     Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
     that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
     let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on."
240;The Unveiled Christ;C;"Once Our blessed Christ of beauty, 
Was veiled off from human view;
But through suff'ring, 
     death and sorrow,
He has rent the veil in two.

CHORUS
Oh behold the man of sorrows,
Oh behold Him in plain view,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two,
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Yes, He is with God, the Father,
Interceding there for you;
For He is the mighty conqueror,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due,
For He is the well beloved,
Since He rent the veil in two.

Throughout time and endless ages,
Heights and depths of love so true,
He alone can be the giver,
Since He rent the veil in two."
241;Hold To God's Hand;F;"Time is filled with swift transition,
Naught of earth unmoved can stand,
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging hand!

CHORUS
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
Hold to God's unchanging hand!
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging hand!

Trust in Him who will not leave you,
Whatsoever years may bring,
If by earthly friends forsaken,
Still more closely to Him cling!

Covet not this world's vain riches,
That so rapidly decay,
Seek to gain the heavenly treasures,
They will never pass away!

When your journey is completed,
If to God you have been true,
Fair and bright the home in glory,
Your enraptured soul will view!"
242;One Day;C;"One day when heaven 
Was filled with His praises,
One day when sin 
Was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth 
To be born of a virgin -
Dwelt amongst men, 
My example is He!

CHORUS
Living, He loved me; 
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried 
My sins far away;
Rising, He justified 
Freely forever:
One day He's coming - 
Oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him 
Up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him 
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, 
Despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins, 
My Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him 
Alone in the garden,
One day He rested, 
From suffering free;
Angels came down 
O'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, 
My Saviour is He!

One day the grave could 
Conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled 
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death 
He had conquered;
Now is ascended, 
My Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will 
Sound for His coming,
One day the skies with 
His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, 
My beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour, 
This Jesus is mine!"
243;The Lifeboat;F;"We're floating down the stream of time,
We have not long to stay;
The stormy clouds of darkness
Will turn to brightest day.
Then let us all take courage,
For we're not left alone;
The lifeboat soon is coming
To gather the Jewels home.

Chorus
Then cheer, my brother, cheer,
Our trial will soon be o'er,
Our loved ones we shall meet, shall meet,
Upon the golden shore.
We're pilgrims and we're strangers here,
We're seeking a city to come,
The lifeboat soon is coming,
To gather the Jewels home.

Sometimes the Devil tempts me,
And says it's all in vain
To try to live a Christian life
And walk in Jesus' name;
But then we hear the Master say,
""I'll lend you a helping hand,
And if you'll only trust Me,
I'll guide you to the land.""

The lifeboat soon is coming,
By eyes of faith I see
As she sweeps through the waters
To rescue you and me,
And land us safely in the port
With friends we love so dear.
""Get ready,"" cries the Captain;
""Oh, look, she's almost here.""

Oh, now's the time to get on board,
While she is passing by;
But if you stand and wait too long, 
You shall forever die;
The fare is paid for one and all,
The Captain bids you come,
And get on board the lifeboat,
She'll carry you safely home."
244;Down From His Glory;Eb;"Down from His glory, 
Ever living story,
My God and Saviour came, 
And Jesus was His Name.
Born in a manger, 
To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, 
Tears and agony.

CHORUS
Oh how I love Him!  
How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, 
My all in all!
The great Creator 
Became my Saviour,
And all God's fullness 
Dwelleth in Him.

What condescension, 
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night, 
Not one faint hope in sight;
God, gracious, tender, 
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, 
To save my soul.

Without reluctance, 
Flesh and blood His substance,
He took the form of man, 
Revealed the hidden plan.
Oh glorious mystery, 
Sacrifice of Calvary,
And now I know 
Thou art  the great ""I Am."""
246;How Great Thou Art;Ab;"Oh Lord my God!  
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds 
Thy hands have made;
I see the stars, 
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy pow'r throughout 
The universe displayed.

CHORUS
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great
    Thou art!"
247;Leave It There;F;"If the world from you withholds 
Of its silver and its gold,
And you have to get along 
With meager fare,
Just remember, in His Word, 
How He feeds the little bird;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

CHORUS
Leave it there, leave it there,
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there;
If you trust and never doubt,
He will surely bring you out;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

If your body suffers pain 
And your health you can't regain,
And your soul is 
Almost sinking in despair,
Jesus knows the pain you feel,
He can save and He can heal;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your enemies assail
And your heart begins to fail,
Don't forget that God 
In heaven answers prayer;
He will make a way for you 
And will lead you safely through;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there.

When your youthful days are gone
And old age is stealing on,
And your body bends 
Beneath the weight of care;
He will never leave you then,
He'll go with you to the end;
Take your burden to the Lord 
And leave it there."
248;What A Day That Will Be;F;"There is coming a day 
When no heartaches shall come,
No more clouds in the sky, 
No more tears to dim the eye;
All is peace forevermore 
On that happy golden shore,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

CHORUS
What a day that will be
When my Jesus I shall see,
When I look upon His face, 
The One who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand,
And leads me through 
The Promised Land,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be.

There'll be no sorrow there, 
No more burdens to bear,
No more sickness, no pain, 
No more parting over there;
And forever I will be 
With the One who died for me,
What a day, glorious day 
That will be."
249;Nothing Between;F;"Nothing between my soul and the Saviour,
Naught of this world's delusive dream:
I have renounced all sinful pleasure,
Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.

CHORUS
Nothing between my soul and the Saviour,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favour,
Keep the way clear!  Let nothing between.

Nothing between like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him ever sever;
He is my all, there's nothing between.

Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self or friends shall not intervene;
Though it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved, there's nothing between.

Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,
Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
I'll triumph at last, with nothing between."
250;In Times Like These;F;"In times like these you need a Saviour,
In times like these you need an anchor
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

CHORUS
This rock is Jesus, Yes, He's the One,
This rock is Jesus, the only One;
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these you need the Bible,
In times like these oh be not idle,
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock.

In times like these, I have a Saviour,
In times like these, I have an anchor,
I'm very sure, I'm very sure,
My anchor holds and grips 
     the solid rock."
251;He Abides;F;"I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the pilgrim way,
For the hand of God 
 in all my life I see,
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter 
  abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, He abides,
 Hallelujah, 
He abides with me
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter 
  abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus 
  died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care
I'm as happy as a bird 
 and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter 
 abides with me!

There's no thirsting for the things
Of the world, they've taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, 
 and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter 
 abides with me!"
252;That Man From Galilee;Eb;"In a manger long ago, 
I know it's really so,
A Babe was born 
To save men from their sin.
John saw Him on the shore, 
The Lamb forevermore,
Oh, the Christ, 
The Crucified of Calvary.

CHORUS
Oh I love that Man from Galilee,
For He's done so very much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins, 
Placed the Holy Ghost within;
Oh I love that man 
     from Galilee.

The publican went to pray 
In the temple there one day,
He cried, ""O Lord 
     be merciful to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this Man 
     from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk, 
The dumb was made to talk,
That power was spoken with 
Love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see, 
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man 
     from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of Man 
What must he do.
These words He said to him, 
""Ye must be born again,""
By the Spirit of that Man 
     from Galilee.

The woman at the well, 
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands 
She had at that time,
She was forgiven of every sin, 
And a deep peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that 
     Man from Galilee!"""
253;Then Jesus Came;C;"One sat alone beside the 
    highway begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he 
    could not see;
He clutched his rags and shivered 
    in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and bade his 
    darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the tempter's 
    power is broken;
When Jesus comes, the tears 
    are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the 
    life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus 
    comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil 
    spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
He cut himself as demon pow'rs 
    possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the 
    captive free.

Unclean! unclean! The leper cried 
    in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness 
    stood near;
The fever raged, disease had gripped 
    its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast 
    out every fear.

So men today have found the 
    Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion, 
    lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them sad 
    and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt 
    Himself within."
254;Such Love;F;"That God should love 
A sinner such as I,
Should yearn to change
My sorrow into bliss,
Nor rest till He 
Had planned to bring me nigh,
How wonderful is love like this!

CHORUS
Such love, such wondrous love,
Such love, such wondrous love,
That God should love 
A sinner such as I,
How wonderful is love like this!

That Christ should join 
So freely in the scheme,
Although it meant 
His death on Calvary,
Did ever human tongue 
Find nobler theme
Than love divine 
That ransomed me?

That for a wilful 
Outcast such as I,
The Father planned, 
The Saviour bled and died;
Redemption for 
A worthless slave to buy,
Who long had law 
And grace defied.

And now He takes me 
To His heart, a son,
He asks me not 
To fill a servant's place;
The ""far-off country"" 
Wand'rings all are done,
Wide open are 
His arms of grace."
255;When The Saints March In;Eb;"I'm a pilgrim and a stranger
Wand'ring through this world of sin,
On my way to that fair city,
When the Saints go marching in.

CHORUS
When the saints go marching in,
When the saints go marching in,
Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in.

Oh, I know I'll see my Saviour 
If my life is free from sin,
Heaven's doors will open for me
When the Saints go marching in.

When we gather 'round the Throne
And the gates are closed within,
I'll be shouting ""Glory, Glory""
When the Saints go marching in.

I'm waiting for the chariot
To swing low and I'll step in,
On the clouds I'll ride to Heaven
When the Saints go marching in."
256;The Day Of Redemption;F;"Nations are breaking, 
Israel's awaking,
The signs that the prophets 
     foretold;
The Gentile days numbered, 
With horrors encumbered;
Eternity soon will unfold.

CHORUS
The day of redemption is here,
Men's hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Your lamps trimmed and clear,
Look up! Your redemption is here.

The fig tree is growing; 
Jerusalem's restoring
Her national life, long dethroned;
Today she is calling, 
Her latter rain's falling,
""Return, Oh dispersed, to your own.""

Heaven's powers are shaking, 
And many are mistaking
God's meaning to be of the sky;
God's Church is the power
That's shaking this hour:
The day of redemption is nigh.

False prophets are lying, 
God's Truth they're denying,
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generation 
Spurns God's revelation,
We'll walk where the apostles 
     have trod."
257;Oh My Loving Brother;F;"Oh the judgment day is coming
What an awful day 'twill be,
Christ forever is my refuge
Rock of ages cleft for me.

CHORUS
Oh, my loving brother,
When the world's on fire,
Don't you want God's bosom
To be your pillow,
Hide me over in the rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me.

At the sounding of the trumpet,
At the dawning of the day,
Worldly pleasures with their treasures,
Shall forever pass away.

Poor lost sinners will be crying,
For the home they'll never see,
But the ransomed will be singing
Rock of ages, cleft for me."
258;Lights Of That City;F;"John tells of a city, 
That he saw coming down,
Where no sorrow or death will be known,
That someday we could go there
Through His marvelous grace,
Forever live in that heavenly home.

CHORUS
I can almost see the lights of that city,
I see them gathering, all around
The great white throne;
With faith in my Saviour,
And His wonderful love,
Oh, I can almost see the lights of home.

And sometimes when I'm burdened,
And my cross seems hard to bear.
And old Satan, he tries to dim my view,
Well I just look unto Jesus,
He is standing close by,
Then once again, 
His great light shines through."
259;I'm Looking For A City;F;"I'm looking for a city,
The one not made by hands,
I'm looking over Jordan,
I see the promised land,
The waters will be parted
And I'll be on my way,
As we're crossing over Jordan 
I can say:

CHORUS
Now I have that everlasting joy within,
Since He came and took away my sin,
The moment that He blessed me,
He made me fully whole,
With that everlasting joy 
Within my soul.

I'm drinking from the fountain
That floweth from on high,
A well of blessed waters
That never shall run dry,
I'm feasting on God's manna,
I'm praying day by day,
And that everlasting joy 
Is here to stay.

I've heard the prophet's message, 
I've placed it in my heart,
I've got the revelation 
That never shall depart,
The Rapture is upon us,
The stage is set to go.
We have this precious promise 
We all know."
260;All That Thrills My Soul;Bb;"Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
By His presence all divine?
True and Tender, pure and precious,
Oh how blest to call Him mine!

CHORUS
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me;
And the fairest of ten thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.

Love of Christ so freely given,
Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea.

What a wonderful redemption!
Never can a mortal know
How my sin, tho' red like crimson,
Can be whiter than the snow.

Every need His hand supplying,
Every good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying,
He is all in all to me.

By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King."
261;Come And Go With Me;F;"Come and go with me
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House,
To my Father's House.
Come and go with me,
To my Father's House,
Where There's peace, peace, peace.

Jesus will be there
In my Father's House
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House.
Jesus will be there
In my Father's House,
Where there's peace, peace, peace.

There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House,
In my Father's House, 
In my Father's House.
There'll be no sorrow there
In my Father's House.
There'll be joy, real joy."
262;I'll Fly Away;G;"Some glad morning 
When this life is o'er
I'll fly away,
To a home on God's 
     celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away, oh glory, 
I'll fly away;
Before I die, 
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows 
Of this life have grown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird from prison 
     bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more 
Weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys 
     shall never end,
I'll fly away."
263;It Is Love;F;"There is something in my soul 
Which keeps the shadows all away;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something lightens ev'ry burden,
Gives me gladness day by day,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

CHORUS
Oh the precious love of Jesus,
How it thrills my ransomed soul!
More and more I'll sing its praises
While the happy ages roll.

When the tempter tries to win me
Something keeps me true and strong;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something makes my life a blessing
To the needy in the throng,
It is love, my Saviour's love.

When misfortune overtakes me
Something calms my troubled breast;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
Something draws my soul to heaven,
That sweet land of peace and rest.
It is love, my Saviour's love.

Soul astray and bowed in sorrow,
Something waits for you today;
It is love, my Saviour's love!
It would give you peace and comfort,
Make your burdens roll away,
It is love, my Saviour's love."
264;My Sins Are Gone;Eb;"You ask me why I'm happy
So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;
And when I meet the scoffers
Who ask me where they are,
I say, my sins are gone.

CHORUS
They're underneath the Blood,
Of the Cross of Calvary,
As far removed as darkness 
     is from dawn;
In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
That's good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me 
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

I'm living now for Jesus,
I'm happy night and day,
Because my sins are gone;
My soul is filled with music,
With all my heart I say,
I know my sins are gone."
265;He Set Me Free;F;"Once like a bird 
In prison I dwelt.
No freedom from 
My sorrow I felt.
Then Jesus came 
And listened to me,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

CHORUS
He set me free, 
Yes, He set me free.
He broke the bonds 
Of prison for me.
I'm glory bound 
My Jesus to see,
Glory to God, 
He set me free.

Now I am climbing 
Higher each day,
Darkness of night 
Has drifted away.
My feet are planted 
On higher ground,
Glory to God, 
I'm homeward bound.

Good-bye to sin 
And things that confound,
Naught of this world 
Shall turn me around,
Daily I'm working, 
I'm praying too,
Glory to God, 
I'm going through."
266;The Great Emancipator;Ab;"Once my heart and soul were fettered
By the binding chains of sin.
But the Great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Blessed be His holy name!
He's the Great Emancipator,
That's the song of the Redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting
Oh so helpless and alone, 
But the seeking Shepherd found me,
Led me to my Father's home."
267;The Original Life;Ab;"God's attributes were manifested
To His Bride in this last age.
We have caught the revelation
By the last prophet's message.
And we know who we are
And what we are raised up for,
Praise the Lord, for the Original Life.

CHORUS
The Original Life, the Original Seed
The Original Word is what I believe.
The Son of Man is revealed
The seventh seal is unveiled
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say.
And our names are seen within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin.
Yes, we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who's the Original Life.

Our eyes of understanding
He has opened up at last.
And sweet victory is ours
Who were chained down in the past.
True Jubilee has sounded
And we have responded
To our God, Who's the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power.
Sleeping saints will wake and join us
For translation in this hour.
Gentiles' days will soon be over
Glory, hallelujah!
To our God, Who's the Original Life."
268;All In All;F;"Of Jesus love I'm singing
I praise Him every day;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He frees my soul from bondage,
He takes my guilt away;
Jesus is my All in All.

CHORUS
All in All, All in All,
A strength in time of weariness
A light when shadows fall.
All in All, All in All,
Jesus is my All in All.

He's patient and so tender,
So loving and so kind;
He is my All in All, All in All.
Another Friend so faithful
My soul will never find;
Jesus is my All in All.

In time of need no other
To me can prove so dear;
He is my All in All, All in All.
He hears me tho' I whisper,
To help me he is near;
Jesus is my All in All."

More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

CHORUS
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love, who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus in His Word, 
Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace."
271;Psalm 19;Eb;"The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure,
Making wise the simple.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The statutes of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure,
Enlightening the eyes.
More to be desired are they than gold,
Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey 
     and the honeycomb.

The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.
And in the keeping of them
There is great reward,
There is great reward.
In the keeping of them
There is great reward."
272;The Church's One Foundation;C;"The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord:
She is His new creation
By water and the Word.
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth,
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping
Their cry goes up, ""How long?""
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song.

Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore.
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the church at rest."
273;His Banner Over Me Is Love;F;"He  brought me to 
His banqueting table
His banner over me is love;

His banner over me is love.

He set straight paths 
before my feet
His banner over me is love,
     (repeat 3 times)
His banner over me is love.

He broke the chains 
and He set me free
His banner over me is love

I am my Beloved's 
and He is mine
His banner over me is love,

274;Deeper In That Holy Life;F;"Deeper In Thy love, Oh Jesus
Doth my spirit cry to go.
Until all my life is hidden 
Deep within the cleansing flow.

CHORUS
Deeper in that holy life
'Til I'm lost with Christ in God.
Hidden with my blessed Lord
While I walk this earthly sod.

Humbly must I walk with Jesus
In the paths that He doth lead.
Never falter, never murmur
Always to His voice give heed.

Daily must I seek to please Him
Whether it bring joy or pain.
I shall know then just how blessed
Is the worth of Heav'nly gain.

Deeper, 'til at last in Glory
In His likeness I shall come.
Where the saints of all the ages
Shall receive their welcome home."
275;We Are Heirs;Ab;"We are heirs of the Father
We are joint-heirs with the Son.
We are people of His Kingdom

We are washed,
We are sanctified.
We are cleansed by His blood.
We are born of the Spirit
We are children of the Lord.

We are members of His body.
We are objects of His love.
We're partakers of His holiness
We are citizens of heaven above.

We're partakers of His suffering;
We're partakers of His grace.
We shall meet Him to be like Him
We shall see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming
We are looking to the skies;
We are watching, we are waiting,
We shall dwell with Him, we 
    shall rise.

We shall reign with Him forever;
Men and angels shout and sing.
For dominion has been given
To the family of the King."
276;He's The Lord Of Glory;Eb;"Behold what manner of man is this,
Who stills the raging sea.
He heals the sick, the lame, the halt,
And makes the blind to see.
He opens all the prison doors
And sets the captives free.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

CHORUS
He's the Lord of glory
He is the great ""I Am""
The Alpha and Omega,
The beginning and the end.
His name is Wonderful
The Prince of Peace is He
He's the everlasting Father
Throughout eternity.

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who spake to the woman at the well.
Everlasting life I will give to thee,
Far richer than man can tell
And whosoever shall drink of the well
Shall live eternally.
Behold what manner of man is this,
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who speaks to the lame and halt.
He says ""Thy sins be forgiven thee,
Take up thy bed and walk""
He stands as the mighty healer now
And cries ""Come unto me""
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this
Who stands between God and man.
His eyes are as a flame of fire
His fan is in His hand.
John saw Him in the seven churches
As the sun in brilliancy
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?

Behold what manner of man is this,
Who sits on His heavenly throne.
He rules and reigns from heaven above
His beloved and His own.
He's the lion of the tribe of Judah,
The root of David is He.
Behold what manner of man is this
What manner of man is He?"
277;He Touched Me;Eb;"Shackled by a heavy burden
'Neath a load of guilt and shame,
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same.

Oh, He touched me,
And oh, the joy 
That floods my soul!
Something happened, 
And now I know,
He touched me, 
And made me whole.

Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed 
And made me whole,
I shall never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls."
278;This World Is Not My Home;F;"This world is not my home
I'm just a'passing through
My treasures are laid up 
Somewhere beyond the blue.
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

CHORUS
Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

They're all expecting me
And that's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus
Many years ago.
I know He'll see me through
Tho' I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Just over in the gloryland,
We'll live eternally;
The saints on every hand
Are shouting ""victory"".
The songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore."
279;Lead Me To Calvary;Eb;"King of my life I crown Thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned 
     brow,
Lead me to Calvary.

CHORUS
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget Thine agony,
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou 
     wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept:
Angels in robes of light arrayed,
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me, like Mary, through 
     the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee:
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear,
Daily my cross for Thee:
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Fill me, Oh Lord, with Thy desire,
For all who know not Thee:
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
To speak of Calvary."
280;I Don't Know What I'd Do;F;"I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord;
When I look around and see,
All that He has done for me,
I don't know what I'd do 
Without the Lord.

281;Whisper A Prayer;F;"Whisper a prayer in the morning,
Whisper a prayer at noon,
Whisper a prayer in the evening,
To keep your heart in tune.

God answers prayer in the morning,

God answers prayer in the evening,
So keep your heart in tune.

Jesus may come in the morning,
Jesus may come at noon,
Jesus may come in the evening,
So keep your heart in tune."
282;It Is Well With My Soul;C;"When peace like a river
Attendeth my way,
When sorrows, 
Like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, 
Thou hast taught me to say,
""It is well, it is well with my soul.""

CHORUS
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well 
With my soul.

Tho' Satan should buffet,
Tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control.
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood
     for my soul.

My sin - oh, the bliss 
Of this glorious thought -
My sin - not in part, 
But the whole
Is nailed to the cross;
And I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Oh my soul.

And Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight.
The clouds be rolled back 
     as a scroll.
The trump shall resound, 
And the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee,
For Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, 
     is our goal;
Oh, the shout of the angel!
Oh, the voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope!
Blessed rest of my soul!

283;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God;C;"A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe -
His craft and pow'r are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He -
Lord Sabaoth His name,
From age to age the same -
And He must win the battle.

And tho this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph thru us.
The Prince of darkness grim - 
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! His doom is sure -
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow'rs -
No thanks to them - abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Thru Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still -
His kingdom is forever."

285;Arise, My Soul, Arise;Ab;"Arise, my soul, arise;
Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding sacrifice
    in my behalf appears:
Before the throne my surety stands,
Before the throne my surety stands,
My name is written on His hands.

He ever lives above, 
For me to intercede;
His all redeeming love, 
His precious blood, to plead:
His blood atoned for all our race,
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

Five bleeding wounds He bears;
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers; 
They strongly plead for me:
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Nor let that ransomed sinner die!""

The Father hears Him pray,
His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away, 
The presence of His Son;
His Spirit answers to the blood,
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.

My God is reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear:
With confidence I now draw nigh,
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And ""Father, Abba, Father,"" cry."
286;His Way With Thee;F;"Would you live for Jesus and 
     be always pure and good?
Would you walk with Him 
     within the narrow road?
Would you have Him bear your 
     burden, carry all your load?
Let Him have His way with thee.

CHORUS
His pow'r can make you what you
     ought to be,
His blood can cleanse your heart
     and make you free:
His love can fill your soul,
And you will see 'twas best for Him
To have His way with Thee.

Would you have Him make you free, 
     and follow at His call?
Would you know the peace that
     comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you,
     so that you need never fall?
Let Him have His way with Thee.

Would you in His kingdom find
     a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true
     in providential test?
Would you in His service labour
     always at your best?
Let Him have His way with Thee."
287;I'm Longing For Jesus To Come;F;"I'm longing for that glorious day
When Jesus shall come back,
I long to see His blessed face.
When all the saints 
Throughout the ages
Shall be gathered home
The ones who trusted in His grace

CHORUS
I'm longing for Jesus to come back
I long for Jesus Christ my King
To come and take me
To my home beyond the skies,
Up there where angels shout and sing.

Sometimes the road 
Seems rough and hard,
The pathway seems so long,
But He is ever by my side.
He whispers loving words to me
And tells me to be strong,
That He will always lead and guide."
288;Thank God I Am Free;G;"For a long time I travelled
Down a long lonely road;
My heart was so heavy in sin I sank low.
Then I heard about Jesus,
What a wonderful hour;
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out
Through His saving power.

CHORUS
Thank God I am free, free, free
From this world of sin.
Been washed in the blood of Jesus,
I've been born again.
Hallelujah, I'm saved, saved, saved
By His wonderful grace.
I'm so glad that I found out
He could bring me out 
And show me the way.

Like a bird out of prison
That's taken its flight;
Like a blind man that God 
Gave back  his sight.
Like a poor wretched beggar
That's found fortune and fame,
I'm so glad that I found out 
He could bring me out
Thro' His Holy name."
289;Land Of Milk And Honey;G;"There is a land of milk and honey
There is a land
Where we won't need money.
There is a land 
Shining with jasper.
There we shall see 
Our blessed Saviour.

CHORUS
And that's the reason
We shout ""Hallelujah""
Praising our King across the river.
That shining river
Where the saints will gather
There we shall see 
Our blessed Messiah.

Elijah has come, 
He has done his work already
As John has said, 
The Bride has made ready.
And now we are waiting 
For the coming of Jesus.
For that blessed day
When the Lamb shall take us.

Our hopes are bright, 
Our lamps are burning.
And day by day 
Our hearts are yearning.
This is the evening
He will come in the morning.
Then we shall wait 
Until the morning."
290;He Paid A Debt;C;"He paid a debt He did not owe,
I owed a debt I could not pay,
I needed someone to wash 
     my sins away;
And now I sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay.

He paid a debt at Calvary,
He cleansed my soul and 
     set me free,
I'm glad that Jesus did all 
     my sins erase.
I now can sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay.

One day He's coming back for me,
To live with Him eternally,
Won't it be glory to see Him 
     on that day!
I then will sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long
Christ Jesus paid a debt 
That I could never pay."
291;Until Then;Ab;"My heart can sing 
When I pause to remember,
A heartache here  
Is but a stepping stone,
Along the trail 
That's winding always upward,
This troubled world 
Is not my final home.

CHORUS
But until then, 
My heart will go on singing,
Until then, 
With joy I'll carry on.
Until the day 
Mine eyes behold the city
Until the day 
God calls me home.

The things of earth 
Will dim and lose their value,
If we recall, 
They're borrowed for awhile
And things of earth 
That cause the heart to tremble
Remember there, 
Will only bring a smile.

This weary world 
With all its toil and struggle,
May take its toll 
Of misery and strife,
The soul of man 
Is like a waiting eagle
When it's released 
It's destined for the sky."
292;This Is Like Heaven To Me;F;"We find many people 
Who can't understand
Why we are so happy and free,
We've crossed over Jordan 
To Canaan's fair land,
And this is like heaven to me.

CHORUS
Oh this is like heaven to me,
Yes, this is like heaven to me 
(Praise God).
I've crossed over Jordan 
To Canaan's fair land,
And this is like heaven to me.

Oh,  when I get happy 
I sing and I shout,
The devil don't believe it, I see;
But I'm filled with the Spirit, 
There isn't a doubt,
And thats what's the matter with me."
293;I've Been Changed;Ab;"I've been to the water,
And I've been baptized,
I've been washed 
In the blood of the Lamb;
I've been changed 
From the creature
That I once was,
And redeemed is now my name.

CHORUS
I've been changed, 
I've been reborn,
All my life has been rearranged;
What a difference it makes
When the Lord has His way
All my life praise God, 
Has been changed.

Tho' my sins were as scarlet
They're white as snow,
I was bound but today I am free;
I was lost in the darkness
But now I'm found,
I was blind but now I see.

When at last in His presence
I stand above,
He will wipe every tear 
From my eyes;
And I'll thank Him for giving 
A wretch like me,
A new home beyond the sky."
294;I'm In That Number;Ab;"I'm in that number, I'm in that number,
I'm in that number robed in white;
I'm in that number, I'm in that number,
I'm in that number robed in white.

That blood-washed number,
That blood-washed number,
I'm in that number robed in white;
That blood-washed number
That blood-washed number,
I'm in that number robed in white.

John saw that number,
The blood-washed number,
John saw that number robed in white;
John saw that number,

295;Let Go Of The Old;Eb;"Let, let go of the old,
And lay, lay hold on the new,
In laying it down a new life is found
There a new life waits for you.

Cast your bread upon the waters
After many days it shall return.
If you pour out your soul
Not a part, but the whole
A new life is there for you.

In saving your life, you will lose it,
But by losing it, you will find it,
Down in the ground 
That's where death is found,
Death that brings life anew."
296;Cause Me To Come;F;"Cause me to come to

With thorns they crowned His head,

It satisfies my longings, 
As nothing else can do.

I love to tell the story!  
'Twill be my theme in glory
To tell the old, old story  
Of Jesus and His love.

I love to tell the story;  
More wonderful it seems 
Than all the golden fancies  
Of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story, 
It did so much for me;
And that is just the reason 
I tell it now to thee

I love to tell the story; 
'Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems each time I tell it,  
More wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story;
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God's own holy word.

I love to tell the story;
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,  
I sing the new, new song,
'Twill be the old, old story, 
That I have loved so long."

Who never knew our God:
But children of the
     heav'nly King,
But children of the 
     heav'nly King,
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the 
     heav'nly fields,
Before we reach the 
     heav'nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets,

For the cross of Calvary.

Chorus
Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story 
Of the Christ who died for me
Sing it with the saints in glory, 
Gathered by the crystal sea.

I was lost, but Jesus found me,  
Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me, 
Drew me back into the way.

I was bruised but Jesus healed me,  
Faint was I from many a fall,
Sight was gone, 
And fears possessed me, 
But He freed me from them all.

Soon He'll come the Lord of Glory,  
Come the church His bride to claim,
And complete the wondrous story, 
Come, Lord Jesus, come again.

He will keep me till the river  
Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He'll bear me safely over, 
Where the loved ones I shall meet."

In the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life
In the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away,
He holdeth me up, 
And I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

With numberless blessings
Each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,
For such a Redeemer as mine!

When clothed in His brightness,
Transported I rise,
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, 
His wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high."

Do you want the fire of God
     to fill your soul,
Burn up all the dross,
     and sanctify the whole?

Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

Do you want the pow'r
     to make you true and brave,
So that you can rescue
     those that Christ would save?
Make the consecration,
Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in."

Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of blessing.  
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,  
Come, and now honor Thy Word.

Though these people may not 
      learned be,
Nor boast of worldly fame,
They have all received their Pentecost,
Baptized in Jesus' name;
And are telling now, both far and wide,
His pow'r is yet the same,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

They were gathered in the upper room,
All praying in His name,
They were baptized with the 
     Holy Ghost,
And pow'r for service came;
Now what He did for them that day
He'll do for you the same;
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!

Come, my brother, seek this blessing
That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy-bells ringing
And will keep the soul aflame;
It is burning now within my heart,
All glory to His name,
I'm so glad that I can say 
I'm one of them!"
322;Living Where the Healing Waters Flow;F;"I've cast my heavy burdens down

Chorus 
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, 
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

With Israel's trusting children
     I'm rejoicing on my way, 
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
The cloudy, fiery pillar
     is my guiding light today.
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

My hung'ring soul is satisfied 
     with manna from above,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
No more I thirst, the rock I've found,
      that fount of endless love;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

I'm singing ""Hallelujah,""
      safely anchored in my soul,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
I'm resting on his promises;

A strange and tranquil rest.

Chorus
There's a deep, settled peace in my soul,
There's a deep settled peace in my soul;
Tho' the billows of sin near me roll, 
He abides, Christ abides.

Beneath the toil and care of life,
This hidden stream flows on;
My weary soul no longer thirsts,
Nor am I sad and lone.

I cannot tell the half of love,
Unfeigned, supreme, divine,
That caused my darkest in-most self
With beams of hope to shine.

I cannot tell thee why He chose
To suffer and to die,
But if I suffer here with Him
I'll reign with Him on high."
324;I Would Not Be Denied;C;"When pangs of death 
Seized on my soul,

CHORUS
I would not be denied,

Till Jesus came and 
     made me whole,
I would not be denied.

As Jacob in the days of old,
I wrestled with the Lord;
And instant, with 
     a courage bold,
I stood upon His word.

Old Satan said my Lord 
     was gone
And would not hear my prayer,
But, praise the Lord! 
The work is done
And Christ the Lord is here."
325;The Solid Rock;F;"My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

CHORUS
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne."

In the love of Jesus
Daily let me go;
Higher, higher,
In the school of wisdom,
More of grace to know.

Deeper yet, I pray,
And higher every day,
And wiser, blessed Lord,
In Thy precious, holy Word.

Deeper, deeper!  
Blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is 
Wholly lost in Jesus,
And His perfect will.

Deeper, deeper! 
Though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the 
Holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

Deeper, higher, 
Every day in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqueror, 
And in His own image
Perfected at last."

What the Lord has done!
Glory to His name.

He keeps me every moment  
By trusting in His grace;
'Tis thro His blest atonement,  
That I may see His face.

He brings me through affliction,  
He leaves me not alone;
He's with me in temptation, 
He keeps me for His own.

He prospers and protects me,  
His blessings ever flow;
He fills me with His glory, 
He makes me white as snow.

He keeps me firm and faithful,  
His love I do enjoy,
For this I shall be grateful,
And live in His employ.

There's not a single blessing  
Which we receive on earth
That does not come from heaven,  
The source of our new birth."
328;BEULAH LAND, SWEET BEULAH LAND;F;"I've reached the land of corn and wine, 
And all its riches freely mine;

Oh Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.
As on Thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory-shore,
My heav'n, my home forevermore!

My Savior comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by the hand, 
For this is heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from eververnal trees,
And flow'rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody.
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song."

A weary land, A weary land;
Oh Jesus is a Rock in a weary land -
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shade by day, defense by night,
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes afright,
A shelter in the time of storm.

The raging storms may round us beat,
A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.

Oh Rock divine, Oh Refuge dear,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our Helper ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm."
330;The Haven Of Rest;F;"My soul in sad exile 
Was out on life's sea,
So burdened with sin 
     and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice 
Saying, ""Make me your choice;""
And I entered the Haven of Rest.

CHORUS
I've anchored my soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
I'll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep 
O'er the wild, stormy deep;
In Jesus I'm safe evermore.

I yielded myself 
To his tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, 
And I anchored my soul;
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, 
Since the Lord made me whole,    
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus who'll save 
Whosoever will have
A home in the Haven of Rest.

How precious the thought 
That we all may recline,
Like John the beloved and blest,
On Jesus' strong arm 
Where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the Haven of Rest.

Oh come to the Savior, 
He patiently waits,
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul 
In the Haven of Rest,
And say, ""My Beloved is mine."""
331;There Is A Fountain Filled With Blood;Bb;"There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away,
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Thou dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God
Are saved, to sin no more,
Are saved, to sin no more,
Are saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God
Are saved, to sin no more.

For since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave."

Bound to Him eternally 
By love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily 
With the Spirit's sword,

Listening every moment 
To the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Savior 
As my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God."
333;How Firm A Foundation;G;"How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!

Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, I will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee and cause thee
     to stand,
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.
Upheld by my gracious, omnipotent hand.

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine,
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for  repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor
     to shake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!
I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"

Within my closet door retreating,
I love to be alone with God.

Chorus
Alone with God, the world forbidden.
Alone with God, Oh blest retreat!
Alone with God and in Him hidden,
To hold with Him communion sweet.

What tho' the clouds have 
    gathered o'er me?
What tho' I've passed beneath the rod?
God's perfect will there lies before me,
When I am thus alone with God.

'Tis there I find new strength for duty,
As o'er the sands of time I plod;
I see the King in all His beauty.
While resting there alone with God.

And when I see the moment nearing
When I shall sleep beneath the sod,
When time with me is disappearing,
I want to be alone with God."

Marching on, I am marching on;
Vict'ry's mine, while I've Christ within,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on while the skeptics sneer, 
Marching on, I am marching on;
Perfect love casteth out all fear,
Marching, marching on.

Marching on, I am marching on;
Preaching Christ to the dying world,
Marching, marching on."

Who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus 
A pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,

Through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher,

Cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wandering 
Sinner to find.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless, 
Patient and brave;
Meekly enduring 
Cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer, 
Others to save.

Oh to be like Thee, 
Lord, I am coming,
Now to receive 
Th' anointing divine,
All that I am and have 
I am bringing,
Lord, from this moment 
All shall be Thine.

Oh to be like Thee, 
While I am pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit, 
Fill with Thy love,
Make me a temple 
Meet for Thy dwelling,
Fit me for life 
And heaven above."
338;Count Your Blessings;C;"When upon life's billows 
You are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged, 
Thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you 
What the Lord hath done.

CHORUS
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
Count your blessings,
See what God hath done;
Count your blessings,
Name them one by one;
And it will surprise you 
What the Lord has done.

Are you ever burdened 
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing 
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised 
You His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings, 
Money cannot buy
Your reward in Heaven, 
Nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict, 
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, 
God is over all;
Count your many blessings, 
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you 
To your journey's end."
339;What A Friend;F;"What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there."
340;I Will Praise Him;C;"When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing,
When He said, Wilt thou be clean?

CHORUS
I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His blood has washed away 
     each stain.

Though the way seems straight 
     and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him,
Glory, glory to His name!

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in;
He's forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin."
341;Ho! Everyone that Is Thirsty;F;"Ho! ev'ry one that is thirsty in spirit,
Ho! ev'ry one that is weary and sad,
Come to the fountain, 
There's fullness in Jesus,
All that you're longing for, 
Come and be glad.

Chorus
""I will pour water on him 
    who is thirsty, 
I will pour floods upon 
     the dry ground;
Open your heart 
For the gift I am bringing,
While ye are seeking Me, 
I will be found.""

Child of the world, 
Are you tired of your bondage?
Weary of earth-joys,
So false, so untrue;
Thirsting for God, 
And his fullness of blessing?
List to the promise -- 
A message for you.

Child of the kingdom, 
Be filled with the Spirit, 
Nothing but fullness 
Thy longing can meet.
'Tis the enduement 
For life and for service;
Thine is the promise, 
So certain, so sweet."
342;Feasting With My Lord;F;"Since my soul is saved 
     and sanctified,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
In this land of Canaan I'll abide,
Feasting with my Lord.

CHORUS
Feasting, I am feasting,
Feasting with my Lord;
Feasting, I am feasting
On the living Word.

Feeding on the honey 
     and the wine,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Gathering the clusters 
     from the vine,
Feasting with my Lord.

Day by day we have 
     a new supply,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
And the food is never 
     stale nor dry,
Feasting with my Lord.

Many times we have 
     an extra spread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
Then to deeper truths 
     I have been led,
Feasting with my Lord.

Often there are only 
     just us two,
Feasting I'm feasting
Then He tells me what 
     He'd have me do,
Feasting with my Lord.

If perchance the cupboard's
     scarce of bread,
Feasting, I'm feasting,
On the hidden manna 
      I am fed,
Feasting with my Lord."
343;Oh Say, But I'm Glad;C;"There is a song in my heart today,
Something I never had;
Jesus has taken my sins away,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

CHORUS
Oh say, but I'm glad, I'm glad,
Oh say, but I'm glad;
Jesus has come 
And my cup's overrun;
Oh say but I'm glad.

Wonderful, marvelous 
Love He brings,
Into a heart that's sad;
Through darkest tunnels 
The soul just sings,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

We have a fellowship 
Rich and sweet,
Tongues can never relate;
Abiding in Him is a real treat,
Oh say, but I'm glad.

Won't you come to Him 
With all your care,
Weary and worn and sad?
You too, will sing 
As His love you share.
Oh say, but I'm glad."
344;The Comforter Has Come;C;"O spread the tidings 'round,
      wherever man is found,
Wherever human hearts
      and human woes abound;
Let ev'ry Christian tongue
      proclaim the joyful sound:
The Comforter has come!

Chorus
The Comforter has come, 
The Comforter has come!
The Holy Ghost from Heav'n, 
The Father's promise giv'n;
O spread the tidings 'round, 
     wherever man is found --
The Comforter has come!

The long, long night is past, 
     the morning breaks at last,
And hushed the dreadful wail 
     and fury of the blast,
As o'er the golden hills 
     the day advances fast!
The Comforter has come!

Lo, the great King of kings,
      with healing in His wings,
To ev'ry captive soul 
     a full deliv'rance brings;
And thro' the vacant cells
      the song of triumph rings;
The Comforter has come!

O boundless love divine! 
      how shall this tongue of mine 
To wond'ring mortals tell
      the matchless grace divine
That I, a child of hell,
      should in His image shine!
The Comforter has come!"
345;Trust And Obey;F;"When we walk with the Lord
In the Light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

CHORUS
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey."
346;The Breaking of the Day;Eb;"'Tis almost time for the Lord to come, 
I hear the people say;
The stars of heav'n are growing dim:
It must be the breaking of the day.

Chorus
O, it must be the breaking of the day,
O, it must be the breaking of the day;
The night is almost gone,
The day is coming on:
O, it must be the breaking of the day.

The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
In earth and sea and sky,
Aloud proclaim to mortal men,
That the coming of the Master
     draweth nigh.

It must be time for the waiting church 
To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps
To look for the breaking of the day.

There must be those in the field of sin,
Far from the fold astray,
Who once were happy in Jesus' love,
And looking for the breaking of the day.

Go quickly out in the streets and lanes,
And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt and blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the day."
347;Faith Of Our Fathers! Living Still;G;"Faith of our fathers! living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
Oh how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word

CHORUS
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children's fate,
If they, like them, could die for Thee!

Faith of our fathers! we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, 
As love knows how,
By kindly words and virtuous life!"
348;Under His Wings;C;"Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Though the night deepens 
     and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him, 
I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, 
And I am His child.

CHORUS
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

Under His wings, 
What a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly 
Turns to His rest!
Often when earth has 
No balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, 
And there I am blest.

Under His wings, 
O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till 
Life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, 
No evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus 
I'm safe evermore."
349;Lead Me, Savior;C;"Savior lead me, lest I stray,
Gently lead me all the way;
I am safe when by Thy side, 
I would in Thy love abide.

Chorus
Lead me, lead me, Savior, 
lead me, lest I stray;
Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me Savior, all the way.

Thou the refuge of my soul,
When life's stormy billows roll,
I am safe when Thou art nigh,
All my hopes on Thee rely.

Savior, lead me, then at last, 
When the storm of life is past,
To the land of endless day, 
Where all tears are wiped away."
350;I See A Crimson Stream;Ab;"On Calvary's hill of sorrow
Where sin's demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid.

CHORUS
I see a crimson stream of blood.
It flows from Calvary,
Its waves which reach 
     the throne of God,
Are sweeping over me.

Today no condemnation
Abides to turn away
My soul from His salvation,
He's in my heart to stay.

When gloom and sadness whisper
You've sinned, no use to pray,
I look away to Jesus,
And He tells me to say:

And when we reach the portal
Where life forever reigns,
The ransomed hosts grand final
Will be this glad refrain."
351;Like Zion's Holy Mount;C;"All they who put their trust in God
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount,
By many ages proved.

Chorus
Like the mount of God, 
Like the mount of God;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
By many ages proved.
They can never be removed, removed;
They stand secure like Zion's mount, 
They can never be removed.

As round about Jerusalem
The rugged mountains lie,
So round about His holy saints
Our God is ever nigh.

Tho' fierce the storm in fury beat
And awful thunders roar,
The children of the mighty God
Are safe forevermore.

Thus over-shadowed by His love,
Where harm can ne'er betide,
Within this refuge safe and sure
I ever would abide"
352;My Faith Looks Up To Thee;Eb;"My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Savior divine!
Now hear me while I pray,
Take all my sin away,
O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When ends life's transient dream,
When death's cold, sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll;
Blest Savior, then, in love,
Fear and distrust remove;
O bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul!"
353;Blessed Be The Name;Ab;"All praise to Him who reigns above,
In majesty supreme,
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem.

CHORUS
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

His name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father's own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.

His name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace;
Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man,
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,
For Thou hast died for all.

Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord;
Magnify the name, 
Magnify the name
Magnify the name of the Lord.

There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord;
There's healing in the name, 
Healing in the name
Healing in the name of the Lord.

Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord;
Jesus is the name, 
Jesus is the name,
Jesus is the name of the Lord."
354;Joy Unspeakable;Ab;"I have found His grace 
Is all complete,
He supplieth every need;
While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet,
I am free, yes free indeed.

CHORUS
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Oh, the half has never yet been told.

I have found the pleasure 
I once craved,
It is joy and peace within;
What a wondrous blessing! 
I am saved
From the awful guilt of sin.

I have found that hope 
So bright and clear,
Living in the realm of grace;
Oh, the Savior's presence is so near,
I can see His smiling face.

I have found the joy 
No tongue can tell,
How its waves of glory roll!
It is like a great o'erflowing well,
Springing up within my soul."
355;Higher Ground;Ab;"I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as I'm onward bound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

CHORUS
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on Heaven's table land,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell 
Where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till heaven I've found,
Lord, lead me on to higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground."
356;In the Twinkling of an Eye;Bb;"When the trump of the great archangel
Its mighty tones shall sound,
And, the end of the world proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of man shall come in His glory,
With all the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies 
     from the multitudes that rise,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Chorus
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
The trumpet shall sound, the dead 
     shall be raised,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

When He comes in the clouds descending,
And they who loved Him here,
From their graves shall awake and praise Him
With joy and not with fear;
When the body and the soul are united,
And clothed no more to die,
What a shouting there will be 
     when each other's face we see,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Oh the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in pow'r
And the songs of the blood-bought millions 
Shall hail that blissful hour;
When we gather safely home in the morning,
And night's dark shadows fly,
What a shouting on the shore
     when we meet to part no more,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye."
357;Break Thou The Bread Of Life;C;"Break Thou the bread of life,
Dear Lord to me,
As Thou didst break
The loaves beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page,
I seek Thee Lord;
My spirit pants for Thee,
Oh living Word!

Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord
To me, To me,
As Thou didst bless
The bread by Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My All in All.

Teach me to live, dear Lord,
Only for Thee,
As Thy disciples lived in Galilee;
Then, all my struggles o'er,
Then, victory won,
I shall behold Thee, Lord,
The living One."
358;Rock of Ages;Ab;"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side 
 which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make
 me pure.

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, 
 and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee."
359;Signs Are Everywhere;Bb;"The King is coming in glory 
To catch His bride away,
It may be in the morning  
It may be at mid-day, 
At the even or midnight; 
The trump will sound so clear,
The dead in Christ, and we that live,
His voice shall hear.

Chorus
The King is coming, hallelujah! 
He's coming in the air,
The fig tree is budding, 
The signs are everywhere,
The saints are looking ever up-ward
While jour'ning on their way, 
He's coming, hallelujah!
To catch his bride away.

Behold! He cometh, and leaping  
And skipping o'er the hills;
Like the young roe, like the young hart, 
My soul with rapture thrills; 
Thru the window He's looking,
Thru the lattice-work is seen, 
The winter's past, the rain is o'er, 
The figs are green.

The King is coming , ""Be ready,""  
To meet Him on that day;
With your heart right, 
     with your robes white,
And in this holy way;  
Like the light'ning that flashes
In the twinkling of an eye, 
Our Lord shall come to claim His own
He's drawing nigh."
360;I Remember Calvary;Eb;"Where He may lead me, I will go,
For I have learned to trust Him so,
And I remember 'twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

CHORUS
Jesus shall lead me night and day,
Jesus shall lead me all the way,
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

Oh, I delight in His command,
Love to be lead by His dear hand;
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.

Onward I go, no doubt, nor fear,
Happy with Christ my Savior near,
Trusting that I some day shall see,
Jesus, my Friend of Calvary."
361;Close To Thee;F;"Thou, my everlasting portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior let me walk with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior let me walk with Thee.

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Nor for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me through the vale of shadows,
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee close to Thee;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord with Thee."
362;Cleanse Me;F;"Search me, Oh God, 
And know my heart today;
Try me, Oh Savior, 
Know my thoughts, I pray:
See if there be some wicked 
     way in me:
Cleanse me from every sin, 
     and set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing 
     me from sin:
Fulfill Thy Word, and make me 
     pure within:
Fill me with fire where once 
I burned with shame:
Grant my desire to magnify 
     Thy name.

Lord take my life, and make it 
     wholly Thine:
Fill my poor heart with 
Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, 
     self and pride;
I now surrender: Lord in me abide.

Oh, Holy Ghost, revival comes 
     from Thee:
Send a revival, 
Start the work in me:
Thy Word declares, 
Thou wilt supply our need:
For blessing now, Oh Lord, 
     I humbly plead."
363;He Rolled the Sea Away;C;"When Israel out of bondage came,
A sea before them lay;
The Lord reach'd down 
    His mighty hand,
And rolled the sea away.

Chorus
Then forward still, 
    'tis Jehovah's will, 
Tho' the billows dash and spray,
With a conq'ring tread 
    we will push ahead
He'll roll the sea away.

Before me was a sea of sin,
So great I feared to pray;
My heart's desire the Savior read,
And rolled the sea away.

When sorrows dark, like stormy waves,
Were dashing o'er my way,
Again the Lord in mercy came, 
And rolled the sea away.

And when I reach the sea of death,
For needed grace I'll pray;
I know the Lord will quickly come,
And roll the sea away."
364;Oh That Will Be Glory;F;"When all my labors and trials are o'er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

CHORUS
Oh that will be glory for me,
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace 
I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.

When by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in Heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Friends will be there 
I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Savior, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me."
366;He Was Nailed To The Cross For Me;Eb;"What a wonderful, wonderful Savior,
Who would die on the cross for me!
Freely shedding His precious life blood,
That the sinner might be made free.

CHORUS
He was nailed to the cross for me,
He was nailed to the cross for me;
On the cross crucified, for me He died;
He was nailed to the cross for me.

Thus He left His heavenly glory
To accomplish His Father's plan;
He was born of the Virgin Mary,
Took upon Him the form of man.

He was wounded  for our transgressions,
And He carried our sorrows, too;
He's the Healer of every sickness,
This He came to the world to do.

So He gave His life for others
In redeeming this world from sin,
And He's gone to prepare a mansion,
That at last we may enter in."
367;Redeemed;Ab;"Redeemed how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child and forever, I am.

CHORUS
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night."
368;God Leads Us Along;Eb;"In shady green pastures, 
so rich and sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water's cool flow 
Bathes the weary one's feet,
God leads His dear children along.

CHORUS
Some thro' the waters, 
Some thro' the flood,
Some thro' the fire, 
But all thro' the blood;
Some thro' great sorrow, 
But God gives a song;
In the night season 
And all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount 
Where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley 
In the darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

Tho' sorrows befall us, 
And Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, 
Defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.

Away from the mire, 
And away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity's day.
God leads His dear children along."
369;He Brought Me Out;C;"My heart was distressed 
'Neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins 
Dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord 
From the deep, miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out 
     to golden day.

CHORUS
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah.

He placed me upon 
The strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established 
     and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling 
While here I remain,
But stand by His grace 
Until the crown I gain.

He gave me a song, 
'Twas a new song of praise,
By day and by night 
Its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing, 
I'm happy and free,
I'll praise my Redeemer, 
Who has rescued me.

I'll sing of His wonderful 
     mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men 
His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation 
At home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth 
And trust in God.

I'll tell of the pit, 
With its gloom and despair,
I'll praise the dear Father, 
Who answered my prayer;
I'll sing my new song, 
The glad story of love,
Then join in the chorus 
With the saints above."
370;Beneath The Cross Of Jesus;C;"Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the 
     noonday heat,
And the burden of the day.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart 
     with tears,
Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love
And my own worthlessness.

I take, Oh cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross."
371;Like a Mighty Sea;F;"My soul today is thirsting 
     for living streams divine,
To sweep from highest heaven 
     to this poor heart of mine;
I stand upon the promise, 
     in Jesus' name I plead;
Oh send the gracious current
     to satisfy my need.

Chorus
Like a mighty sea,
      like a mighty sea,
Comes the love of Jesus, 
     sweeping over me;
The waves of glory roll,
     the Savior to extol,
Comes the love of Jesus,
     sweeping o'er my soul.

I see the clouds arising,
     the mercy clouds of love,
That come to bring refreshing
   down from the throne above,
The earnest of the shower,
     just now to us is giv'n,
And now we wait, expecting 
     the floods of grace from heav'n.

The show'rs of grace are falling,
     the tide is rolling in,
The flood-tide of salvation,
     with pow'r to cleanse from sin;
It's surging thro' my being 
     and takes my sin away,
It keeps me shouting glory!
     thro' all the happy day.

It's coming, yes, it's coming,
     it's coming down this hour,
A torrent of salvation  
     in saving cleansing pow'r.
I hear the billows surging,
     I see them mount and roll;
Oh glory, hallelujah!
     they're sweeping thro' my soul."
372;Glory To His Name;F;"Down at the cross 
Where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing 
From sin I cried;
There to my heart 
Was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

CHORUS

Glory to His name!
There to my heart 
Was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

I am so wondrously 
Saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly 
Abides within,
There at the cross 
Where He took me in;
Glory to His name!

Oh, precious fountain 
That saves from sin!
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me 
And keeps me clean;
Glory to His name!

Come to this fountain 
So rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul 
At the Savior's feet;
Plunge in today 
And be made complete;
Glory to His name!"
373;It Is Mine;Bb;"God's abiding peace 
Is in my soul today,
Yes, I feel it now,
Yes, I feel it now;
He has taken all my 
Doubts and fears away,
Though I cannot tell you how.

CHORUS
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
He has given peace, 
Perfect peace to me;
It is mine, mine, 
Blessed be His name!
Mine for all eternity!

He has wrought in me 
A sweet and perfect rest,
In my raptured heart 
I can feel it now;
He each passing moment 
Keeps me saved and blest,
Floods with light 
My heart and brow.

He has given me 
A never failing joy,
Oh, I have it now! 
Oh, I have it now!
To His praise I will my 
Ransomed pow'rs employ,
And renew my grateful vow.

Oh, the love of God 
Is comforting my soul,
For His love is mine, 
Yes, His love is mine!
Waves of joy and gladness 
O'er my spirit roll,
Thrilling me with life divine."
374;Builded on the Rock;F;"I builded on the Rock,
On the Rock of God,
Builded on the Rock,Christ Jesus;
I dug down deep 
And builded on the Rock,
Builded on the Rock of God.

Chorus
I hold not the Rock,
But the Rock holds me
The Rock holds me, 
The Rock holds me;
I rest on the Rock,
And the Rock holds me,
Resting on the Rock of God.

Why should I fear 
When the winds sweep by?
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Or shaken be when 
The waves roll high?
Builded on the Rock of God.

Hush, raging billows at His command, 
Builded of the Rock, Christ Jesus;
Oh, peace be still 'neath 
His loving hand!
Builded on the Rock of God.

Praise God for our foundation sure! 
Builded on the Rock, Christ Jesus;
No storms can harm our house secure,
Builded on the Rock of God."
375;At Calvary;C;"Years I spent in vanity 
     and pride,
Caring not my Lord 
     was crucified,
Knowing not it was for 
     me He died
On Calvary.

CHORUS
Mercy there was great, 
     and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied 
     to me;
There my burdened soul 
     found liberty,
At Calvary.

By God's Word at last my 
     sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law 
     I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring 
     turned
To Calvary.

Now I've given to Jesus 
     everything,
Now I gladly own Him as 
     my King,
Now my raptured soul can 
     only sing
Of Calvary.

Oh, the love that drew 
     salvation's plan!
Oh, the grace that brought 
      it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that 
     God did span
At Calvary!"
376;My Burdens Rolled Away;F;"I remember when my burdens 
     rolled away,
I had carried them for years, 
Night and day;
When I sought the blessed Lord, 
And I took Him at His Word,
Then at once all 
My burdens rolled away.

CHORUS
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away;
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since 
My burdens rolled away.

I remember when 
My burdens rolled away,
That I feared would never leave 
Night or day;
Jesus showed to me the loss, 
So I left them at the cross,
I was glad when 
My burdens rolled away.

I am singing since 
My burdens rolled away,
There's a song within my heart 
Night and day;
I am living for my King, 
And with joy I shout and sing
Hallelujah! all 
My burdens rolled away."
377;Bring Them In;F;"Hark, 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who've gone astray
Far from the Shepherd's fold away.

CHORUS
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring the little ones to Jesus.

Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wandering ones to find?
Who'll bring the lost ones the fold,
Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountains wild and high,
Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee,
""Go find My sheep where'er they be."""
378;Jesus Paid It All;Eb;"I hear the Savior say,
""Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.""

CHORUS
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
""Jesus died my soul to save,""
My lips shall still repeat."
379;Friendship With Jesus;C;"A friend of Jesus, oh, what bliss
That one so vile as I
Should ever have a friend 
     like this
To lead me to the sky.

CHORUS
Friendship with Jesus,
Fellowship divine;
Oh, what blessed sweet 
     communion,
Jesus is a friend of mine.

A friend when other friendships 
      cease,
A friend when others fail;
A friend who gives me joy 
     and peace,
A friend when foes assail.

A friend to lead me in the dark,
A friend who knows the way;
A friend to steer my weak, 
     frail bark,
A friend my debts to pay.

A friend when sickness lays 
     me low,
A friend when death draws near;
A friend as through the vale I go,
A friend to help and cheer.

A friend when life's short race 
     is o'er.
A friend when earth is past;
A friend to meet on heaven's 
     shore,
A friend when home at last."

Never fear the storms of sin,

Shout His praises,
For our victory is nigh!
We shall join our 
     conquering Savior,
We shall reign with Him

Well He knows the pathway
     o'er life's burning sands,
Courage, fainting pilgrim,

Where the joys celestial glow,
Oh, there's peace and rest and love,
Where the healing waters flow!

Now with Jesus crucified,
At his feet I'm resting low;
Let me evermore abide
Where the healing waters flow.

Oh, this precious perfect love!
How it keeps the heart aglow,
Streaming from the fount above,
Where the healing waters flow.

Oh, to lean on Jesus' breast,
While the tempests come and go!

Whiter than the driven snow,
Now I sing my sweet refrain,
Where the healing waters flow."

And living here is too.
But if they say that I'd have to 
   choose between the two
I'd go home, I'm going home
Where I belong.

CHORUS
While I'm here I will serve Him gladly
And sing Him all these songs
I'm here, but not for long
When I'm feeling lonely 
And when I'm feeling blue
It's such a joy to know that I am only 
    passing thru
I'm headed home, I'm going home
Where I belong.

Sometimes when I'm dreaming
It comes as no surprise
And if you look and see that 
   homesick feeling in my eyes
I'm going home, I'm going home
Where I belong.

One day if I'm sleeping
When death knocks on my door
And I'll wake to find that I'm not 
    homesick anymore
Cause I'll be home, I'll be home 
Where I belong"

My sheep know my voice
And day by day
They abide in the fold
And go not astray;
They love me because
I have made them my choice
And they follow my call
For my sheep know my voice.

My sheep know my voice
And the pastures of green
Where I lead them so often to feed;
My sheep know my voice and the
     cool sparkling stream
Where beside its still waters I lead.

My sheep know my voice
And the valley of death
Through which I shall lead them

Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.

And lead us where tears never flow.

Come, dear Lord Jesus. 
Thy promise fulfilling;
""Come quickly!"" our souls cry to Thee:
Long has the world been enthralled

By the foot-prints of the Savior,
With His blood He made it,
Made it plain and straight;
If you walk that way,
It will lead you into heaven,
Lead you safely into 
Glory's golden gate.

Sinner, will you come and join

Walk the bloody pathway 
That the Savior trod;

And all the sheaves are garnered,
You will meet the Savior

O hasten and take control!

Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;

Jesus, for our ransom, 
Himself freely gave.

Worthy is the Lamb, 
The bleeding sacrifice 
Who for Adam's race 
Paid such a fearful price;
Worthy is the Lamb, 
The Paschal Lamb of God,
For the world received 
""Redemption thro' His blood.""

""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
Let men and angels sing, 
""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
Let hallelujah's ring ;
And when life is past, 
Upon the golden shore,
""Worthy is the Lamb,"" 
We'll shout forevermore."
396;I Am Thine, Oh Lord;F;"I am Thine, oh Lord, 
    I have heard Thy voice;
And it told Thy love to me.
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

CHORUS
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, 
     nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now, 
    to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up 
    with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour,
That before Thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer, 
    and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love 
    that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy 
    that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee."
397;Blessed Be The Fountain;C;"Blessed be the fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God:
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Though I've wandered far from His fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than the snow,
Whiter than the snow;
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o'ercame;
Grievous were the sorrows he bore,
But He suffered thus not in vain.
May I to that fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below;
Wash me in the blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me-
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."
398;I Need Thee Every Hour;Ab;"I need Thee every hour
Most gracious Lord
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford

CHORUS
I need Thee oh! I need Thee
Every hour I need Thee
Oh bless me now, my Savior
I come to Thee

I need Thee every hour
Stay Thou near by
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh

I need Thee every hour
In joy or pain
Come quickly and abide
Or life is vain

I need Thee every hour
Teach me Thy wil
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfil

I need Thee every hour
Most holy one
Oh, make me Thine indeed
Thou blessed Son"
399;Launch Out;C;"The mercy of God is an ocean divine,
A boundless and fathomless flood;
Launch out in the deep, cut away
     the shoreline,
And be lost in the fullness of God,

Chorus
Launch out into the deep,
Oh, let the shoreline go,
Launch out, launch out in the
     ocean divine,
Out where the full tides flow.

But many, alas! only stand 
    on the shore
And gaze on the ocean so wide;
They never have ventured its 
    depths to explore,
Or to launch on the fathomless tide.

And others just venture away 
    from the land,
And linger so near to the shore,
That the surf and the slime
      that beat over the strand,
Dash o'er them in floods evermore.


Oh,let us launch out on this
     ocean so broad,
Where the floods of salvation e'er flow;
Oh, let us be lost in the mercy of God,
Till the depths of His fullness we know."
400;Pass Me Not;F;"Pass me not, 
O gentle Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others 
Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Chorus
Savior, Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others 
Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Let me at 
Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there 
 in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only
 in Thy merit, 
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded,
 broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the Spring
 of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth
 beside Thee?
Whom in heav'n
 but Thee?"
401;Sunlight, Sunlight;Eb;"I wandered in the shades of night,
Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee.

CHORUS
Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today,
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way;
Since the Savior found,
     took away my sin
I have had the sunlight of His love within.

Tho' clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows 'round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul.

While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigour on,
And leave the world behind.

I cross the wide-extended fields,
I journey o'er the plain,
And in the sunlight of His love
I reap the golden grain.

Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The Light that came to me;
Behold the brightness of His face,
Thro'out eternity."
402;Glory to God, Hallelujah!;Eb;"We are never, never weary
     of the grand old song;

We can sing it loud as ever,
     with our faith more strong;
Glory to God, hallelujah!

CHORUS
Oh the children of the Lord have
     a right to shout and sing,
For the way is growing bright
     and our souls are on the wing,
We are going by and by
     to the palace of a King!
Glory to God, hallelujah!

We are lost amid the rapture
     of redeeming love;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We are rising on its pinions
     to the hills above:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

We are going to a palace
     that is built of gold;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
Where the King in all His splendor
     we shall soon behold:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

There we'll shout redeeming mercy
     in a glad, new song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
There we'll sing the praise of Jesus
     with the blood-washed throng:
Glory to God, hallelujah!"
403;When We All Get to Heaven;Bb;"Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace;
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He'll prepare for us a place.

CHORUS
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will over-spread the sky;
But when trav'ling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev'ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold."
404;What, Never Thirst Again?;Bb;"There flows from Calvary a stream
For every sinner's pain,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never thirst again.

Chorus
What! never thirst again?
No, never thirst again;
What! never thirst again? 
No, never thirst again,
For he that drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

Earth's fountains fair,
But mock our souls,
Like desert phantoms lure,
And they that drink,the fainter grow,
The keener thirst endure.

This stream from Calvary still flows,
To bless and cleanse and heal,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
New life and rest shall feel.

Oh, blessed stream of pure delight! 
Oh, balm for ev'ry pain! 
To thee I haste, for Jesus said,
I'll never thirst again."
405;He Is Able To Deliver Thee;Ab;"'Tis the grandest theme

CHORUS
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

Tho' they are slighting Him,
Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried
That grace can restore:
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken
Will vibrate once more.

Rescue the perishing,
Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor
The Lord will provide:
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand'rer
     a Savior has died."
407;Where He Leads I'll Follow;Eb;"Sweet are the promises,

     and pattern for me

List to His loving words,
     ""Come unto Me!""
Weary, heavy laden,

Lean upon the Savior,

One who can help 
 my burdens to bear;

When the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.

Let us labor for the Master 
From the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous 
Love and care;
Then when all of life is over, 
And our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder,

Of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden's 
     bowers bloom,
By waters still, 
O'er troubled sea,
Still 'tis His hand 
That leadeth me!

Lord, I would clasp 
Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content, whatever lot I see, 
Since 'tis my God

And beyond I see the haven I desire;
There I view the beacon lights of home,
And my soul is burning with the fire."

He's fairer than the lily, 
      brighter than the morning star;
He fills and satisfies
      my longing spirit o'er and o'er;
Each day He grows still sweeter

My Savior stands between;
He stands to shield me from danger,
When earthly friends are gone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

When in affliction's valley
I'm treading the road of care;
My Savior helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet, entangled with briars
Ready to cast me down,
My Savior whispers His promise, 
""I never will leave thee alone.""

He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side;

And Satan tempts me sore,
Through Jesus I shall 
Safely reach the goal;

Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith 
And do His blessed will;

I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He 
My hungry soul shall fill.
Then sweeping up to glory, 
To see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll!"
424;Wonderful Story Of Love;Bb;"Wonderful story of love; 
Tell it to me again;
Wonderful story of love; 
Wake the immortal strain!
Angels with rapture announce it,
Shepherds with wonder receive it;
Sinners, O won't you believe it?
Wonderful story  of love.

CHORUS
Wonderful ! Wonderful! Wonderful!
Wonderful story of love.

Wonderful story of love; 
Tho' you are far away;
Wonderful story of love; 
Still He doth call today;
Calling from Calvary's mountain,
Down from the crystal bright fountain,
E'en from the dawn of creation,
Wonderful story of love.

Wonderful story of love; 
Jesus provides a rest;
Wonderful story of love; 
For all the pure and blest,
Rest in those mansions above us,
With those who've gone on before us,
Singing the rapturous chorus,
Wonderful story of love."
425;The Hallelujah Side;Ab;"Once a sinner far from Jesus, 
I was perishing with cold,
But the blessed Savior 
Heard me when I cried;
Then He threw His robe around me, 
And He led me to His fold,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

CHORUS
Oh, glory be to Jesus, 
Let the hallelujahs roll;
Help me ring the Savior's praises 
     far and wide,
For I've opened up tow'rd heaven 
All the windows of my soul,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Tho' the world may sweep around me
With her dazzle and her dreams,
Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,
For my soul looks up to heaven 
Where the golden sunlight gleams,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Not for all earth's golden millions
Would I leave this precious place,
Tho' the tempter to persuade me 
     oft has tried,
For I'm safe in God's pavilion,
Happy in His love and grace,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Here the sun is always shining,
Here the sky is always bright;
'Tis no place for gloomy 
     Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music 
And my heart with great delight,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

And upon the streets of Glory, 
When we reach the other shore,
And have safely crossed the Jordan's 
     rolling tide,
You will find me shouting ""Glory"" 
Just outside my mansion door,
Where I'm living on the hallelujah side."
426;Onward, Christian Solders;C;"Onward, Christian soldiers! 
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before,
Christ, the royal Master, 
Leads against the foe,
Forward into battle, 
See His banners go!

CHORUS
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.

Like a mighty army 
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading 
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided, 
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never 
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, 
Which can never fail.

At the sign of triumph,
Satan's host doth flee;
On, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise
Brother, lift your voices
Loud your anthems raise!

Onward, then ye people! 
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honor, 
Unto Christ the King;
This thro' countless ages 
Men and angels sing."
427;Victory Ahead;C;"When the hosts of Israel, led by God,
Round the walls of Jericho softly trod;
Trusting in the Lord, they felt the
     conqueror's tread,
By faith they saw the victory ahead.

CHORUS
Victory ahead! Victory ahead!
Through the blood of Jesus, 
     victory ahead;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I hear the conqueror's tread,
By faith I see the victory ahead.

David, with a shepherd's sling 
     and five stones,
Met the giant on the field all alone;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He knew what God had said,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Daniel prayed unto the Lord 
     thrice each day,
Then unto the lion's den led the way;
Trusting in the Lord, 
He did not fear or dread,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Often with the carnal mind I was tried,
Asking for deliverance oft I cried;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I reckoned I was dead,
By faith I saw the victory ahead.

When like those who've gone before 
     to that land,
By death's river cold and dark 
     I shall stand;
Trusting in the Lord, 
I will not fear or dread,
By faith I see the victory ahead."
428;Waiting on the Lord;C;"Waiting on the Lord,

Waiting on the Lord,

Waiting in the upper room.

Chorus
The power! the power!
Gives vict'ry over sin,
     and purity within;
The power! the power!
The pow'r they had at Pentecost.

Waiting on the Lord, 
    giving all to Jesus;
Waiting on the Lord,
     till from sin He frees us;
Waiting on the Lord 
    for the heav'nly breezes;
Waiting in the upper room.

Waiting on the Lord, 
     longing to mount higher;
Waiting on the Lord, 
     having great desire;
Waiting on the Lord 
     for the heav'nly fire;
Waiting in the upper room."
429;Send The Light;F;"There's a call comes ringing 
O'er the restless wave,
Send the light! Send the light!
There are souls to rescue, 
There are souls to save,
Send the light! Send the light!

CHORUS
Send the light, 
The blessed gospel light,
Let it shine from shore to shore!
Send the light, 
And let its radiant beams
Light the world forevermore.

We have heard 
The Macedonian call today
Send the light! Send the light!
And a golden offering 
At the cross we lay,
Send the light! Send the light!

Let us pray that grace 
May everywhere abound,
Send the light! Send the light!
And a Christ-like spirit 
Everywhere be found,
Send the light! Send the light!

Let us not grow weary 
In the work of love,
Send the light! Send the light!
Let us gather jewels 
For a crown above,
Send the light! Send the light!"
430;I'll Go Where You Want Me To Go;Eb;"It may not be on the mountain's height,
Or over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle's front
My Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still, small voice He calls
To paths I do not know,
I'll answer dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I'll go where you want me to go.

Chorus
I'll go where you want me to go , dear Lord
O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord,
I'll be what you want me to be.

Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand'rer whom I should seek,
Oh Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide, 
Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I'll say what you want me to say.

There's surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth's harvest-fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life's short day
For Jesus, the Crucified.
So, trusting my all unto Thy care, 
I know Thou lovest me!
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what you want me to be."
431;Near The Cross;F;"Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

CHORUS
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."
432;Send The Fire;Eb;"Thou Christ of burning, cleansing flame,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
Thy blood bought gift today we claim,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
Look down and see this waiting host,
Give us the promised Holy Ghost,
We want another Pentecost,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

God of Elijah, hear our cry,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
He'll make us fit to live or die,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
To burn up every trace of sin,
To bring the light and glory in,
The revolution now begin,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!

'Tis fire we want, for fire we plead,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!
The fire will meet our every need,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire;
For strength to ever do the right,
For grace to conquer in the fight,
For power to walk in the world in white,
Send the fire, send the fire, send the fire!"
433;Throw Out The Life-Line;F;"Throw out the Life-Line 
Across the dark wave,
There is a brother 
Whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother! 
Oh, who then will dare
To throw out the Life-Line, 
His peril to share?

Chorus
Throw out the Life-Line! 
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is drifting away!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is sinking today.

Throw out the Life-Line 
With hand quick and strong;
Why do you tarry, 
Why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; 
Oh hasten today
And out with the Life-Boat! 
Away, then, away!

Throw out the Life-Line 
To danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish 
Where you've never been;
Winds of temptation 
And billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out 
Where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season 
Of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift 
To eternity's shore;
Haste then,my brother, 
No time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line 
And save them today."
434;Our Lord's Return To Earth Again;F;"I am watching for the coming 
Of the glad millennial day,
When our blessed Lord shall come 
And catch his waiting Bride away;
Oh! my heart is filled with rapture 
As I labor, watch and pray,
For  the Lord is coming back 
     to earth again.

CHORUS
Oh! our Lord is coming back 
     to earth again,
Yes, our Lord is coming back 
     to earth again;
Satan will be bound a thousand years,
We'll have no tempter then,
After Jesus shall come back 
     to earth again.

Jesus' coming back will be the answer
To earth's sorrowing cry,
For the knowledge of the Lord shall fill
The earth and sea and sky;
God shall take away all sickness 
And the sufferer's tears will dry,
When our Savior shall come back 
     to earth again.

Yes, the ransomed of the Lord shall come 
To Zion then with joy,
And in all His holy mountain 
Nothing hurts or shall destroy;
Perfect peace shall reign in every heart,
     and love without alloy,
After Jesus shall come back 
     to earth again.

Then the sin and sorrow, pain and death
     of  this dark world shall cease,
In a glorious reign with Jesus of a
     thousand years of peace;
All the earth is groaning, crying 
For that day of sweet release,
For our Jesus to come back 
     to earth again."

Under the blood, the precious blood,
Under the cleansing, healing flood;
Keep me, Savior, from day to day,
Under the precious blood.

The sinner's refuge here alone,
Under the blood, under the blood;
Here Jesus makes salvation known,
Under the precious blood.

Lord, with Thy self my spirit fill,
Under the blood, under the blood;
And work in me to do Thy will,
Under the precious blood.

Sweet peace abides within the heart,
Under the blood ,under the blood;
And gifts divine their joy impart,
Under the precious blood.

Under the blood, under the blood;
Exerts His sanctifying power,
Under the precious blood."
436;The Message of His Coming;Bb;"We're looking for His coming,
      in the clouds of heaven,
Coming back to earth 
      to catch away His own;
Then may we all be ready, 
      when midnight cry is given,
To go and reign with Christ 
      on His throne.

Chorus
Gladly may we herald the message 
Of His blessed appearing,
Soon He's coming in glory, 
Tell to one and all;
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, 
Why slumber when the end is nearing,
But get ready for the final call.

We're longing for the glory 
     that awaits the faithful,
Who shall overcome, 
     and ev'ry conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward, 
     the prize is life eternal
To all who win the fight over sin.

We're praying for the advent 
      of our blessed Savior,
Who has promised life 
      to all who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending, 
      the message being given,
And soon we'll see our Lord 
      face to face.

We see the signs appearing 
      of His blessed coming,
Lo, behold the fig leaves 
      now becoming green;
The gospel of His kingdom 
      has gone to ev'ry nation;
That we are near the end 
      can be seen."

Jesus' blood can make you free;
For He saved the worst among you,
When He saved a wretch like me.

And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' blood can make the 
     vilest sinner clean.
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' blood can make the 
     vilest sinner clean.

To the faint He giveth power,
Through the mountains makes a way;
Findeth water in the desert,
Turns the night to golden day.

In temptation He is near thee,
Holds the powers of hell at bay;
Guides you to the path of safety,
Gives you grace for every day.

He will keep thee while the ages
Roll throughout eternity;
Though earth hinders and hell rages,
All must work for good to thee."
439;Hiding In Thee;Eb;"Oh safe to the Rock
That is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts
And sorrows would fly;
So sinful, so weary, Thine,
Thine would I be;
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

CHORUS
Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noontide,
In sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation
Casts o'er me its power;
In the tempests of life,
On its wide heaving sea,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict,
When pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and
Breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials
Like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee,
Oh Thou Rock of my soul."
440;My Savior's Love;F;"I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.

CHORUS
How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!

For me it was in the garden
He prayed, ""Not My will, but Thine,""
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me."
441;Tell Me The Old, Old Story;C;"Tell me the old,  old story 
Of unseen things above;
Of Jesus and His glory,

As to a little child,
For I am weak and weary, 
And helpless and defiled.

CHORUS
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story softly, 
That I may take it in,
That wonderful redemption,  
God's remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often, 
For I forget so soon,
The early dew of morning, 
Has passed away at noon.

Tell me the same old story 
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory 
Is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world's glory 
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell  me the old, old story: 
Christ Jesus makes thee whole."

I've anchored to the Rock of Ages.

He keeps my soul from evil 
And gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters 
And bid their tumult cease;
My pilot and deliverer, 
To Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him, 
He's at my side,

He is my Friend and Savior, 
In Him my anchor's cast,
He drives away my sorrows 
And shields me from the blast;
By faith I'm looking upward 
Beyond life's troubled sea,
There I behold a haven 
Prepared for me."

Sing, oh, sing, of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell

I will sing of my  Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be."
445;Let The Lower Lights Be Burning;Ab;"Brightly beams our Father's mercy
From His lighthouse evermore,
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.

CHORUS
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave!
Some poor fainting, struggling sea-man
You may rescue, you may save.

Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;
Some poor sailor tempest tossed,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost."
446;The Sure Foundation;F;"There stands a Rock on shores of time
That rears to heav'n its head sublime;
That Rock is cleft, and they are blest
Who find within this cleft a rest.

Chorus
Some build their hopes on the 
     ever drifting sand,
Some on their fame, or their treasure, 
     or their land;
Mine's on a Rock that forever will stand,
Jesus, the ""Rock of Ages.""

That Rock's a cross, its arms outspread,
Celestial glory bathes its head;
To its firm base my all I bring,
And to the Rock of Ages cling.

That Rock's a tow'r, whose lofty height,
Illum'd with heav'n's unclouded light,
Opes wide its gate beneath the dome
Where saints find rest with Christ at home."

Of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody 
Sweeter than psalm;
In celestial like strains

O'er my soul 
Like an infinite calm.

Coming down from the Father above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray
In fathomless billows of love.

What a treasure I have 
In this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul;
So secure that no power 
Can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll.

I am resting tonight 
In this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus' control;
For I'm kept from all danger 
By night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul.

And me thinks when I rise 
To that city of peace,
Where the author of peace 
I shall see,
That one strain of the song 
Which the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom shall be:

Ah! soul, are you here 
Without comfort or rest,
Marching down the rough 
Pathway of time?
Make Jesus your friend 
Ere the shadows grow dark;
Oh, accept this sweet 
Peace so sublime."

Before the cross I bow, 
    upon the altar lay
A willing offering now, 
    my all from day to day.
My Savior paid the price,  
    my name He sweetly calls;
Upon the sacrifice the fire 
    from heaven falls.

No good that I have done, 
    His promise I embrace;
Accepted in the Son, 
    He saves me by His grace.
All glory be to God! 
    let hallelujahs roll;
His love is shed abroad, 
    the fire is in my soul."

I have blessed peace 
With my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms."

When this fleeting life is over,
Victory, victory.
Sing it here, ye ransomed throng,
Start the everlasting song:
Victory, victory."

I've found it so, 
I've found it so;

The strength to take
The narrow path 
     of righteousness,

In the Bible I see;
This is the dearest 
That Jesus loves me.

CHORUS
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me:
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

Tho' I forget Him 
And wander away,
Still He doth love me 
Wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving 
Arms would I flee,
When I remember 
That Jesus loves me.

Oh, if there's only one 
Song I can sing,
When in His beauty 
I see the  great King,
This shall my song 
In eternity be:
""Oh, what a wonder 
That Jesus loves me.""

Jesus loves me,
And I know I love Him;
Love brought Him down
My poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was love made 
Him die on the tree;
Oh, I am certain that 
Jesus loves me!

If one should ask of me, 
How can I tell?
Glory to Jesus, 
I know very well!
God's Holy Spirit 
With mine doth agree,
Constantly witnessing 
Jesus loves me.

In this assurance 
I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus, 
I know I am blessed;
Satan, dismayed, from my 
Soul now doth flee,
When I just tell him that
Jesus loves me."
453;Beautiful;Bb;"Beautiful robes so white, 
Beautiful land of light,
Beautiful home so bright,
Where there shall come no night;
Beautiful crown I'll wear,
Shining with stars o'er there,
Yonder in mansions fair, 
Gather us there.

Chorus
Beautiful robes, beautiful land, 
Beautiful home, beautiful band,
Beautiful crown, shining so fair,
Beautiful mansion bright,
Gather us there.

Beautiful tho't to me,
We shall forever be 
Thine in eternity,
When from this world we're free;
Free from its toil and care,
Heavenly joys to share,
Let me cross over there;
This is my pray'r.

Beautiful things on high,
Over in yonder sky,
Thus I shall leave this shore,
Counting my treasures o'er;
Where we shall never die,
Carry me by and by,
Never to sorrow more,
Heavenly shore."
454;Sitting At The Feet Of Jesus;F;"Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
O what words I hear him say!
Happy place! so near, so precious!
May it find me there each day;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
I would look upon the past;
For His love has been so gracious,
It has won my heart at last.

Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Where can mortal be more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And, when weary, find sweet rest;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
There I love to weep and pray,
While I from his fullness gather
Grace and comfort every day.

Bless me, oh my Savior, bless me,
As I sit low at Thy feet;
Oh look down in love upon me,
Let me see Thy face so sweet,
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
Make me holy as He is;
May I prove I've been with Jesus,
Who is all my righteousness."
455;The Cleansing Wave;C;"Oh! now I see the crimson wave,
The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save
Points to His wounded side.

CHORUS
The cleansing stream, I see, I see!
I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me!
Oh! praise the Lord, it cleanseth me,
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me!

I see the new creation rise,
I hear the speaking blood,
It speaks! polluted nature dies!
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

I rise to walk in heav'n's own light
Above the world and sin,
With heart made pure, and 
     garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

Amazing grace! 'tis heav'n below
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus know,
My Jesus crucified."
456;Nothing But The Blood;F;"What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

CHORUS
Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

For my cleansing, this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
For my pardon this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Now by this I'll overcome
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Now by this I'll reach my home
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Glory, glory thus I sing
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
All my praise for this I bring,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus"
457;I've Believed The True Report;Ab;"I've believed the true report,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the outer court,
Oh glory be to God!
I am all on Jesus' side,
On the altar sanctified,
To the world and sin I've died,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

CHORUS
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I have passed the riven veil,
Where the glories never fail,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I am living in the presence 
     of the King.

I'm a king and priest to God,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
By the cleansing of the blood,
Oh glory be to God!
By the Spirit's pow'r and light,
I am living day and night,
In the holiest place so bright,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I have passed the outer veil,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
Which did once God's light conceal,
Oh glory be to God!
But the blood has brought me in
To God's holiness so clean,
Where there's death to self and sin,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

I'm within the holiest pale,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the inner veil,
Oh glory be to God!
I am sanctified to God
By the power of the blood,
Now the Lord is my abode,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!"
458;Amazing Grace;F;"Amazing grace! 
     How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, 
     but now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught 
     my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did 
      that grace appear
The hour I first believed;

Thro' many dangers, 
      toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought 
      me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised 
    good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my shield 
    and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh 
    and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, 
    within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The world shall 
     soon to ruin go,
The sun refuse to shine;
But God, who called 
     me here below,
Shall be forever mine.

When we've been 
      there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days 
      to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

Praise God, Praise God
    Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Praise God, 
    Praise God.
Praise God, Praise God
    Praise God, Praise God
Praise God, Praise God,
    Praise God.

Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen.
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen."
459;At The Cross;Eb;"Alas, and did my Savior Bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

CHORUS
At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light,
And the burdens of my heart, 
     rolled away,
It was there by faith, 
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day.

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
Tis all that I can do!"
460;Come Unto Me;C;"Hear the blessed Savior 
     calling the oppressed,
""Oh ye heavy-laden, come 
     to Me and rest;
Come, no longer tarry, 
I your load will bear,
Bring Me ev'ry burden, 
     bring Me ev'ry care.""

Chorus
Come unto Me, 
I will give you rest;
Take My yoke upon you, 
Hear Me and be blest;
I am meek and lowly,
Come and trust My might;
Come, My yoke is easy,
And My burden's light.

Are you disappointed, 
      wand'ring here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt 
      and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle
      in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus, 
He will give you rest.

Stumbling on the mountains 
      dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling tow'rd the pit
      of hell's consuming flame,
By the pow'rs of sin 
      deluded and oppressed, 
Hear the tender Shepherd,
""Come to Me and rest.""

Have you by temptation 
      often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness 
      brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you, 
      if you'll claim His best,
In the Holy Spirit, 
He will give you rest."
461;Where He Leads Me;F;"I can hear my Savior calling,
I can hear my Savior calling,
 I can hear my Savior calling,
""Take thy cross and follow,
     follow Me.""

CHORUS
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him through the garden,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him through the judgment,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
And go with me, with me all the way."
462;I Know Whom I Have Believed;C;"I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

CHORUS
But I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day.

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus thro' the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air."
463;I Believe Jesus Saves;F;"I am coming to Jesus for rest,
Rest, such as the purified know;
My soul is athirst to be blest,
To be washed and made 
     whiter than snow.

CHORUS
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow;
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes 
     whiter than snow.

In coming, my sin I deplore,
My weakness and poverty show;
I long to be saved evermore,
To be washed and made 
     whiter than snow.

To Jesus I give up my all,
Every treasure and idol I know;
For His fullness of blessing I call,
Till His blood washes 
     whiter than snow"
464;Sweet By And By;F;"There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

CHORUS
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days."
465;When I Survey;F;"When I survey the wondrous cross,
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all."
466;The Great Physician;Eb;"The great Physician now is near;
The sympathizing Jesus.
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus.

CHORUS
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

Your many sins are all forgiv'n,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to heav'n,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Savior's name,
I love the name of Jesus.

And when to that bright world above
We rise to be with Jesus,
We'll sing around the throne of love,
His name, the name of Jesus."
468;The Old Account Settled;Ab;"There was a time on earth, 
When in the book of heaven
An old account was standing
For sins yet unforgiven;
My name was at the top, 
And many things below,
I went unto the keeper, 
And settled long ago.

CHORUS
Long ago, long ago, 
Yes the old account 
Was settled long ago;
And the record's clear today, 
For He washed my sins away,
When the old account 
Was settled long ago.

The old account was large, 
And growing every day,
For I was always sinning, 
And never tried to pay;
But when I looked ahead, 
And saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle,
I settled long ago.

When at the judgment bar, 
I stand before my King,
And He the book will open, 
He cannot find a thing;
Then will my heart be glad, 
While tears of joy will flow
Because I had it settled, 
And settled long ago.

When in that happy home, 
My Savior's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story, 
And praise Him for His love;
I'll not forget that book, 
With pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled, 
And settled long ago.

O sinner, seek the Lord, 
Repent of all your sin,
For thus He hath commanded, 
If you would enter in;
And then if you should live 
A hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it, 
You settled long ago."
469;Stand Up For Jesus;G;"Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
ye soldiers of the cross,
Lift high His royal banner, 
it must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory, 
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished 
and Christ is Lord  indeed.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict, 
in this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him, 
against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, 
and strength to strength oppose.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus; 
stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you - 
ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor, 
and watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger, 
be never wanting there."
470;Yesterday, Today, Forever;Ab;"Oh, how sweet the glorious message, 
     simple faith may claim;
Yesterday today, forever,
 Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful, 
     heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest; 
     Glory to His name!

CHORUS
Yesterday, today, forever, 
Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never! 
     Glory to His name,
Glory to His name, Glory to his name;
All may change but Jesus never! 
     Glory to His name.

He who was the friend of sinners, 
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at 
His footstool penitently bow.
He who said, ""I'll not condemn thee, 
     go and sin no more;""
Speaks to thee that word of pardon, 
     as in days of yore.

Oft on earth He healed the sufferer 
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows 
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue, 
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His fullness 
Still will give as much.

As of old He walked to Emmaus, 
      with them to abide;
So through all life's way He walketh, 
      ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him, 
     hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be this same Jesus, 
     as He went away."
471;Revive Us Again;F;"We praise Thee, O God, 
For the Son of Thy love, 
For Jesus who died
And is now gone above.

Chorus
Hallelujah! 
Thine the glory,
Hallelujah! amen; 
Hallelujah!
Thine the glory, 
Revive us again.

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior,
And scattered our night.

All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins
And has cleansed ev'ry stain.

Revive us again;
Fill each heart with Thy love,
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above."
472;Take The Name Of Jesus With You;F;"Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it, then, where'er you go.

CHORUS
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

Take the name of Jesus with you,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

Oh the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven we'll 
    crown Him
When our journey is complete."
473;Jesus Loves Me;C;"Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak but He is strong.

CHORUS
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin.
Let His little child come in.

Jesus loves me! loves me still,
Though I'm very weak and ill;
From His shining throne on high,
Comes to watch me where I lie.

Jesus loves me; He will stay
Close beside me all the way;
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high."
474;Look To The Lamb Of God;F;"If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God;
He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.

CHORUS
Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,
For He alone is able to save you;
Look to the Lamb of God.

When Satan tempts, 
and doubts and fears assail,
Look to the Lamb of God;
You in His strength 
Shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you aweary, 
Does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer 
And fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows 
On your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow 
Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God."
475;Blest Be The Tie That Binds;F;"Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, 
    our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again."
476;Sweet Hour Of Prayer;C;"Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear,
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
I view my home, and take my flight:
This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing thro' the air,
Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"
477;When They Ring The Golden Bells;Eb;"There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore 
By faith's decree;
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

CHORUS
Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee.
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

We shall know no sin nor sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond
    the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
When in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the spirit
    to be free
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Aiden,
When they ring the golden bells
    for you and me."
478;Jesus, Lover Of My Soul;F;"Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high!
Hide me, oh my Savior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:
Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me!
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, oh Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
False and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace."
479;Joy To The World!;C;"Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.

Joy to the world! the Savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills
    and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, and wonders of His love."

Born to give them second birth.

Come, Desire of nations, come!
Fix in us Thy humble home:
Rise, the woman's conqu'ring seed,

Adam's likeness now efface,
Stamp Thine image in its place:
Second Adam from above,
Reinstate us in Thy love."

Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia,
Christ, the Savour is born!
Chrst, the Savour, is born!

Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn or redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth.
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth."
483;Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem;Eb;"Oh little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by:
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary;
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Oh holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend on us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today.
We hear the holy angels
The great glad tidings tell;
Oh come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel."
484;It Came Upon The Midnight Clear;Bb;"It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
From heaven's all-gracious King:""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still thro' the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
Oh rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing.

For lo, the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the evercircling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing."
485;Away In A Manger;F;"Away in a manger,
No crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus,
Asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing,
The Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
No crying He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle,
Till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever,
And love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And take us to heaven,
To live with Thee there."

There's no other way but His way;

Do you not feel, dear brother,
His Spirit now striving within?
Oh, why not accept His salvation,
And throw off your burden of sin?

Why do you wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Savior is longing to bless you;
There's danger and death in delay."

Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,

Abide in thy soul?

640;BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY;G;"Have you been baptized into 
    the Body?
Baptized with the Holy Ghost;
There is but one way to enter
      in it,
Just as they did on Pentecost.

chorus
Are you in the Church 
    triumphant?
Are you in the Saviour's Bride?
Come and be baptized into 
    the Body,
And forevermore abide.

There is but one Church, 
    Bride or Body,
And into it we're all baptized;
By the one, true, promised 
     Holy Spirit;
Though by the world we're 
     all despised.

Every creed has claimed to be 
     the Body,
But the ""plumb line"" proved 
    untrue
All their dreams, for God has so 
     determined
To bring His Son's true Bride 
      to view.

Many thought that they were in 
    the Body,
'Till the Holy Ghost had come;
When the Word of God was o
     pened to them,
They entered in, and yet 
      there's room.

Those who died before the 
    Holy Spirit
Came upon us from on high,
May, by faith with Saints of 
    old departed,
Arise to meet Him in the sky.

When the Bridegroom comes, 
     will you be ready;
And your vessel all filled and 
       bright?
You will be among the foolish 
      virgins
If you do not walk in the light."

Never molested though in the 
     wrong.

CHORUS
Farther along we'll know all 
     about it,
Farther along we'll understand 
      why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in 
        the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.

When death has come and 
     taken our loved ones,
It leaves our home so lonely 
     and drear;
Then do we wonder why 
       others prosper,
Living so wicked year after year.

Faithful till death said our 
     loving Master,
A few more days to labor 
      and wait;
Toils of the road will then seem 
      as nothing,
As we sweep through the beautiful 
     gate.

When we see Jesus coming in glory,
When He comes from His home 
      in the sky;
Then we shall meet Him in that 
     bright mansion,
We'll understand it all by and by."

Yes, we'll labor far and near, never

We will sing and we will pray, and 
      our Master's voice obey,

O who will come and

O'er all those wide 
     extended plains

There God the Son

And scatters night away.

No chilling winds, nor
     pois'nous breath, 
Can reach that healthful
       shore; 
Sickness and sorrow,

     sorrow have blown;
There'll be somebody waiting 
      to show me the way,
I won't have to cross Jordan
       alone.

CHORUS
I won't have to cross Jordan 
    alone,
Jesus died all my sins 
    to atone;
When the darkness I see, 
    He'll be waiting for me,
I won't have to cross Jordan 
    alone.

Oftentimes I'm forsaken, and 
    weary and sad,
When it seems that my friends 
    have all gone;
There is one thought that cheers 
    me and makes my heart glad,
I won't have to cross Jordan 
     alone.

Though the billows of sorrow 
  and  trouble may sweep,
Christ the Saviour will care for 
      His own;
Till the end of the journey, my 
      soul He will keep,
I won't have to cross Jordan 
    alone"
648;I'D RATHER BE AN OLDTIME CHRISTIAN;Eb;"In this world I've tried most everything,
And I'm happy now to say
There is nothing like religion
In the good old-fashioned way;
I am walking in the old-time way,
And I want the world to know
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

CHORUS
I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know,
There's nothing like an old-time  Christian
With a Christian love to show;
I'm walking in the grand old highway,
And I'm telling everywhere I go,
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

There are many things I'd like to be
As my journey I pursue,
I have longed to be a leader
Like a mortal man would do;
I would like to be a millionaire,
With a million to bestow,
But I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

All the world is bright since I got right,
Now I sing and pray and shout,
All my burdens have been lifted
Since the Saviour brought me out;
I will tell the world both far and near
As I travel here below,
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know."
649;I'LL BE LISTENING;Ab;"When the Saviour calls I
     will answer,
When He calls for me I will 
     hear;
When the Saviour calls I 
    will answer,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
    for my name.

CHORUS
I'll   be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
    for my name;
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
    for my name.

If my heart is right when He
     calls me, 
If my heart is right I will hear
If my heart is right when He
    calls me, 
I'll be somewhere list'ning 
    for my name.

If my robe is white when He 
    calls me, 
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white when He
    calls Me. 
I'll be. somewhere list'ning 
    for my name."
650;I'LL MEET YOU;Eb;"I will meet you in the morning, by t
      he bright river side,
When all sorrow has drifted away;
I'll be standing at the portals, when
      the gates open wide,
At the close of life's long, dreary day.

CHORUS
I'll meet you in the morning with a
    ""How do you do,""
And we'll sit down by the river and 
   with rapture ""auld"" acquaintance
    renew, 
You'll know me in the morning, by 
   the smiles that I wear,
When I meet you in the morning, in 
    the city that is built foursquare.

I will meet you in the morning, in the
    sweet by and by,
And exchange the old cross for 
    a crown; 
There will be no disappointments and
      nobody shall die,
In that land, e'er the sun goeth down.

I will meet you in the morning, at the 
    end of the way,
On the streets of that city of gold; 
Where we all can be together and be 
    happy for aye,
While the years and the ages shall roll."
651;IT SHALL FLOW LIKE A RIVER;C;"It shall flow like a river, It 
   shall fall like the rain,
It shall rise as the dew in 
   morning o'er the plain;
For the knowledge of the 
     Lord shall fill all the earth
When the Spirit of the Lord 
    shall fall.

Flow, river, flow; flow, river, flow;
Flow out through the nations 	
    wherever man may go;
Cause life to spring forth, that 
    all men may know
That You're the river of the Spirit; 
    Oh, flow, river, flow."
652;JUST A CLOSER WALK;C;"I am weak but Thou
    art strong,
Jesus keep me from 
    all wrong;
I'll be satisfied as long,
As I walk let me walk 
    close to Thee.

Chorus
Just a closer walk with 
    Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my 
   plea;
Daily walking close to 
   Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let
    it be.

Thru this world of toil 
   and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me myburden 
    hares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, 
   none but Thee.

When my feeble life is o'er,
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o'er,
To Thy kingdom shore, to 
   Thy shore."
653;LIFT HIM UP;Ab;"How to reach the masses,
    men of every birth?
For an answer Jesus gave 
    a key
""And I, if I be lifted up 
     from the earth, 
Will draw all men unto me.""

CHORUS
Lift Him up, lift Him up,
Still He speaks from eternity,
""And I, if I be lifted up from 
    the earth,
 Will draw all men unto me.""

0 the world is hungry for the 
     living bread,
Lift the Saviour up for them
    to see; 
Trust Him, and do not doubt 
    the words that He said,
""I'll draw all men unto me.""

Don't exalt the preacher, 
    don't exalt the pew.
Preach the Gospel simple, 
     full and free; 
Prove Him and you will find
       that promise is true,
""I'll draw all men unto me.""

Lift Him up by living as a 
    Christian ought,
Let the world in you the 
    Saviour see, 
Then men will gladly follow 
     Him, who once taught,
""I'll draw all men unto me."""
654;NO DISAPPOINTMENT;Eb;"There's no disappointment in heaven,
No weariness, sorrow or pain;
No hearts that are bleeding and broken,
No song with a minor refrain.
The clouds of our earthly horizon
Will never appear in the sky,
For all will be sunshine and gladness,
With never a sob nor a sigh.

CHORUS
I'm bound for that beautiful city
My Lord has prepared for His own;
Where all the redeemed of all ages
Sing ""Glory!"" around the white throne',
Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven,
And the glories I there shall behold:
What a joy that will be when my Saviour
I see,
In that beautiful city of gold!

We'll never pay rent for our mansion,
The taxes will never come due:
Our garments will never grow threadbare,
But always be fadeless and new.
We'll never be hungry nor thirsty,
Nor languish in poverty there,
For all the rich bounties of heaven
His sanctified children will share.

There'll never be crape on the doorknob,
No funeral train in the sky;
No graves on the hillsides of glory,
For there we shall nevermore die.
The old will be young there forever,
Transformed in a moment of time;
Immortal we'll stand in His likeness,
The stars and the sun to outshine."
655;PAST THE CURTAIN OF TIME;Eb;"There's a curtain that's drawn 
   between earth and Heaven,
And just beyond lies a beautiful 
   clime 
Where the evils of this life no
    longer can touch me;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
    of time.

CHORUS

Lord, let me. look Past the curtain 
    of sorrows and fear,
Let me view that sunny bright clime;
It would strengthen my faith and 
    would banish all fear;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
   of time.

I'm helpless, alone, and I want to 
    see Jesus,
And hear the sweet harbor bells
    chime, 
Where, my friends and dear loved
     ones are waiting for me;
Lord, let me look past the curtain 
   of time.

I'm so homesick and blue, and I 
    want to see Jesus,
I would like to hear those sweet 
     harbor bells chime;
It would brighten my Path and 
    would vanish all fear;
Lord. let me look past the curtain 
   of time."
656;PRECIOUS MEMORIES;Ab;"Precious memories, unseen 
    angels,
Sent from somewhere to 
     my soul;
How they linger, ever near
    me,
And the sacred past untold.

CHORUS
Precious memories, how
   they linger,
How they ever flood 
   my soul;
In the stillness of the 
   midnight,
Precious, sacred scenes
    unfold.

Precious father, loving 
   mother,
Fly across the lonely years;
And old home scenes of
    my childhood,
In fond memory appear.

In the stillness of the
   midnight,
Echoes from the past 
   I hear;
Old-time singing, 
   gladness bringing,
From that lovely land 
   somewhere.

As I travel on life's 
   pathway,
Know not what the 
   years may hold;
As I ponder, hope 
  grows fonder,
Precious memories
    flood my soul.

Precious memories of 
  the prophet,
Flood my soul from day 
   to day,
I remember scenes so
    precious
That can never pass 
   away.

I've heard the Message 
   and Its signal
That day's end is near 
   at hand,
But I remember that He 
   promised
He'd return for those 
    who'd stand.

Precious memories, 
    glorious meetings
Across this land from 
   sea to sea
Where I heard the
    prophet's Message
That brought Life and
   hope to me.

Precious memories in
   this storehouse
Where the Food was
    laid away,
We've returned to where 
    he stored It,
Spiritual Food against this 
  day."
657;ROOM AT THE FOUNTAIN;Eb;"I heard my loving Savior 
   say,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee,
Come, wash the stains 
     of sin away,
There's room at the 
     fountain for thee.

chorus
Room, room, yes, there 
   is room,
Room at the fountain 
    for thee;
Room, room, yes, there
     is room,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

I came to Him, my sins 
    confessed,
There was room at the 
    fountain for me;
When I gave up, my heart 
    was blest,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

I plunged beneath the
    crimson tide,
There was room at the 
     fountain for me;
And now by faith am 
      sanctified,
There's room at the 
      fountain for thee.

I found the crimson 
    stream I know,
There was room at the
    fountain for me;
His blood has washed 
    me white as snow,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

He cleansed my heart 
   from inbred sin,
There was room at the 
    fountain for me;
And now He keeps me
    pure within,
There's room at the 
   fountain for thee,

I'll praise Him while He
    gives me breath,
There was room at the 
    fountain for me;
He saved me from an 
    awful death,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

His blood was shed 
  but once for all,
There was room at the 
   fountain for me;
Oh, don't reject sweet 
   Merey's call,
There's room at the 
    fountain for thee.

We'll sing with all the
     saints above,
There was room at the 
    fountain for me;
And praise Him for 
    redeeming love,
There's room at the fountain for thee."
658;THE CLOUD AND FIRE;Eb;"As of old, when the hosts  of Israel 
Were compelled in the  wilderness 
   to dwell,
Trusting they in their God 
     to lead the way
To the light of perfect day.

CHORUS
So the sign of the fire by night,
And the sign of the cloud by day,
Hovering o'er, just before,
As they journey on their way,
Shall a guide and a leader be,
Till the wilderness be past,
For the Lord, our God, in His 
    own good time
Shall lead to the light at last.

To and fro, as a ship without 
  a sail, 
Not a compass to guide them
     through the vale,
But the sign of their God was 
     ever near, 
Thus their fainting hearts 
    to cheer.

All the days of their wanderings 
   they were fed,
To the land of the promise they 
    were led;
By the hand of the Lord in 
   guidance sure,
They were brought to Canaan's 
    shore."
659;THE EASTERN GATE;Ab;"I will meet you in the morning,
Just inside the Eastern Gate,
Then be ready, faithful pilgrim,
Lest with you it be too late.

CHORUS
I will meet you, I will meet you 
Just inside the Eastern Gate 
   over there; 
I will meet you, I will meet you, 
I will meet you in the morning 
    over there.

If you hasten off to glory,
Linger near the Eastern Gate.,
For I'm coming in the morning,
So you'll not have long to wait.

Keep your lamps all trimmed 
    and burning,
For the Bridegroom watch 
    and wait, 
He'll be with us at the meeting, 
Just inside the Eastern Gate.

O the joys of that glad meeting
With the saints who for us wait, 
What a blessed, happy meeting,
Just inside the Eastern Gate."
660;THE END TIME;F;"I look and see earth's 
   sorrowing picture, 
The hoarding mobs for 
   selfish gain; 
Their toil of hand for ease 
   and comforts 
Can they not see, their doom 
    is sealed, it's all in vain.

CHORUS
The end is here, it's now at 
   hand,
The Bride is gathering; the 
   world is failing;
Israel's awak'ning; nations 
  are  breaking;
Our prophet taught us, we 
   believe the end is here.

Sirs, this is the time! our 
   prophet spoke of,
The Angel came with a 
   Shout,
The mountain shook as 
   His Voice cried out,
""Time is no more,"" loud and 
   clear the Shout went forth,

Have you considered the 
    end-time Message?
Have you considered 
     Malachi 4?
Revelation 10:7 and 
    St. Luke 17 
Proclaims this Message now, 
    and then forevermore."
661;THE GREAT I AM;Ab;"I AM that spoke to Moses in 
     the burning bush of fire
I AM the God of Abraham, the
      Bright and Morning Star.
I AM the Rose of Sharon, from 
     beginning whence 1 came;
I AM the whole creation, and 
    Jesus is My Name.

CHORUS
Oh, who do you say I am, and 
    whence do you say I came,
Do you know the Father, and 
     can you tell His Name?
In Jesus dwells the fullness of 
     the Godhead, don't you see;
Jesus is the great I AM, and the 
     Lord of lords is He.

I AM was before old Abraham, 
   ""He rejoiced to see MY day."" .
When Jesus spoke these 
   precious  words, they stoned 
       Him right away.  
""Why do you stone Me?"" Jesus 
   said, in a holy, sweet command.
""Because you say you're the 
     great I AM, we believe you're
         just a man  

It was on the Day of Pentecost, 
     oh, how the fire did fall;
The Holy Ghost descended 
    and filled them one and all.
Then Peter told the multitude, 
   ""Repent of all your sins.""
About three thousand souls
     were buried in Jesus' 
        precious Name."
662;THE GREAT JUDGMENT;C;"I dreamed that the great judgment morning
Had dawned, and the trumpet had blown;
I dreamed that the nations had gathered
To judgment before the white throne;
From the throne came a bright shining angel,
And stood on the land and the sea,
And swore with his hand raised to heaven,
That time was no longer to be.

And O, what a weeping and wailing,
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
They prayed, but their prayers were too late.

The rich man was there, but his money
Had melted and vanished away;
A pauper he stood in the judgment,
His debts were too heavy to pay;
The great man was there, but his greatness,
When death came, was left far behind.
The angel that opened the records,
Not a trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there with the orphans.,
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven forever,
God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
The gambler was there and the drunkard,
And the man that had sold them the drink,
With the people who gave him the license,
Together in hell they did sink.

The moral man came to the judgments,
But his self-righteous rags would not do;
The men who had crucified Jesus
Had passed off as moral men, too;
The soul that had put off salvation,
""Not tonight; I'll get saved by and by,
No time now to think of, religion!""
At last they had found time to die."
664;THE PEARLY WHITE CITY;Eb;"There's a holy and beautiful city,
Whose builder and ruler is God.
John saw it descending from heaven
When Patmos, in exile, he trod;
Its high, massive wall is of jasper,
The City itself is pure gold;
And when my frail tent here is folded,
Mine eyes shall its glory behold.

chorus
In that bright city', pearly white city,
I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown;
Now I am watching, waiting and longing,
For the white city John saw coming down.

No sin is allowed in that city,
And nothing defiling nor mean;
No pain and no sickness can enter,
No crape on the doorknob is seen;
Earth's sorrows and cares are forgotten,
No tempter is there to annoy;
No parting words ever are spoken,
There's nothing to hurt and destroy.

No heartaches are known in that city,
No tears ever moisten the eye,
There's no disappointment in heaven,
No envy and strife in the sky;
The saints are all sanctified wholly,
They live in sweet harmony there;
My heart is now set on that city,
And some day its blessings I'll share.

My loved ones are gathering yonder,
My friends, too, are passing away;
And soon I shall join their bright number,
And dwell in eternity's day;
They're safe now in glory with Jesus,
Their trials and battles are past;
They overcome sin and the tempter,
They've reached that fair city at last."
665;THE SHEEP OF HIS PASTURE;F;"The sheep of His pasture 
    have gathered
To hear what the 
    Shepherd would say,
His voice like the sound 
     of slow waters,
Came rippling through 
     vessels of clay.

'Tis the voice that brought 
    forth creation
And set all the stars in 
    array,
And speaks words of Life 
    and of wisdom,
In the midst of His people 
    today.

Through prophets, by 
  precious blood purchased,
Cleansed and surrendered 
    and filled.
And set in the Body for 
   service,
As the Head of the Body 
    hath willed."
666;THE SUN, NEVER GO DOWN;F;"The sun, it will never go 
   down, in that city,
The sun, it will never go
     down;
The flowers are blooming
     forever,
And the sun, it will never 
      go down.

I feel like travelling on, 
    I do,
I feel like travelling on;
The flowers are blooming 
     forever,
And the sun, it will never 
    go down.

I feel like shouting, 
    sometimes I do,
I feel like shouting, 
    I do;
The flowers are 
     blooming forever,
And the sun, it will never 
   go down."
667;THERE'S A GREAT DAY COMING;G;"There's a great day coming, 
     a great day coming,
There's a great day coming 
     by and by, 
When the saints and the 
     sinners shall be parted
       right and left,
Are you ready for that day
      to come?.

CHORUS
Are you ready? are you 
    ready?
Are you ready for the 
    judgment day?
Are you ready? are you
     ready?
For the judgment day?

There's a bright day coming, 
    a bright day coming,
There's a bright day coming 
    by and by, 
But its brightness shall only 
    come to them that love 
     the Lord,
Are you ready for that day to 
     come?

There's a sad day coming, a 
     sad day coming,
There's a sad day coming by
     and by, 
When the sinner shall hear 
     his doom,""Depart, I know 
     ye not,""
Are you ready for that day to 
   come?"
668;THEY COME;Eb;"They come from the East and West,
They come from the lands afar,
To feast with the King, to dine as His guest;
How blessed these pilgrims are!
Beholding His hallowed face
Aglow with light divine;
Blest partakers of His grace,
As gems in His crown to shine.


CHORUS
Since Jesus has set me free,
I'm happy as heart can be;
No longer I bear the burden of care,
His yoke is so sweet to me.
My soul was as black as night,
But darkness has taken flight;
Now I shout the victory,
For Jesus has set me free.


I look on the great white throne,
Before it the ransom'd stand;
No longer are tears, no sorrow is known
Nor death in that goodly land.
My Saviour has gone before,
Preparing the way for me;
Soon we'll meet to part no more
Thru time or eternity.


The gates of that holy place
Stand open by night and day;
O look to the Lord who ""giveth more grace,""
Whose love has prepared the way.
A home in those mansions fair
His hand hath reserved for all.
For the wedding feast prepare,
Obeying the gracious call.


Oh, Jesus is coming soon,
Our trials will then be o'er.
What if our Lord this moment should come
For those who are free from sin?
Then would it bring you joy,
Or sorrow and deep despair?
When our Lord in glory comes,
We'll meet Him up in the air."
669;WATCHING YOU;F;"All along on the road to the 
    souls true abode,
There's an Eye watching
    you;
Every step that you take, 
    this great Eye is awake,
There's an Eye watching
     you.

CHORUS
Watching you, watching 
  you,
Every day mind the 
   course you pursue;
Watching you, watching
    you,
There's an all-seeing 
    Eye watching you.

As you make life's great
    flight, keep the pathway 
     of right,
There's an Eye watching 
    you;
God will warn not to go in 
    the path of the foe,
There's an Eye watching 
    you.

Fix your mind on the goal,
     that sweet home of the
      soul,
There's an Eye watching 
      you;
Never turn from the way 
    to the kingdom of day,
There's an Eye watching 
      you.

If you steal and cheat and lie
And in the church you testify
There's an Eye, watching you
Every step that you take this 
Great eye is awake
There's an Eye watching you"
670;WEAR A CROWN;Ab;"Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His Name?

CHORUS
And when the battle's over, 
   we shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown!
     Yes, we shall wear a crown!
And when the battle's over, 
     we shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.
Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown.
And when the battle's over, 
    we shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

Must I be carried to the skies
On flow'ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God'.'

Sure I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord;
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain.
Supported by Thy Word,"
671;WHEN WE SEE CHRIST;Eb;"Oft times the day seems long, 
    our trials hard to bear;
We're tempted to complain, 
    to murmur and despair;
But Christ will soon appear. 
     to catch His bride away,
All tears forever over, in 
     God's eternal day.

CHORUS
It will be worth it all, when 
    we see Jesus; 
Life's trials will seem so small, 
   when we see Christ;
One glimpse of His dear face, 
   all sorrow will erase,
So bravely run the race till 
    we see Christ.

Sometimes the sky looks dark, 
   with not a ray of light;
We're tossed and driven on, 
   no human help in sight;
But there is One in heaven, 
     who knows our deepest
      care,
Let Jesus solve your problem, 
     just go to Him in prayer

Life's day will soon be o'er, 
    all storms forever past;
We'll cross the great divide, 
     to glory safe at last;
We'll share the joys of heaven, 
     a harp, a home, a crown;
The tempter will be banished, 
     we'll lay our burden down."
672;WHERE COULD I GO?;G;"Living below in this old 
   sinful world,
Hardly a comfort can 
   afford;
Striving alone to face
     temptations sore,
Where could I go but 
    to the Lord?

CHORUS
Where could I go, O
    where could I go?
Seeking a refuge for 
    my soul?
I Needing a friend to 
    help me in the end,
Where could I go but 
    to the Lord?

Neighbours are kind, I 
   love them every one,
We get along in sweet 
   accord;
But when my soul needs
     manna from above,
Where could I go but to
    the Lord?

Life here is grand with
   friends I love so dear,
Comfort I get from God's 
   own word; 
Yet when I face the 
    chilling hand of death,
Where could I go but to 
    the Lord?"
673;WHERE WE NEVER GROW OLD;Eb;"I have heard of a land on 
   the far away strand,
'Tis a beautiful home of 
    the soul;
Built by Jesus on high, 
    there we never shall die,
'Tis a land where we never 
    grow old.

CHORUS
Never grow old, never grow 
   old,
In a land where we'll never 
    grow old;
Never grow old, never grow 
   old,
In a land where we'll never
     grow old.

In that beautiful home where 
    we'll nevermore roam,
We shall be in the sweet by 
   and by; 
Happy praise to the King, 
   through eternity sing,
'Tis a land where we never 
    shall die.

When our work here is done 
     and the life-crown is won,
And our troubles and trials are 
    e'er,
All our sorrow will end, and our 
    voices will blend,
With the loved ones who've 
    gone on before."
674;WHITER THAN THE SNOW;Eb;"Blessed be the Fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God;
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Thou I've wandered far from His fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than the snow!
Whiter than the snow!
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that Fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."
675;THE FIGHT IS ON;C;"The fight is on, the trumpet sound 
    is ringing out,
The cry ""To arms"" is heard afar 
     and near;
The Lord of hosts is marching on 
       to victory,
The triumph of the right will soon 
       appear.

CHORUS
The fight is on, O Christian soldiers,
And face to face in stern array
With armor gleaming, and colors 
     streaming,
The right and wrong engage today;
The fight is on, but be not weary,
Be strong and in his might hold fast;
If God be for us, his banner o'er us,
We'll sing the victor's song at last.

The fight is on, arouse ye soldiers
      brave and true,
Jehovah leads, and vict'ry will 
      assure;
Go buckle on the armor God has
       given you,
And in His strength unto the end 
       endure.

The Lord is leading on to certain 
     victory,
The bow of promise spans the 
       eastern sky;
His glorious name in every land 
      shall honored be,
The morn will break, the dawn of 
      peace is nigh."

And the more I long that others
Should be led to know Him too.

He is not a disappointment !
He has saved my soul from sin:
All the guilt and all the anguish,
Which oppressed my heart within,
He has banished by His presence,
And His blessed kiss of peace
Has assured my heart forever
That his love will never cease.

He is not a  disappointment !
He has healed my body too:
What a tender, mighty Saviour,
There is naught He cannot do !
When on earth He healed diseases
As they touched Him in the throng;
Has he lost His heart of pity ?
Is the risen Christ less strong ?

He is not a  disappointment !
He is coming by and by,
In my heart I have the witness
That His coming draweth nigh.
All the scoffers may despise me,
But He tells me He is coming, 
And no change around may see,
And that's quite enough for me.

He is not a disappointment!
He is all in all to me-
Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer;
The unchanging Christ is He!
He has won my heart's affections,
And He meets my every need;
He is not a disappointment,
For He satisfies indeed."

792;WONDERFULL;;"O my heart sings today, sings
     for joy and gladness,
Jesus saves, satisfies, 
     banishes my sadness;
Guilt is gone, peace is mine 
     peace like to a river,
Jesus is wonderful, mighty to 
    deliver.

CHORUS
Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus 
    is to me,
Counselor, Prince of Peace, 
     Mighty God is He;
Saving me, keeping me from all 
    sin and shame,
Wonderful is my Redeemer, 
     praise His name

Once a slave, now I'm free, 
    free from condemnation,
Jesus gives liberty and a full
      salvation;
Now the sins of the past have 
     been all forgiven,
And my name is inscribed on the
      book of heaven.

Living here with my Lord in a 
   Holy union,
Day by day, all the way holding
     sweet communion;
O what change grace hath 
     wrought in my lowly station!
Since my soul has received full 
    and free salvation."

797;BY AND BY, MORNING COMES;;"We are often tossed and driven on the
Restless sea of time,
Somber skies and howling tempests oft
Succeed a bright sunshine;
In that land of perfect day, when the
Mists have rolled away,
We will understand it better by and by.

CHORUS
By and by when the morning comes,
When all the saints of God are gathered 
    home,
We will tell the story how we overcome,
For we'll understand it better by and by.

We are often destitutes of the things that 
    life demands,
Want of food and want of shelter, thirsty 
Hills and barren lands;
But we're trusting in the Lord, and 
According to His Word,
We will understand it better by and by.

Trials dark on every hand, and we 
    cannot understand,
All the ways that God would lead us to
That blessed Promised Land;
But He guides us with his eye and we'll
Follow till we die,
For we'll understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares often take
     us unawares,
And our hearts are made to bleed for
Many a thoughtless word or deed,
And we wonder why the test when we
Try to do our best,
But we'll understand it better by and by."
798;COME AND DINE;;"Jesus has a table spread where 
  the saints  Of God are fed,
He invites His chosen people 
   ""Come and dine;""
With His manna He doth feed and 
Supplies our every need;
O, 'tis sweet to sup with Jesus all
    the time!

CHORUS
""Come and dine,"" the Master calleth,
""Come and dine;""
You may feast at Jesus table all 
   the time;
He who fed the multitude, turned the
Water into wine,
To the hungry calleth now, ""Come
   and dine.""

The disciples came to land, thus 
   obeying Christ's command,
For the master called to them, 
    ""Come and dine;""
There they found their hearts' 
   desire,
Bread and fish upon the fire;
Thus he satisfies the hungry all 
   the time.

Soon the Lamb will take His bride 
   to Be ever at His side,
All the host of heaven will 
    assembled be;
O,'twill be a glorious sight, all the 
    saints in spotless white;
And with Jesus they will feast
     eternally."
799;DON'T FORGET PRAYER;;"Don't forget the family prayer,
Jesus wants to meet you there;
He will take your every care,
Oh, don't forget the family prayer."
800;STAND ON THAT ROCK;;"Crying ""Holy"" unto the Lord,
Crying ""Holy"" unto the Lord,
If I could, I surely would
Stand on that rock where 
   Moses stood."
801;EACH STEP OF THE WAY;;"I'm following Jesus,
One step at a time;
I live for the moment,
In His love devine.
Why think of tomorrow,
Just live for today;
I'm following Jesus,
Each step of the way.

The pathway is narrow,
But He leads me on;
I walk in His shadow,
My fears are all gone.
My spirit grows stronger,
Each moment, each day,
For Jesus is leading 
Each step of the way."
802;GET ON BOARD;;"It's the old ship of Zion,
It's the old ship of Zion,
It's the old ship of Zion,
Get on board, get on board.

It has landed my old father,
It has landed my old father,
It has landed my old father,
Get on board, get on board."
803;HE'S COMING AGAIN;;"Would you be numbered as
     one of His fold?
Would you be numbered as 
      one of His fold?
Be spotless within, be 
     watching and
Waiting that sight to behold;
He's coming again."
805;I'M GOING THROUGH;;"Lord, I have started to walk
     in the light,
Shining upon me from 
    heaven so bright,
I bade the world and its
     follies adieu,
I've started in Jesus and 
    I'm going through.

CHORUS
I'm going through, yes,
     I'm going through,
I'll pay the price whatever
      others do,
I'll take the way with the 
    Lord's despised few,
I'm going through, Jesus, 
    I'm going through.

Oh there are many who 
   start in the race,
But with the light refuse
     to keep pace,
Others accept it because
     it is new,
But not very many expect 
     to go through.

I'd rather walk with Jesus
     alone,
Have for a pillow, like Jacob, 
    a stone;
Living each moment with His
    face in view,
Than shrink from my pathway 
    and fail to go through.

O brother, now will you take 
    up the cross?
Give up the world and count
      it as dross;
Sell all thou hast and give to 
    the poor,
Then go through with Jesus and 
    those who endure."
806;I'M OVERCOMING;;"I'm overcoming, I'm 
  overcoming,
I'm overcoming, I'm 
  overcoming,
For I love Jesus, He's 
   my Saviour,
And He smiles and He 
   loves me too."
807;IN THAT CITY, LAMB IS LIGHT;;"There's a country far beyond 
   the starry sky;
There's a city where there 
    never comes a night;
If we're faithful we shall go 
    there by and by,
It's the city where the Lamp 
    is the light.

CHORUS
In that city where the Lamb
   is the light,
The city where there cometh
    no night;
I've a mansion over there, 
   and when free
From toil and care,
I am going where the Lamb 
   is the light.

Here we have our days of 
   sunshine, but we know
That the sun which shines 
     upon us now so bright
Will be changed to clouds and 
    rain until we go
To that city where the Lamb 
    is the light.

There the flowers bloom 
    forever and the day
Shall be one eternal day 
    without a night;
And our tears shall be forever
     wiped away,
In that city where the Lamb 
     is the light.

Here we have our disappointments 
      all the while,
And our fondest hopes but meet 
    with bitter blight;
Though by night we weep, the 
    morning brings a smile, 
In that city where the Lamb is the 
     light.

Then let sunshine fade, let twilight
     bring its gloom,
Not a shadow can my blissful 
     soul affright;
For I know that up in heaven 
     there is room,
In that city where the Lamb is
     the light."
808;LOVE LIFTED ME;;"I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more;
But the Master of the sea
Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
Now safe am I

CHORUS
Love lifted me! Love lifted 
   me!
When nothing else could 
     help, love lifted me,
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could 
     help, love lifted me.

All my heart to him I give,
Ever to Him I'll cling,
In his blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing,
Love so might and so true
Merits my soul's best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To him belongs.

Souls in danger, look above,
Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by his love
Out of the angry waves.
He's the Master of the sea,
Billows His will obey;
He your Saviour wants to be;
Be saved today."
809;OH, THAT MAN FROM GALILEE.;;"In a manger long ago, I
     know it's really so,
A Babe was born to save
     men from their sin.
John saw Him on the shore,
     the Lamb forevermore,
Oh, Christ, the Crucified of
      Calvary.

CHORUS
Oh, I love that Man from 
   Galilee, form Galilee,
For He's done so very 
     much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins, 
   placed the Holy
Ghost within;
Oh, I love that man from 
   Galilee. 

The publican went to pray 
   in the temple there one day,
he cried, "" O Lord, be merciful
   to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin,
  and a deep peace placed within;
He said, "" Come see this Man
     from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk, 
the dumb  Was man to talk,
That power was spoken with
     love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see,
     I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man from 
    Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, 
    to know the way of right,
He asked the Son of man 
    what must he do.
These words He said to him, 
  ""Ye must be born again,""
By the spirit of that man fro
   Galilee.

The woman at the well, He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands she had at that time.
She was forgiven of every sin, and a deep 
Peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that Man from Galilee!"""
810;OH, WONT YOU WATCH?;;"Oh, won't you watch with
     me one hour,
While I go yonder, while I
      go yonder?
 Oh, won't you watch with 
     me one hour, 
 While I go yonder and pray?"
811;THE BEAUTY OF JESUS;;"Let the beauty of Jesus be
    seen in me, 
All His wonderful passion
     and purity;
O Thou Spirit divine, all my
     nature refine,
Till the beauty of Jesus is
     seen in me."
812;WINGS OF A DOVE;;"Noah had drifted 
On the flood many days
He searched for land 
In various ways;
Troubles he had some
But not from above,
God gave him his sign 
On the wings of a dove.

CHORUS
On the wings of a snow 
     white dove
God sends, his pure, 
     sweet, love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

Jesus, our saviour
Came to earth one day
He was born in a stable
In a manger of hay
Though here rejected
But not from above
God gave us His sing
On the wings of a dove

Though I have suffered 
In many a way 
I cried for healing 
Both night and day
Faith wasn't forgotten
By the Father above
He gave me His sign 
On the wings of a dove"
813;ROOM AT THE CROSS;;"The cross upon which 
     Jesus died
Is a shelter in which we 
     can hide
And its grace so free is 
      sufficient for me
And deep is its fountain; as 
      wide as the sea

CHORUS
There's room at the cross 
    for you
There's room at the cross 
     for you
Though millions have come, 
     there's still room for one
Yes there is room at the cross 
     for you

Though millions have found 
    Him a friend 
And have turned from the sins 
     they have sinned
The saviour still waits to open
     the gate
And welcome a sinner before 
     it's too late

The hand of my Saviour is 
    strong
And the love of my Saviour 
     is long,
Through sunshine or rain, 
     through loss or in gain
The blood flows from Calv'ry 
    to cleanse every stain."
814;SPEAK, MY LORD;;"Hear the Lord of harvest 
    sweetly calling
""Who will go and work
     for Me today?
Who will bring to Me the
    lost and dying?
Who will point them to the 
    narrow way?""

CHORUS
Speak my Lord, speak 
    my Lord
Speak and I'll be quick
     to answer Thee;
Speak my Lord, speak 
    my Lord
Speak and I'll answer 
     ""Lord send me""

When the coal of fire 
    touched the prophet,
Making him as pure as 
    pure can be
When the voice of God, 
    said ""Who'll go for us?""
Then he answered, ""Here
    I am send me.""

Millions now in sin and 
    shame are dying
Listen to their sad and 
     bitter cry
Hasten, brother hasten 
     to the rescue
Quickly answer ""Master 
    here I am""

Soon the time for reaping 
    will be over;
Soon we'll gather for the
    harvest home;
May the Lord of harvest 
    smile upon us,
 May we hear His blessed 
    ""Child well done."""
815;THE CIRCUIT RIDER;;"The circuit rider preacher went 
    riding through the land
With a rifle on his shoulder and 
      a Bible in his hand
He told the praire people of a 
      blessed Promised land
As he went riding, singing along

Leaning, leaning 
Leaning on the everlasting arm
Leaning, leaning 
Leaning on the everlasting arm

He preached the coming 
   judgment of fire and brimstone
And a glorious endless Heaven 
     of the justified alone
As he rode across the mountains
     you could hear him sing this song



There is power, power, wonder 
    working power
In the blood of the lamb
There is power, power, wonder
    working power
In the precious blood of the lamb.

His rifle is old and rusty and 
    hanging on the wall
His Bible's worn and dusty and its'
      seldom touched at all;
But his Message from this Bible
    will meet us at Judgment Day
For God's truth keeps marching on.

Glory, glory hallelujah! 
Glory, glory hallelujah! 
Glory, glory hallelujah! 
His truth is marching on"
817;UNDEFILED;;"It's a world of compromise
Standards have lowered
Making lives, so devalued,
Till our moral codes are lost

But in the midst of all the scenes
We have virtues thats within
God once displayed 
No matter what the cause - cost


CHORUS
Undefiled real pure lives
Walking Holy and upright
Keep the flag flying high 
By living clean and undefiled

And when we walk down 
    the streets
All the people that we meet 
Will see we can't be sold 
     out cheap 
We are worth much more

When temptations fall on us
Lets turn and run from evil snares
For our bodies are the temple of the Lord

It seems like our species fast becoming extinct
Survival in earth's atmosphere gets harder every day
But the same God who saved my soul
Is more than able to keep us whole
And present us before Christ undefiled."
818;FOUNTAIN OPEN;;"For I will take you 
From the nations 
And bring you to your own land
And I'll be sanctified in you
Before the eyes of man
A new heart will I give you
And place my spirit within
I'll sprinkle clean water upon you
And save you from your sins.

There is a fountain open 
In the house of David
To you who will believe
And there are streams 
   of grace
that's flowing down from
     Calvary
Come now and receive.

And I will pour 
Upon the house of my  chosen one
The spirit of grace and  supplication
And in the day, what a 
     day that will be
A fountain shall be opened up
And we shall be wholly clean

There is a fountain filled 
     with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel's 
    veins
And tell me what can wash 
    away my sins
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
And there's no other  fount I know
But the fountain opened in the house
Of David to you who believe
And there are streams of grace 
     that's flowing down
From Calvary come now and receive"
820;I Pledge Allegiance to the Lamb;;"I have heard how Christians long ago
Were brought before a tyrant's throne;
They were told that he would spare their lives
If they would renounce the name of Christ;
But one by one they chose to die
The Son of God they would not deny;
Like a great angelic choir sing,
I can almost hear their voices ring

CHORUS
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb,
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honour His command
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb.

Now the years have come,
And the years have gone,
But the cause of Jesus still goes on;
Now the time has come to count the cost,
To reject this world,
To embrace the Cross,
And one by one, let us give our lives,
For the One who died to give us life;
Till the Trumpet sounds on that final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say.

To the lamb of God,
Who bore my pain,
Who took my place,
Who wore my shame,
I will seek to honour His command;
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb."
821;IT'S MY DESIRE;;"It's my desire to be like Jesus
It's my desire to be like Him
Though often I have failed Him 
And brought him much shame
It's my desire to live for Him.

It's my desire to help someone 
   today
Someone who may have failed 
   to see the way
I too was once so lost but I found 
   my way to God
It's my desire to live for Him.

If you could see where Jesus 
    brought me from
To where I am today, you would 
    know the reason
Why I love Him so
Now you can take this world's 
    wealth and riches
I don't need these things
It's my desire to live for Him."
822;ABIDE WITH ME;;"Abide with me
Fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens 
Lord  with me abide
When other helpers 
Fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless 
Lord abide with me.

Swift to His close 
Ebbs out life's little day
Earth's joy grow dim, 
Its glories pass away
Change and decay 
In all round I see
Oh thou who changest not 
Abide with me.

Come not in terrors
As the King of kings
But kind and good
With healing in Thy wings
Tears for all woes
A heart for every plea
Come friend of sinners
Thus abide with me

I need thy presence 
Every passing hour
What but thy grace 
Can foil the tempter's power
Who like thyself 
My guide and stay can be
Through cloud and sunshine
Lord abide with me.

I fear no foe with Thee
At hand to bless
I'lls have no weight
And tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting
Where, grave thy victory
I triumhp still if Thou 
Abide with me

Keep  thou thy cross 
Before  my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom 
And  point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks
And  earth's vain shadows flee
In life in death, Oh Lord 
Abide with me."
823;THE UNSEEN HAND;;"There is an unseen hand 
   for me
That leads through waves 
   I can not sail
While going through this 
    world of woe
This hand still leads me as
     I go

Chorus
I'm trusting to this unseen 
  hand
That guides me through this
    weary land
And some sweet day I'll reach 
    that strange land
Still guided by this unseen 
    hand."
824;BUILD MY MANSION;;"Just built my mansion next 
   door to Jesus
And tell the angels I'm 
    coming home
It doesn't matter who lives 
    around me
Just hope my mansion sets 
      near the throne

Chorus
I have got a mansion just 
     over the hilltop
In that bright land
Where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder 
I'll nevermore wonder
We'll walk the streets that are
    purest gold

I have no castle nor earthly 
   Kingdom
I know he'll guide me till I 
    get home
My home up yonder, the 
    streets are gold
And I hope my mansion sets
    near the throne."
825;I HAVE OVERCOME;;"I have overcome

826;SHOUT TO THE LORD;;"My Jesus, my Saviour
Lord there is none like you
All of my days
I want to praise the wonders 
   of your mighty love

My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath and all that
    I have
Never cease to worship you

Shout to the Lord all the earth let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King
Mountains bow down and seas will roar
At the sound of your name
I sing for joy at the works of your hand
Forever I love you, forever I'll stay
Nothing compares to the promise I have in you"
827;THE HONEST IN HEART;;"The first pull contacted the flesh of men,
But did not reach the soul
The second discerned the honest ones
And the third went back for them
He's promised a second ride
And has returned to prove His word
He's here with us who're honest in heart.x2

chorus
He's going back for the honest in heart
Who laid down their lives within the sacrifice
He's going back for the honest in heart 
Going back for the honest in heart

By faith Rahab the harlot
Perished not with all the rest
She received the spies with peace
And she was blessed
The token was applied
And even though the walls fell down
(The spies went back for her)
(She was saved) she was honest in her heart.x2

On His way to Jerusalem
He picked up the ones and twos
Blind man Bartemaeus
And little Zacchaeus too
We've seen Him repeated in the bride
As she moves on
He's seeking out all the honest in their heart x2

Our lord so rich in mercy
Even there upon the cross
Love burned deep within His heart
To reach out for the lost
The thief hung at His side
Humbly asked to be remembered 
And in that hour He reached out for an honest one.

Even way down in South Africa
As we've heard it testified 
How the Lord worked things out
He never forgets his own
No matter what condition
He kept His word
He reached out for the honest in the heart x2"
828;I'LL JUST STILL AWAY;;"Every time I do a thing I 
    should not do
Every time I say a word I 
     should not say
Let me tell you what I'll do 
Then He brings the blessings
     too
I'll just still away somewhere 
    and pray.

chorus
I'll just still away
I'll just still away
And I ask my precious Lord 
   to lead the way
I'll just still away
I'll just still away
I'll just still away somewhere 
    and pray.

Precious savior always hears 
As I'm just praying
And He gives me many

From those who went astray
And said to them that were left
Will you also go away.

chorus
To whom shall we…go
Lord there is no one that I know
That can satisfy this longing deep within
For there is nothing in this life
In this world of toils and strive
So to whom shall we go

This mighty King has spoken again
Through the seventh angle's voice
That we might hear the word of God

Where we stand for God and
Right away will go astray
He speaks today as he did to them.
Will you also go."

And I'm sure that you will

So help me be what you 
    will have me be.

Help me love when others 
    do me wrong
If I'm sad help me sing a

In the beautiful Garden of Eden
When God made man and placed him 
Over the earth to have dominion
But he saw man was alone
He had no one to share his home

So God put man into a sleep
And took from his side
One of his ribs close to his heart.
With which he formed his bride
His missing rib had been restored 
His missing rib was in bride form

The bride has come all dressed in white
A veil she has put on 
She's come to stand at the side of him
Who she was taken from 
His missing rib has been restored
Hi missing rib was in bride form."
840;AFTER ALL;C;"Trials here are sometimes many
And oft times my feet grows weary
Till it seems I almost stumble and fall

After all.

chorus
After all this life is over 
And our burdens have been lifted 
And we stand upon the mountain 
   top so tall
Looking over in that city
That our savior is preparing 
Gives me faith that I can make it
After all.

By my self I cannot make it
But I know he is there to help me

Just a few more days to labour 
After all"

So be thou strong and good courage
As he was with Moses
So He'll be with thee

Going out of Egypt's land
Into the Promised Land

844;IT'S THE SPIRIT;;"If words could describe just how I feel inside
I'd write a song concerning my dear Lord
The words should be beyond compare to any ever wrote
To glorify the one that I adore
But my words could not explain just why he bore my shame
Nor testify concerning the love he has shown
My song could never fill the heart of a hungry thirsty soul
But is the spirit in God's word that makes men whole.

And He tells me I am His own,
And the joy we share as we tarry there,

Is so sweetthe birds hush their singing,
And the melody,
That He gave to me 
Within my heart is ringing 

I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be falling, 
But He bids me go,
Through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling"

Chorus
What would you give?
 What would you give
What would you give
in exchange for your soul?
Oh if today should God call it away,
What would you give in exchange for 
your soul?

Mercy is calling you, won't you give 
heed?
Must the dear Saviour still tenderly 
plead?
Risk not your soul it's precious indeed;
What would you give in exchange for 
your soul?

More than the silver and gold of the 
earth,
More than all jewels thy spirit is worth!
God, the Creator, has given it birth!
What would you give in exchange for 
your soul?

If, when you stand at the bar by and by,
When you are weighed in the balance on 
high,
You should be sentenced forever to die,
What would you give in exchange for 
your soul?"
883;When He Reached Down;;"Once my soul was astray from 
     the heavenly way
And was wretched and vile as 
      could be
But my Saviour above, gave me 
       peace, joy and love
When He reached down His hand 
      for me, for me

Chorus
When He reached down His hand 
      for me,
When He reached down His hand
      for me,
I was lost and undone, without God or
       His Son,
When He reached down His hand for
     me, for me

I was nearing despair, when He came 
     to me there
And He showed me that I could be free,
Then He lifted my feet, gave me glory   
     complete,
When He reached down His hand for me, 
     for me.

How my heart doth rejoice since I made 
      Him my Choice
From the tempest to Him now I flee;
Now I lean on His arm, I'm secure from 
    all harm,
Since He reached down His hand for me

Since the Lord gave me peace, heavenly 
      joys never cease;
Lord I give all my life unto Thee;
Guide my feet, hold my hand, grant with 
      Thee I may stand,
For you reached down your hand for me."
884;Old Rugged Cross;;"On a hill far away

Chorus
So I'll cherish 
The old rugged cross
Till my trophies
At last I lay down
I will cling to the 
Old rugged cross
And exchange it some day
For a crown

Oh that old rugged cross
So despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction
For me
For the Dear Lamb of God
Left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In the old rugged cross
Stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see.
For 'twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me.

To the old rugged cross
I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach
Gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day
To my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share"

But he'll do it again.

My God knows the pain 
You're going through and he knows
How you're hurting,
You see, he knows just how your
Heart has been broken in two,
But he is the God of the stars and of 
The sun and of the sea,
And he is your father.
He can calm the storm and find a way
To take care of you.

BRIDGE
He's still God
And he will not fail you
He's still God
And he cannot change.
Know that he is God,
And he is fighting for you,
Just like Moses,
Just like Daniel,
Just like Shadrack, Meshack, Aberdnego."

For my transgressions
That He paid the price 
A long long time ago
When He gave His life for me
On a hill called calvary
But there's something else
That I want to know

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail
Does He hear the crowd cry
Crucify'm again
Am I causing Him pain
Then I know I've got to change
Cause I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

Seems that I'm so good 
At breaking promises
That I treat His precious grace
So carelessly
That each time He forgives
What if He relieved
The agony He felt 
On the tree

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail
Can He hear the crowd cry
Crucify'm again
Am I causing Him pain
Then I know I've got to change
Cause I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

HOLY HOLY HOLY is the Lord 
HOLY HOLY HOLY is the Lord


Do You still feel the nails
Every time I fail
Am I crucifying You Jesus 
With my sins
Oh I'm tired of playing games
I really want to change
I never want to hurt You again

HOLY HOLY HOLY is the Lord

One more time dear Jesus, I need your

I'm just asking, ONE MORE TIME
For grace that I can stand.

Not to have one guilty feeling
Not to wonder where you're going when you die.
Not condemned of your past
Not afraid of what tomorrow holds in store
And know the reason why
It's like just how it is
When you go down in the waters
Of the saints you believe in what you heard
It's not impossible dream
You can start over clean
When you're washed by the waters of the word.

CHORUS
Are you washed by the waters
Washed by the waters of the word	x2

It's like being born again
With a whole new life to live
Never having to look back to what you've been
Cause according to the Lord 
You just started your existence and where he can say
There never was no sin.
For when God looks your way
He no longer sees a sinner but a saint
Who've been washed white as
It's not by anything you've done
But by the blood of God's own son
Are washed by the waters of the word."

I know the Lord will fix it for you. (x2)
If I hold to His hand

I know the Lord will fix it for me (x2)"

I can see in your eyes the questions
       you've asked before 
Isn't there more, something more?

Chorus
And I have found the Lord 
    you've been searching for.
I have found true peace and real joy
He's a treasure that this world 
    does not contain
Jesus Christ He's the more 
 you're searching for.


He said if you would seek for
     Him with all your heart And soul
Then He would be found of you,  
you could know that you know
And your loneliness He will replace 
with a union you've known.
Yes there's more He's so much more.


Last verse -Chorus

I have found the Lord you've
     been searching for.

For I have news for you

Chorus
It is no secret what God can do
What He has done for others
He'll do for you
With arms wide open
He'll pardon you

Don't run away and hide."

And I feel a strange excitement
     in the air.

Chorus
Just anyday now our Lord 
    is coming
He'll be returning for you and me
Oh I've been watching and 
     I've been waiting 
Just anyday His face I'll see.

There has this longing in my 
    heart of His appearing

Lord help me today show me the 
   way one day at a time

Do you remember when you 
    walked amongst man?
Well Jesus you know, if you looking

934;I'D LIKE TO TALK IT OVER WITH HIM;;"Some morning when I stand 
in God's wonderful city
Where the light from heaven's 
glory will never grow dim
Then I'd shake hands with the 
Saviour who gave me life eternal
And I'd love to talk it over with Him.
	

Chorus
I'd love to kneel down and talk 
it all over with Him
I'd love to say Lord, you loved 
me when my path was so dim
I cannot repay Him when I meet
 Him in that city of gold 
Lord I'd love to talk it over 
And thank Him for His wonderful love.


We'll be singing Halleluahs 
forever and ever
For we'll take a cup of gladness
 He'll fill to the brim
But I know that I had brought 
Him some deep tears and sorrow
And I'd love to talk it over with Him."
935;YEARS I SPENT IN VANITY;;"Years I spent in vanity and pride
Caring not my Lord was crucified
Knowing not it was for me He died
At Calvary
	
Chorus
Mercy there was great and grace was free
Pardon there was multiplied to me
There my burdened soul found liberty
At Calvary


Oh the love that drew salvation's plan
Oh the grace that brought it down to man
Oh the mighty gulf that God did spurn
At Calvary

Now I've given Jesus everything
Now I gladly own Him as my King
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary"
936;I LOVE HIM TOO MUCH;;"When I first heard of Jesus
His love and His Grace
My heart was overwhelmed
To think a King would take my place 
I cried Lord I'll go with you.
Every step of the way
That's all I can do
My debt to repay

CHORUS
I love Him too much 
To fail Him now
I love Him too much
To break my bond
For I promised 
The Lord that I would make 
it somehow
And I love Him too much
To fail Him now

When I told Him I loved Him, 
It was so easy to say
But harder to prove, when
 temptation came my way
All my good unbroken promises 
I counted it but lost
When I caught a glimpse of true love
Hanging on a rugged cross

And now the years have drawn us closer
My love for Him has grown
Each step has brought me near, 
to my eternal home
And now its too close to Heaven 
to turn back now
He said His Grace would be sufficient
I'm gonna make it somehow."
937;I'M GONNA LIVE THE WAY HE WANTS ME TO LIVE;;"There's been times when giving 
and loving brought pain
And I promised I could never 
let it happen again
But I found out that loving 
was worth of the risk
And that even in losing you win.
	
Chorus

I'm gonna live the way 
He wants me to live
I'm gonna give until there's 
just no more to give
I'm gonna love, love till 
there's just no more love
I could never, ever out love the Lord.

He showed us that only 
through dying we live.
And He gave when it seems 
there was nothing to give
He loved, when loving brought
 heartaches and loss
And He forgave from an 
old rugged cross."
938;LET YOUR WORD BE BORNE IN A MANGER OF MY HEART;;"It was a tiny simple stable
    oh bitterly borne
Hardly a place for a King to be born
He didn't choose some place special
To reveal His majesty
So I know if I'll give Him control
He'll be borne in me

CHORUS
Let your word be born in 
   a manger of my heart
Let it live in me let it start
Live inside this house of clay
And mold it everyday
Let your word be borne in a
    manger of my heart


Well, outwardly I'm nothing
Not much to behold
Unlikely a place for His
   word to unfold
But if I just yield this vessel
And let Him have His way
From glory unto glory
He'll change me day be day."
939;YOU DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND, JUST HOLD HIS HAND;;"Life is like a mighty sea so
  tossed and driven
Billows rise within the heart of
   every man
Storms so many times will leave 
    the hearts with questions
You don't need to understand 
  just hold His hand

CHORUS
You don't need to understand
You just need to hold His hand
You don't have the need to ask 
   the reason why
For I know He'll make a way
Through the night and through the day
You don't need to understand, 
   just hold His hand


When my life down here is through 
    one day He'll call me
To my home up there upon the golden shore
He will then review the past that lays behind me
And I won't need to understand just anymore"
940;I HAVE FOUND A PRECIOUS FRIEND;;"I have found a precious friend 
and Jesus is His name
He's the one the bible tells us
He heals the blind the sick and lame 
And since, I found this friend I
 have never been the same
All I know I wanna do is to glorify His name


Many times when I'm in trouble 
I call upon His name
And He has never been too busy 
He just listens again
Then He sends living waters to 
flow from deep within
Making it easy to forget how 
troubled I have been
	

And when I talk to Him in 
prayer everyday
He listens patiently to every 
word I have to say
He will never, no never ever turn me away
Cause He is my best friend 
and will be unto the end
Oh yes He is my best friend and 
will be unto the end"
941;THANK YOU LORD FOR YOUR BLESSINGS ON ME;;"As the world looks upon us
As we struggle along

How I wish they could see

Chorus
I have a roof up above me
I've a good place to sleep
There's food on my table
And there's shoes on my feet
You gave me your love Lord
And a fine family
Oh thank you Lord for blessings on me

I know I'm not wealthy
And these clothes are not new
I don't have much money
But Lord I have you
And to me that solves the matter
Though the world may not see
Oh thank you Lord for your blessings on me"
943;THE LOVE, THE LOVE OF JESUS;;"The love, the love of Jesus, He gives to me is great
The love, the love of Jesus, He gives to me is sweet
The Love, the love of Jesus, He gives to me is wonderful
 Why don't you try, just try to love one another

Chorus
Love your enemy just as you love your friend
Love your neighbour just as you love yourself
Love one another, just as God loved the world
Why don't you try, just try to love one another


The love, the love of Jesus, He gives to you is great
The love, the love of Jesus, He gives to you is sweet
The Love, the love of Jesus, He gives to you is wonderful

944;WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR THE LORD TO COME AGAIN;;"As I woke up in the morning
Of each day that passes by
And I listen to the sound upon my ears
I can hear and keep a watch, towards the eastern  
sky
And I wonder if the trumpet will be next sound that I hear.

CHORUS
What a beautiful day for the Lord to come again;
What a beautiful day for him to take his children 
Home
How I long to see his face and to touch his nail scarred hands
What a beautiful day for the Lord to come again.

All my earthly disappointments, and my trial that I 
have  
Fade away when I remember his last words
He said He'd come and receive the children unto 
Him
And I'm longing just to look upon the face of my Lord"
945;LOST ONE DON'T ROAM;;"Have you stumbled in the darkness
The light you cannot see

You ought to cry Lord, save me
Lost one don't roam

Waiting and watching

Outside its dark and cold
Won't you come back to the fold
Lost one don't roam

Yes He knows you're unhappy
And all about your fears

And wipe away each tear
To Him you are so precious
He wants to keep you so near 
Lost one do'nt roam
Just you come Home"
946;I LOVE YOU LORD;;"All the treasures on earth
could never repay
What Jesus has done for me
That's the way God the father
Had planned it to be
When He sent His only son
to rescue me
And I can never repay
But I can just, say Lord I love thee


CHORUS
I love you Lord although I'm not
worthy
I'm not worthy for the price you 
paid for me
And I could never repay
But I can just say Lord I love Thee

Why He loved me so
I really don't know
But I know He cares for me
Oh and I had never known
The love that He had shown
When He died upon the cross
for worthless me
And I could never repay
But i can just say 
Lord I love thee"

To pay a debt for you and me
2000 years ago.

CHORUS
2000 years ago and today He's
still the same
It thrills a joy inside of me
Each time I hear His name
If I had to pay for all my sins
Oh what a debt I owed
But Jesus paid it all for me
2000 years ago.

It's a lovely life since He came in
and took control of me
I'll praise the name of Jesus
Throughout eternity

Because of what He did for me

He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, ""Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit,""
And somehow Jesus came and brought
To me the victory

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there
The song of victory."

And I began to pray
And my mind just failed to know
Exactly why
I can't explain with tongue or  pen 
The spirit's groanings deep within
It must be God
Deep in my soul
Coz I feel the pull


Chorus
I feel the pull (I feel the pull)
I hear His Voice (I hear His Voice)
And I know His Spirit is moving me 
To give my all
He speaks to me (He speaks to me)
And I agree (And I agree)
Lord please come and take control
I feel the pull

I went to hear the word
With each line and verse
He was drawing me to give a higher
 praise
As the deep call to the deep
Like a great magnet pulling me
I know for sure
That I'll reach the goal
Cause I feel the pull"

Underneath the cloudless sky
I'm drinking at the fountain 
That never shall run dry;
O yes I'm feasting on the manna
From a bountiful supply
For I am dwelling in Beulah Land

Far below the storm of doubt
Upon the world is beating,
Sons of men in battle long
The enermy withstand;
Safe am I within the castle
Of God's Word retreating,
Nothing then can reach me
'Tis Beulah Land

Let the stormy breezes blow
Their cry cannot alarm me,
I am safely sheltered here,
Protected by God's hand;
Here the sun is always shinning,
Here there's naught can harm me
I am safe for ever
In Beulah land

Viewing here the works of God,
I sink in contemplation
Hearing now His blessed voice,
I see the way He planned;
Dwelling in the spirit here,
I learn of full salvation,
Gladly will I tarry
In Beulah Land."

A moment here and a moment gone
Like a flower he fades away
But I just want to stay right on 
To that perfect day

Take rest my soul, in no other arms 
Save Jesus only today
For He has opened my eyes to see	
That judgment is on its way;
And though ten thousand fall at my side
I will never be tossed aside
For in the shadow of that mighty 
      rock is where I'll abide.

Lord take Thy Word, Thy precious Word
And anoint it to my soul;
Perfect what is lacking in my faith
And make thy servant whole.
Drive all fears and all doubts away,
For I just want to hear you say,
""Receive, Receive thy crown my 
       beloved son,
You have overcome, well done!"""

The reason for all fears would all subside
If she could take that robe of white
Dressed in all His Grace
The love of Christ would shine upon her face
But her love could not be known if Christ is never shown
In the life in which the love in her has grown
Her love could never win the hearts of the lost
 and lonely souls
But the Spirit in His Word can make them whole"

My Savior helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet, entangled with briars

My Savior whispers His promise, 
""I never will leave thee alone.""

He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side;
For me He opened the fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He's waiting in glory,
Seated upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone."

Now Cain was the seed of satan
While Abel was the seed of God
Now they tried to walk together
And they found they could not agree

Chorus
How can two walk together
Unless they both agree
One believed in trinity doctrine
And the other believed in one God

Now Cain looked for fame and beauty
While Abel sought the face of God
Now they tried to walk together
But they found they could not agree

Those two spirits that started in eden
Still rule in man's hearts today
One spirit will give you worldly wisdom
And the other the true Word of God"

Just what I see
I am of a special kind
When He was on the cross 
I was on His mind

CHORUS

He knew me yet He loved me
He whose glory makes the heaven shine
So unworthy, of such mercy
When He was on the cross, I was on His mind.



The look of love was on His face
The thorns upon His head
The blood ran down
His scarlet robe
It stained with crimson red
Though His eyes were on the cross that day
Jesus looked ahead in time
For when He was on the cross
You and I were on His mind."

two thousand years ago

CHORUS
Two thousand years ago
And today He's still the same
It thrills a soul inside of me
each time I hear His name
If I had to pay for all my sins
Oh what a debt I owed
But Jesus paid it all for me
Two thousand years ago


It's a lovely life since He came in
and took control of me
I will praise the name of Jesus
Throughout eternity
The world may think I'm fooling
But Oh I love Him so
Because of what He did for me
Two thousand years ago"

Beauty no mind can comprehend

So I just cried and said, ""Forgive me Lord,

When I count the times I fall
'Cause He promised I'd be victorious
When I knew I'm not at all
Then I heard an eagle scream,
Its voice quickened my soul
He said ""You've not done it in the first
 place, you're justified.""

He Looked at a perfect picture
Without blame, spot or wrinkle
He didn't look at you where you are now,
He looked down from Eternity
He said you're just trapped in that body
You bypassed your Theophany:
You have not done it in the first place,

A need to know as 
We were always known
For it won't be long again
You can see we're at the end
Slacken not your riding
Continue to sigh and cry
You must have the token 
To take the heavenly flight

Though we've been grieved 
By various trials
That the genuineness of 
Our faith maybe tried
For at the end of our faith
We'll receive salvation for our souls
A glorious body a son 
In the image of the word
United with theophany
We'll be one with the living God

I see a world that's judged
No where to run, 
No where to hide
I'll only escape 
Into faith inside"

1242;Cow Boy's Meditation;;"Last night as I laid on the prairie
I gazed to the stars in the skies
And I wondered if ever a cowboy
Could drift to that sweet bye and bye

,There is a road to that bright, happy Region
But it's dim there, a trail , so they say,
But the broad one that leads to perdition
Is posted and blazed all the way.

They speak of another great Owner,
And He's never overstocked, so they say
He'll always make room for a sinner
That will drift on that straight, narrow way

They say He'll never forsake you,
And He knows every action and look;
For safety we'd better get branded,
Have our name on His great tally Book

For they say there will be a great roundup
When cowboys like dogies will stand
To be marked by the ridders of judgement,
That's posted and knows every brand

I guess I wont be a stray yearling,
Just a man that's condemned to die
That will be cut in the bunch with the rustics,
When the Boss of those ridders come by."

1252;The Great Judgement Morning;C;"I dreamed that the great judgement 
 morning.
Had dawned and thetrumpet had blown
I dreamed that the nations were gathered
To judgement before the white throne
From the throne came a bright shining 
 angel
And stood on the land and the sea
And swore with his hand raised to heaven
That time was no longer to be.

Chorus
And O, what a weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate
They cried to the rocks and the mountains
They prayed but their prayers were too late

The rich man was there but his money
Had melted and vanished away;
A pauper he stood in the judgement,
His debts were too heavy to pay;
The great man was there but his greatness
When death came was left far behind
The angel that opened the records,
Not a trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there and the orphans,
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven for ever, 
God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
The gambler was there and the drunkard ,
And the man that had sold them the drink
With the people who gave them the license.
Together in hell they did sink.

The moral man came to the judgement
But his self-righteous rags would not do;
The men who had crucified Jesus
Had passed off as the moral men, too;
The soul that had put off salvation,
""Not tonight; I'll get saved by and by,
No time now to think of religion
At last they had found time to die"

My Father is rich in

He holdeth the wealth of 
      the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, 
      of silver and gold
His coffers are full, 
     He has riches untold.

CHORUS
I'm a child of the King!
A child of the King!
With Jesus my Saviour,
I'm a child of the King!

My Father's own Son, 
      the Saviour of men,
Once wandered o'er earth 
     as the poorest of  them;
But now He is reigning 
     forever on high,
And will give me a home 
     in heav'n by and by.

I once was an outcast, 
     stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, 
     and an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted, 
     my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, 
     a robe, and a crown.

A tent or a cottage, 
     why should I care?
They're building a palace 
     for me over there!
Though exiled from home, 
     yet still I may sing:
All glory to God, 
     I'm a child of the King!"

1333;JESUS IS ALL;Db;"From a world, a world of sin and
shame,
Jesus brought me out
And into the light I came;
Showed me truth so I’ll not be
deceived,
His word I believe,
Now I live to lift His name.


CHORUS
For Jesus is all,
He’s all that I have to live for,
And even though His way seem hard
sometimes
The end’s eternal life,
So I live for Jesus Christ,
So I live for Jesus Christ.


I hold close the opportunity
That’s been given me
To serve the Lord in my day;
Tell me what could be a greater
privilege than to serve God in this
age,
To walk in His provided way.


We can’t live in a world of fantasy,
Of worldly thoughts and dreams,
They will fade away so fast;
But this truth, this word that sets us
free, is the only reality,
It is the only thing that always shall
last."
1334;UNDEFILED;;"It’s a world of compromise,
Standards have lowered, making lives
So devalued till all moral codes are
lost,
But in the midst of all the sin
We have virtues that’s within
God wants displayed, no matter what
the cost.


CHORUS
Undefiled - real pure lives,
Walking holy and upright;
Keep that flag flying high
By living clean and undefiled.


And when we walk down the street,
All the people that we meet
Will see we can’t be sold out cheap,
We’re worth much more;
When the temptation’s drawing near
Let’s turn and run from the evil snare,
For our bodies are the temple of the
Lord.


BRIDGE
Seem like our specie’s fast becoming
extinct,
Survival in earth’s atmosphere gets
harder everyday,
But the same God who saved our
souls
Is more than able to keep us whole,
And present us before Christ
undefiled"
1335;IN DEATH THERE IS VICTORY;Db;"Up the hill with the load,
Jesus walked up Calvary’s road.
No man took His life from Him,
For you and me He willingly gave.
In His mind, He held a vision,
It was of the resurrection,
Truly He paid death’s price;
Our victory’s complete
In the perfect sacrifice.


CHORUS
In death, in death,
In death, there’s victory.
Self sacrifice means freedom,
And this is the way for me.
For the joy set before,
There’s a cross to endure.
For real life, this I see,
That in death there’s victory.


Abraham held the promise,
‘In Isaac shall thy seed be called.’
He died to his own thinking,
When God told him sacrifice his boy.
Obedient unto death he was faithful,
Knowing resurrection was in the end.
This he said: “The lad and I, we’ll go
worship,
And come to you again.”


By faith Jocebed placed Moses
In the mouth of death on the river
Nile,
Pharaoh’s daughter, finding him,
To the house of death she took the
child,
There he lived with those who sought
his life,
And to the desert he had to flee,
Where he died to his own thinking,
To lead Israel to their victory.


Tell me now, Bride of Christ,
We’re not different, we must pay the
price,
As we lift up our cross,
Though we suffer and our lives are lost;
Yet we must die to ourselves and sin,
Truly become a burnt-offering,
But it’s sure in the end,
That we will rise again."
1336;CANT YOU HEAR;C;"A new day has dawned
And I know not what it brings,
But somehow I feel I’m almost home;
Not turning back to yesterday
But pressing towards my calling in
Christ,
I can hear, yes I can hear my
theophany calling me.


CHORUS
And can’t you hear your theophany
calling you?
It’s a sign, it’s almost home time,
And I’m just waiting for my promised
body change,
For soon I know, we’ll be with Him on
high.


The whole earth is groaning and
travailing in pain,
But we as the bride have been
glorified in Him;
And saints, even though we may
suffer,
Stand and gird your loins,
For your perfection it draweth near.



BRIDGE
My God knows overtime is drawing
near,
And very soon the dead in Christ shall
rise again;
There’ll be no more sickness,
No more crying over there,
But for now, Christian Soldier,
Just keep on pressing."
1337;IT'S NOT TRYING BUT;F;"Sometimes life seems like words
and music
That can’t become a song
And we cry and sigh and we try
again and wonder
What could be wrong
And when we turn to the Lord
At the end of ourselves like we’ve
done at times or before
We’ll find hid truth is the same as it
always been
We never will need more


CHORUS
It’s not in trying but in trusting
It’s not in running but in resting
It’s not in wondering but in praying
That we find the strength of the Lord


He’s all we need for our every
needs
He’ll never leave thee alone
But the last move that we choose
To do to live a life on our own
But the only good that could ever be
said
Are the pain we find ourselves in
Yet there are places to gain the
wisdom
To say I’ll never leave him again"
1338;THIS IS THE HOUR;C;"Bride of Christ, for so long we’ve
been waiting
For our promised king has come
We await his appearing
We’re being tested, we’re being
tried
We’ve cried and we’ve sighed
Since 1963 we’ve heard these
things will be
But first the squeeze will come
A quick short ride and then it’s done
This is the hour


CHORUS
This is the hour that we’ve all been
waiting for
This is the hour; the bridegroom is
at the door
This is the hour, of his appearing
The trumpet shall sound and we’ll
go home
This is the hour


End time Daniel’s you arise
This is the time of the evening
The king of Babylon has come
He’s plundering and devouring
He’s causing men to bow
Passing laws even now
But prayer’s the only way out
Daniels trust and don’t you doubt
That Michael your prince will stand
And in the fire you’ll meet the Son of
man
This is the hour


End time Esthers you awake
The seven thunders are sounding
Our Hatach has brought the news
Of the genocide that’s coming
It’s time to intercede
For your people you must plead
In the spirit of sacrifice
Be willing to give your life
But the sceptre is in the king’s hand
And your desire is his command
In this hour


Soon he’ll be coming for }3X
Coming to take me home"
1339;MANSION ON THE HILLTOP;C;"I’m satisfied with just a cottage
below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city, where the ransomed
will shine
I want a gold one that’s silver line


CHORUS
I’ve got a mansion just over the
hilltop
In that bright land where we’ll never
grow old
And some day yonder we will never
more wander
But walk on streets that are purest
gold


Tho often tempted, tormented and
tested
And like the prophet, my pillow a
stone
And tho I find here, no permanent
dwelling,
I know He’ll give me a mansion my
own


Don’t think me poorer, deserted or
lonely
I’m not discouraged, I’m heaven
bound
I’m just a pilgrim in search of that
city
I want a mansion, a harp and a
crown."
1340;GREATER IS HE THAT'S WITHIN ME;C;"Greater is he that’s within me
Greater than he that’s in the world
God is master of all circumstances
God has all things under his control
God is greater than any trial
Greater than any trouble you might
have


Yes God is great, God is great
Yes God is great, God is great


At times your soul feels so troubled
At times you might be burdened
with care
Of you feel you’re all out of courage
If you feel in deepest despair
Well God has promised never to
leave you
He promised he’d answer your
prayer
Just call him on the scene
He’s that Holy Ghost within
And he’s greater than any trouble
you may face


Yes God is great, God is great
Yes God is great, God is great


Oftentimes on this pilgrim journey
You’ll have to walk the rugged road
alone
There’ll be no friends and all men
might forsake you
Like Jesus stood before Pilate’s
throne
You’ll have to stand in faith
believing
You’ll have to know that you are his
own
And when you call him on the scene
He’s that Holy Spirit within
And he’s greater than any enemy
you may face

Yes God is great, God is great
Yes God is great, God is great


Our Savior, our deliverer, our Healer
and our Comforter
(Greater than he who’s in the world)
The prince of peace, the mighty
God
The son of man, the risen Lord
(Greater than he who’s in the world)
yes God is greater than any trial
God is greater than all your fears
God is greater than the enemy
around you
God is greater
Yes God is greater, greater in you"

1342;ARISE POSSESS YOUR INHERITANCE;Db;"Arise, possess your inheritance,
For this is the year of jubilee,
Arise, be not entangled with the yoke
of bondage.
Understand the liberty by which Christ
set you free.


Entangled with heavy chains of
captivity,
Bruised and battered by sin,
Condemned and sentenced to a life of
bondage,
O God, there was no peace within.
Then a sound was heard,
It was like the abundance of rain,
Saying “Rejoice, you have received
the atonement,
Accept the pardoning word which was
provided for you,
Because you’re not of the
bondwoman,
You’re of the free.”


Aren’t you tired of living
underprivileged?
Saints, don’t you, don’t you hear that
sound?
Saying freedom to the captives,
Restoration to the blind,
Setting free those who are bruised.
Saints, empty your vessels,
Let Him fill them with oil,
You are free, you are free, you are
free.


So when the creditor comes to take
away your land,
Show him your account
Settled long ago by Calvary’s Lamb,
And say, “I am free, I am free, I am
free.”
Now I can tell the world that I’m free,
I have heard the trumpet sound
Jubilee; Freedom from all burdens
and sin,
The Comforter has given me peace
within.
And whom the Son has set free, }
Is free indeed."
1343;widow with nothing;;"There was nothing left
Just a little bit of oil
That was all she had
Her situation looked hopeless
Life seemed empty
The fire that she had was gone and she could no longer sustain her family
A widow with nothing
She was a widow with nothing
That was her story

With the creditor approaching
In her most desperate time of need
She stood all alone, no friends no family
They read their charges
You cannot pay your debt
Your children now become our ransom
And They shall be taken,
she cried,
""Lord I have nothing left!
I'm a widow with nothing!""
That was her testimony

But, when God heard her desperate cry
He came down for His own
He quickly came to her as He heard the cry of His own.
He led her to find Elisha
The prophet for that hour

Go -- Thus saith the Lord
God had already told me your troubles will be gone.
The story of your life will be different from now on.
Bring every jar you can find,
God will transform your life
The little oil that you have will be multiplied
Even now, Right now

Your children would never be slaves and you would never be, in debt anymore.
God has chosen you and in your home He will work a paradox.




In the house that was empty now has everything.
The widow who was weeping can rejoice and sing.
Where there was nothing, today you can have it all.
Step out by faith and see God multiply your oil
Now your fire's burning, shine your light each day.
You've touched the hem of His garment as He passed your way
All who saw you suffer at the hands of death, now sees the blessings of the Lord.
even now, right now!


Na casa que faltava agora vai sobrar
Viúva que chorava agora vai cantar
Onde não tinha nada hoje vai ter tudo
Aquele que cobrava agora vem pagar
O fogão que era frio agora estar queimando
O seleiro vazio estar transbordando
Quem te viu sofrendo agora estar vendo deus te abençoando
Agora Agora

1344;Let us draw near;G;"Are we weak and troubled or in deep
despair?
Is the avenger of the soul on our trail?
Well, the Name of our Lord is a
Mighty tower
That the righteous can run into and be
safe
.
CHORUS
Let us draw near with a true heart
In full assurance of faith;
That we find grace and strength to
help
In time of need.

It took a perfect sacrifice before
We could ever attain to perfect faith;
That’s why Christ the perfect Lamb,
The atonement came,
And to the Holiest of Holies,
He cleared the way.

We were not made angels, we’re of
mortal kind,
And we daily make mistakes for we
are weak,
But we have not a High Priest who
cannot be touched
With the feelings of our infirmities

So let us draw near having our hearts,
 sprinkled by His blood
For now we have free access
To the throne of God"
1345;what are you going o present;C;"I want to present the life of Christ,
It’s my aim today,
For in His image I want to stand
So blameless on that day;
And though this world may criticize,
It will never understand,
That I can’t rest until I be
A perfect man.

CHORUS
What are you going to present to the
Lord
At the end of your journey?
He’s not going to be touched by
anything
Save His testimony.
What are you going to present to the
Lord?
I hope it makes you sigh and cry,
Don’t be found in that position
Where you would be wondering why.

Though the world may offer its
pleasure and peace,
And its luxurious life of ease,
But it simply cannot continue on
For man’s just like a breeze;
A moment here and a moment gone,
Like a flower he fades away,
But I just want to stay right on
To that perfect day.

Take rest my soul, in no other arms
Save Jesus own today
For He has opened my eyes to see
That judgement is on its way;
And though ten thousand fall at my
side
I will never be tossed aside;
For in the shadow of that mighty rock
is where I’ll abide.

Lord take Thy Word, Thy precious
Word,
And anoint it to my soul;
Perfect what is lacking in my faith
And make thy servant whole.
Drive all fears and all doubts away,
For I just want to hear You say,
“Receive thy crown my beloved son
You have overcome, well done"
