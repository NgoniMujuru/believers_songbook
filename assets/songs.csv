1;A Brand New Touch;;"CHORUS
Lord, You know I need a brand new touch,
My strength from yesterday is gone;
But if You'll give me, Lord, another touch,
I'll have the strength to carry on.

verse 1
I tho't the sun had come to stay,
But all too soon it went away,
And in its place the storm clouds came,
And with the clouds there came the rain;
It rained so hard and oh, so long,
But midst the storm I felt a calm;
It was Your touch that brought
me through it all,
Without Your help I'd surely fall.

verse 2
Yesterday has come and gone,
And now a new day's coming on,
I do not know what it may bring,
My heart may cry instead of sing;
But it matters not what comes my
way, Lord,
If You'll just touch me new each day;
Your loving touch drives all my fears away,
Close by Your side I want to stay.

BRIDGE

Lord, You know how weak I really  am,
Even better than myself;
But with Your help I know I really  can,
Make it thro' the darkest night,
And everything's gonna be all right."

My Father's own Son,
the Saviour of men,
Once wandered o'er earth
as the poorest of  them;
But now He is reigning
forever on high,
And will give me a home
in heav'n by and by.

verse 3
I once was an outcast,
stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice,
and an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted,
my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion,
a robe, and a crown.

verse 4
A tent or a cottage,
why should I care?
They're building a palace
for me over there!
Though exiled from home,
yet still I may sing:
All glory to God,
I'm a child of the King!"
3;A Day In September;;"verse 1
It was a day in September
One lonely night
Something fluttered into my heart
I looked around to see
What could it be
No one else
but the sweet Holy spirit

CHORUS
A snow-white dove
Flew into my heart
Saying don't worry my child
All is well (2x)

My skies were misty
My clouds were dark
Until that day star dawned
in my heart
With a message of grace
Comfort and peace
Bringing an end to all my troubles

And rumours of war
And violence fill the whole world
But before one bomb will fall
He'll take us away
To live eternally"

So seek on Saints,
Seek till you're filled with power;
Seek on saints
Till His Spirit in you is endowed,
It's been revealed,
This is the final hour;
And soon His Bride, His Chosen One
Will go on home.

verse 2
Unmerited the favour that He granted me
To bring me home today, His very Own;
'Twas love, 'twas Grace
That stooped so low to conquer me;
My Sovereign Lord gave Sovereign Grace
To redeem me.

verse 3
And now I'm home, His robe's wrapped around me;
This land is mine, this Promise is for me.
Amazing grace, amazing love
Christ poured on me,
His Word went with a promise,
One day we shall meet."

Where we'll meet again when life is over
Where we will while away the endless hours
On heaven's bright eternal shore.

And the beautiful tree
Of life for us is waiting.
And the prettiest mansions
Made of gold;

We'll all be wearing
In the city four square
Beyond the world of strife
And the prettiest songs
With the Angels we'll be singing

On that eternal morning in the sky
Where we will live in peace through
The endless ages
Where we will never say good-bye.

But now raised up to Mt. Zion
Like our father Abraham

11;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God;;"verse 1
A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe -
His craft and pow'r are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

verse 2
Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He -
Lord Sabaoth His name,
From age to age the same -
And He must win the battle.

verse 3
And tho this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph thru us.
The Prince of darkness grim -
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! His doom is sure -
One little word shall fell him.

verse 4
That word above all earthly pow'rs -
No thanks to them - abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Thru Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still -
His kingdom is forever."

When the heavens opened and I saw

Now I am forgiven and I know,

For Oh Lord,
Thou hast brought up my soul
Thou has kept me alive and from
That I shall not go down to the pit.
Sing unto the Lord, all ye precious saints of His,
And give thanks at the remembrance of His Holiness.

Hear Oh Lord and have mercy upon me,
Lord be my helper,
Thou has turned for me my mourning into dancing;
Thou hast put off my sackclothing,
And girded me with gladness;
To the end my glory may sing praises to Thee.

What profit is there in my blood,
If I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust praise Thee?
Shall it declare Thy truth?
For your anger endureth but a moment;
In Your favour there is life:
Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning."

For right there in the field at harvest time
For so much love in His heart

Thru eyes that see a supernatural place."

The Lord will that day release."

Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in;
When Christ the mighty Maker died
For man, the creature's sin.

Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears;
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt mine eyes to tears.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay,
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
'Tis all that I can do."

When rough the path that I have trod,
Within my closet door retreating,
I love to be alone with God.

Alone with God, the world forbidden.
Alone with God, Oh blest retreat!
Alone with God and in Him hidden,
To hold with Him communion sweet.

What tho' the clouds have
gathered o'er me?
What tho' I've passed beneath the rod?
God's perfect will there lies before me,
When I am thus alone with God.

'Tis there I find new strength for duty,
As o'er the sands of time I plod;
I see the King in all His beauty.
While resting there alone with God.

And when I see the moment nearing
When I shall sleep beneath the sod,
When time with me is disappearing,
I want to be alone with God."

Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race.
'Tis mercy all, immense and free!
For, O my God it found out me!

Verse 3
No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

Verse 4
'Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the first born seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine!
'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more.

Verse 5
Long my imprisoned Spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth and followed Thee."

Dear Lord l thank thee."

But, Oh, the joy when I shall wake,
Within the palace of the King.

CHORUS
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace,
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace.

Some day my earthly house shall fall,
I cannot tell how soon 'twill be,
But this I know, my All in All,
Has now a place in Heaven for me.

Some day when fades the golden sun,
Beneath the tinted rosy west,
My blessed Lord will say ""Well Done"",
And I shall enter into rest.

Some day, till then I'll watch and wait,
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,
That when my Saviour opens the gate,
My soul to Him may take its flight."

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
Say what may the tidings be;
Which inspire your heav'nly song?

Verse 3
Come to Bethlehem and see,
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

With us sing our Savior's birth."

In bridal step along the way we are treading.

A super-race we are in the perfect rest of God.

CHORUS
Oh, that Angel with the swept-back wings,
He's the One that means the most.
He took us in the Inner Veil,
To reveal Himself more privately.
Here we are in perfect step,
In the promises of God.
Oh that Angel with the swept back wings,
He's the One that means the most.

All honour and glory and praise to His Name,
For He was found worthy to take the Book,
And show us our names.
Flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone,
In harmony we stand,
In God's provided place,
In the Seventh Seal of God.

The Seven Spirits in Revelation,
Is that notable Angel,
Who brought back the keys
To open the Third Pull.
Came back shouting ""Grace, Grace, Grace!
For I, JESUS, am the Word of God,
That is in your midst right now."""

It was after the Lord had descended with a shout
It was after the Seventh Seal was opened
And we know the sacrifice has been accepted

And He's sounding forth his message throughout the lands
It's to take us back to where we fell from
We could stand in our true position
We hear the Trumpet sounding jubilee

CHORUS
Don't you hear the Trumpet sound
This Message is clear and strong
I've thrown away my hoe and hammer
No longer serving no slave master
I hear the Trumpet sounding jubilee

It was after the second cycle had returned
And the second-fold mystery of the
Seventh Seal had made been known
It was after we had seen our names in the scripture
Shows Almighty God is our Father
We hear the Trumpet's sounding jubilee

Now we can stand in that liberty
By which Jesus Christ has made us free
No longer would we stay in bondage
We are going back to our heritage
Because the Trumpet's sounding jubilee

Don't you hear the Trumpet sound
This message is clear and strong
Don't you be like Johnny crow
The Lord has set you free, then go
Because the Trumpet's sounding jubilee

In that we've been released we can return
For all that Adam lost has been restored
Fellowship, full dominion, power over all creation
Because the Trumpet's sounding jubilee

Everything that's promised we can claim
Those Seven thundering voices restored the Name
Until even when we hear that last Trumpet sound
We are going to change dimension
Because the Trumpet's sounding jubilee"

94;Apply The Faith;;"What you've got locked up deep inside
God's gene placed there for this final ride
You have the faith for your victory
You can move mountains if you'll only believe
If you are living in captivity
And there seems to be no way out
my friend,
God's word has set you free

CHORUS
Apply the faith that God has given you
You don't have to be defeated
God's word will see you through
Stand and proclaim in Jesus Name
Your promised inheritance
So if the enemy still comes in like a flood
Tell him your sins they are all under the blood

Now we're no longer under the law
No longer in the enemy's claw
For the faith came so we could be justified
For all of our sins Christ was crucified
For we have the key to all the enemy's schemes
Seven seals have been revealed
Now stand and proclaim your liberty"
95;Are You Looking For Him;;"Verse1
There was a man in Jerusalem Simeon by name
Awaiting the consolation of Israel
And it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost
That he would not see death
Till he see the Lord's Christ the Anointed Word

Verse1
Led by the Spirit he came into the temple one day
And Jesus was brought in as was the custom of the law
Simoen took him up in his arms
And he bless yes he bless the God of heaven
Cause what he has been looking for
He now held in his possession

CHORUS
Are you looking for Him
He hath appeared and yet will appear
To us who look for Him
He'll appear another time

Verse2
After dark denominational ages seven to be precise
We saw a vision of Angels and it testified of a risen Christ
It's been about two thousand years
Since he give us that word
That as He ascended in like manner he will return

Verse2
T'was February 28th 1963
A cloud appeared 27 miles high 30 miles across
This truly fulfilled Hebrews 9 and 28
He appeared again having attained full redemption for you and me

Verse3
Our prophet suffered 42 long years
For deliverance he prayed he cried he was so distressed
The doctors told him he'll never be well
But that was as far as medical science could tell
He once saw a vision of what went wrong
But he also heard a voice saying it's only six inches long


Verse3
Mama's dream showed six doves but that was incomplete
For it was the 7 th  dove he really, really long to see
And it was early one morning when he awoke
And he saw his deliverance in a vision that broke
He went up the Catalina in obedience to that voice
Where he saw his dead enemy and that 7th dove
And this is what he said

As a son of Abraham I consider not what the doctor said
We know surely God give him his full deliverance

CHORUS
Brethren think about that situation you are faced with even now
Call to remembrance the word God spoke through His servant
Your enemy is dead he's still dead, Redemption message of Grace
Has come to us on the wings of that 7 th dove
Now exercise thy faith for there's power in true confession
Break through all hindrances into the supernatural
And experience the results that follows angelic visitations
For surely He's here to met your great expectations"
96;Are You She;;"I slipped through the gates of pearl,
As Peter greeted me.
And one by one I met the saints,

I heard them speak to me.

Who stood the worst of times,
When so many slipped away?
Here's your crown, take your place beside the Throne.
Christ is now your very own.
Is this the special chosen one we see?
Are you she?

It was the worst of all the ages they continued to say.
How did you live a Christian life,
In such a Godless day?
Question after question, my heroes lifted me.
Then I heard a Voice behind me, whisper tenderly.

Chorus
This is she, the bride of the last days.
Who stood the worst of times,
When so many slipped away.
Here's your crown.  Take your place beside My Throne.
I Am now your very Own.

This is she!

These trials that you're facing,
May seem so big and tall.
But when we hear the Master speak,
It'll make it worth it all.

When you go down in the waters
Of the saints you believe in what you heard
It's not impossible dream
You can start over clean
When you're washed by the waters of the word.

CHORUS
Are you washed by the waters
Washed by the waters of the word

It's like being born again
With a whole new life to live
Never having to look back to what you've been
Cause according to the Lord
You just started your existence and where he can say
There never was no sin.
For when God looks your way
He no longer sees a sinner but a saint
Who've been washed white as
It's not by anything you've done
But by the blood of God's own son
Are washed by the waters of the word."

He ever lives above,
For me to intercede;
His all redeeming love,
His precious blood, to plead:
His blood atoned for all our race,
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

Five bleeding wounds He bears;
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers;
They strongly plead for me:
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Forgive him, Oh forgive,"" they cry,
""Nor let that ransomed sinner die!""

The Father hears Him pray,
His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away,
The presence of His Son;
His Spirit answers to the blood,

And tells me I am born of God.

He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear:
With confidence I now draw nigh,

And I remember how You came and delivered me.

Exercising the faith of God

rolled away,
It was there by faith,

He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin.

The debt of love I owe:

We will live in His glory;
And in His likeness we'll be.

All our signs and our seasons
are mileposted there,
So the demons of reasoning
Would give up in despair;
We have claims of assurance,
The Abstract Title Deed;
It's the land of our Fathers,
And we are true seeds.

Come and be baptized

And forevermore abide.

There is but one Church,

And into it we're all baptized;
By the one, true,
promised Holy Spirit;
Though by the world we're
all despised.

Every creed
has claimed to be the Body,
But the ""plumb line"" proved untrue
All their dreams,
for God has so determined
To bring His Son's true Bride to view.

Many thought
that they were in the Body,
'Till the Holy Ghost had come;
When the Word of God
was opened to them,
They entered in,
and yet there's room.

Came upon us from on high,
May, by faith with Saints
of old departed,
Arise to meet Him in the sky.

And your vessel

If you do not walk in the light."

I have seen Him in the watchfires
of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on."

What can a man do to be justified?
What does it take for an angry God to be pacified?
If you trust in your power, or struggle with all your might,
Yet your righteousness is like filthy rags in God's sight.

What a work of grace that a man could clearly see
The Lamb with seven horns and seven eyes,
When darkness covers the earth and death begins to strike
In the place where the blood has not been applied!

Is it sufficient?  Then, don't add or take away;

Lifting us from a life of sin, turning our bodies heavenly.

They called Him Jesus,
He came to love,

Because He lives,
I can face tomorrow,
Because He lives,
all fear  is gone,
Because I know
He holds the future,
And life is worth the
living just because He lives.

And then one day
I'll cross that river,
I'll fight life's final war with Him,
And then as death
gives way to victory,
I'll see the light of glory
for I know He reigns.

How sweet to hold
A newborn baby
And feel the pride
And joy He gives
But greater still
The calm assurance
This child can face Uncertain days
Just because He lives

And then in our day,
God sent His prophet,
Just as He promised
that He would send
To prepare a bride for
this end time message,
And Christ in me is there
to prove that His Word still lives."

If any man hear my voice and open the door
I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me

Yes it
Knocking at the door of Laodicea at the end time
Yes its Jesus
Outside the church that claims to have his name

When the Lord came down on mount Sunset
And revealed himself as the Word of God
The seven seals that was opened up
By the seventh Angel to prepare the bride

The denominations refused to take
That revelation of the word of God
They rejected Jesus the word of God
The revelation of the seven seals

But instead they took that Word of God
Beyond the camp and there, they crucified Him
Upon their pulpits his new Golgotha
With creed and dogmas, There they crucified Him

Now let us go beyond the camp,
and there receive the Lord
Now lets come out of denominations,
For Jesus is calling for you"
150;Behold I Will Send You Elijah;;"Behold I will send you, Elijah the Prophet
Before the great and dreadful day(X2)

And He shall turn the heart of fathers to their children
And the heart of their children to their fathers
Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse

But in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel
When He shall begin to sound
The mystery of God should be finished
As He hath declared to His servants the prophets

I believe, I believe in the word of the Lord
That the Lord will keep His promise forever
That every scripture will someday be fulfilled

I believe, I believe in the promise of the Lord
That the Lord hath send Elijah the prophet
To restore

I believe I believe in the promise of the Lord
That the Lord hath sent the seventh Angel
To prepare"
151;Behold The Judge;;"
Bro Bill walked up one sunday morning with a Bible in hand,
And a magazine under his arm.
He greeted the church with a 'howdy-do' but his heart must skipped a beat,
Or two for what he was to bring.
You see God had come down, in a cloud of white on a mountain top,
in the evening time showed His face William Branham Said:

Chorus
Behold the Judge in cloud of white
Just turn the photography to the right
Can you see His nose, can you see His eyes?
Behold Our Lord on Mount sunset.


A supernatural shape up in the air where no cloud could ever from,
God formed a cloud up there.
Modern science cannot explain how the photography a cloud
A CLOUD THAT HAS NO RAIN.
You see God had come down in a cloud of white on a mountain top,
in the evening time showed His face, William Branham Said:

Bridge
May 17,1963
A cloud appeared in Life Magazine
The world did not know, just what it meant,
But to the Bride of Christ, it was God-sent."
152;Behold The Lamb;;"About two thousand years ago
When John was on the earth,
Sent by God to pave the way
For the Saviour of this world:
And as he introduced the Messiah
To the people there,
When he saw Jesus coming unto Him,
This is what He said.

CHORUS
""Behold the Lamb
Who taketh away the sin of this world!""
Behold the Lamb
Has taken away,  has taken away my sin.

Israel suffered serpent stings
When they provoked the Lord,
God's mercy caused the brazen serpent
To be lifted up;
And as for healing, it was lifted
In the wilderness,
So Jesus Christ was lifted
So we could look and live.

In the beginning was the Word,
Then, taking fleshly form,
Was manifested through
Jesus Christ
And lifted  on the cross:
And through the opening of those Seven Seals
We see so plain,
Just for our redemption, He's lifted up again."
153;Behold The Third Woe;;"Verse 1
The Kings of the earth and their armies
Are gathered in the valley of Meggido,
Where the grapes of God's wrath
Would be trampled,
The vats of blood will overflow;
So be not partakers my brothers;

Verse 1
In Beltshazzar's drunken feast,
For his subjects are all deformed
Into the image of the Beast;
But stand like Daniel
With your garments undefiled,
Knowing that Christ in you
Must be glorified.

CHORUS
For behold the third woe cometh quickly,
It's an urgent cry,
Apply the token or die.
For behold the third woe cometh quickly,
It's an urgent cry,
Apply the token or die.

Verse 2
Ecological crisis
Is filling men's heart with fear,
With the ozone layer being destroyed,
Divers earthquakes are everywhere;
But isn't it written in the scripture
The Heaven shall depart like a scroll

Verse 2
Thus saith the Lord
It's exactly what the prophets foretold;
But stand like Micaiah,
Stay with the seventh seal vision
You just say what Elijah already did say.

Verse 3
Now demons in the atmosphere
Are pressing their way
Into the hearts of men
Who are marked by God
For their iniquity
In rejecting the prophet
Whom God has sent;

Verse 3
The slaughtering angels are ready
To slay the young and the old,
So watch the cares of this life,
Remember Lot's wife
Who for vanity lost her soul;

Verse 3
Stand like Rahab
With your token on display,
For the destroying Angels
Are already on their way.
But stand like Daniel
With your garments undefiled;

Stand like Micaiah,
Stay with the seventh seal vision;
Stand like Rahab
With your token on display;
For the destroying Angels
Are already on their way."

And his name we shall declare

Behold I have made you the desire of all nations
A city of truth O Jerusalem
As I have declared to my servants the prophets

Your gates shall all stand strong again
I am the Lord your God thy strength
And though a host encamped around you
It shall not come nigh unto you
For I will destroy them all

for faith to take a hold
A place where you can anchor your soul
And when you live there
and be still and wait
Then faith operates When
you believe from the heart

Its not impossible to believe those things
you speak you will receive
it's  by inspiration, not what you think
or what you feel
it's God sovereign will when
you believe from the heart

From the heart you
can face the whole wide world
From the heart there is a certain call
From the heart there is a deep
that burns when
you confess and go forth
From the heart you'll have
the spoken word
From the heart you can speak a whole new world
From the heart you'll have a word that is sure
When you confess and go forth

Expect to see your kinsman on the scene
Expect to see your redeemer on the scene
Expect to see Jesus on the scene"

I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the
noonday heat,
And the burden of the day.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart
with tears,
Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love
And my own worthlessness.

I take, Oh cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross."

My Savior comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by the hand,
For this is heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from eververnal trees,
And flow'rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody.
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song."

There's been this deep and inward hunger
To see my Saviour,
And if I don't see You, Lord,
I just don't  know what I will do,
For You're the only one to see me through.

Oh, I'm travailing in birth

Travailing in birth and pain to be delivered;
Oh, I'm travailing in birth
And pain to be delivered,
To manifest the living Christ,

So as I have seen Thee in the sanctuary;
Thy loving-kindness is better than life,
My lips shall praise Thee all of my life;
You've put this deep within me
So that I will thirst for Thee,
You've placed this desire within my soul;
My soul followeth hard after Thee,
Thy right hand upholdeth me.

There appeared a great wonder in Heaven,
A woman clothed with the sun
Standing on the moon,
And upon her head a crown of twelve stars,
And before her stood a dragon;

comes in like a flood
My God will always lift a standard,
For no weapon formed against me

And every tongue that rises
I will condemn forever."

He's just as great today
As He was yesterday.

In the midst of the night,
We saw an amber-coloured Light,

For they see the things of God
That were spoken by the
Prophet in our day
They were hidden from the wise
And revealed to those who'd learn
I'm so glad He touched my eyes
That I might see!

Now the Sword of the King
It didn't miss a single thing
As It cut away the veil before my eyes
God is true to His Word
And the Message we have heard
I'm so glad He touched my eyes
That I might see

All the mysteries of God
Are revealed, they're open wide
Jesus came to earth to tell them
To His Bride
And He promised in His Word
That we would never ever part
Because He'd write His precious
Word upon our hearts."

Blessed assurance,
all is well
Things may seem impossible
but I know God cannot fail
Just look back and see how
many times you were at your end,
And God delivered you with
His mighty hand
Blessed assurance, all is well

verse 1
You have considered me
when the world despised me,
You have purchased me when
I thought I couldn't be loved,
Lord I just want to say
how much I love You,
I lift my hands praise Your name,
For I know all of Your promises,
You will fulfill.

verse 2
You may be believing for
your unsaved loved ones,
For total healing when the doctor
says nothing else can be done,
But my Redeemer's the Physician,
His report says it's a finished work,
So claim every inch of ground the
devil stole from you,
all in God's Name.

To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God:
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Though I've wandered far from His fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than the snow,
Whiter than the snow;
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o'ercame;
Grievous were the sorrows he bore,
But He suffered thus not in vain.
May I to that fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below;
Wash me in the blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me-
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."

Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,

And hope to meet again."

To await the Messiah

To seek, to kill and destroy

In the valley of Jehoshaphat

As the Lion is roaring
Their economy it has failed
And their kingdoms are falling
But we receive another kingdom
We live by God
In this famine
Watch it provide and create

Given a crown of twelve stars
We
It will bring up the sleeping ones
Our bodies shall be change
And on the wings of a great eagle
We will take our flight to the skies
United with him forever, we shall reign

To redeem and restore
Behold the Lord is in Zion

At harvest time for a visitation
As He arrived at the field

A beautiful flower
like the lily of the fields
Ruth the Moabite

CHORUS
A story of love started in the fields
At harvest time between Ruth and Boaz
A story of hearts that are bound forever
At adoption time
Boaz and Ruth the Moabite

Instructions were given to the harvest chief
For her to be looked after
This Gentile daughter
For right there in the field at harvest time
For so much love in His heart
He felt for her

At any cost to redeem her
This beautiful lady
That's what He thought about
since love at first sight
Right there in the fields at adoption time
Forevermore she would be His bride
Eternally she would bear a New Name

A great story of love
Between me and my Saviour
A story of hearts
Bound for eternity"

At the chickens picking on the ground
And something inside kept telling me
I was not earth bond

What's the matter with you
Why do you live in a dream
You are an eagle
You were born to fly

CHORUS
Now I'm flying where no other bird can fly
In a supernatural atmosphere high in the sky
Seeing things that I've never seen
He is taking me places I've never been
And the higher I go is the more I see
I'm now living in the reality
I'm an eagle
I was born free

Higher and higher I rise each day
I'm rising to a perfect faith
Rising on a mighty rushing wind
Rising above the rhythm of the music
Rising above the clapping of hands
Rising above the joy of the saints

deceive me
But then God sent His Word to me
He delivered me
And he's given me a law inside to fly
And soon I'll soar through heaven's door"

Lord, you know I need a brand new touch,
my strength from yesterday is gone
But if You'll give me, Lord, another touch,
I'll have the strength to carry on

I thought the sun had come to stay,
but all too soon it went away
And in it's place the storm clouds came,
and with the clouds there came the rain
It rained so hard and oh, so long,
beneath the storm I felt a calm
It was Your touch that brought me through it all,
without Your help I'd surely fall

But it matters not what comes my way, Lord,
if you'll just touch me new each day
Your loving touch drives all my fears away,
close by Your side I want to stay
Chorus:

Lord, You know how weak I really am,
oh, even better than myself
But with Your help I know I really can,
make it through the darkest night
Everything's gonna be all right!

The power of Satan breaking;
Our peace eternal making.

Verse 2
He comes a Child, from realms on high,

He comes in deep humility;
His people to deliver,
And reign in us forever."

To me, To me,
As Thou didst bless
The bread by Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My All in All.

Only for Thee,
As Thy disciples lived in Galilee;

Then, victory won,
I shall behold Thee, Lord,
The living One."

The bride she has to go
The rocks has been thrown up in
The sign, the plagues to follow
The pale horse rider unites them
To the great and final woe
But the bride she
The token is on the door.

Jezebel and Ahab united
Resurrection faith increasing
(Rise and Shine oh
Though the squeeze is starting
We feel the third pull super anointing

Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze,

The Word made flesh again
The Son of Man is reveal in our day
Same sign and wonders he did show
And still again they crucify the Word
But we believe Him
And hold fast to His Word
To us His mercy He did show

We know the price has been paid
The Lord is calling us by our name
Calvary means so much to me
Every devil in here must flee
So rejoice with me New Jerusalem
Soon we'll see the One we love"

As the wrath of God descend

Whom the Son of Man had sent
And chose instead a ruthless beast
Who's is destined to the pit

Step by step out of mortality
Into eternal realms I'll rise
Where death will be swallowed up by life
I'll live and never die
Timeless life of love and peace
Beholding my saviour's hallowed face
Cause I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
Who paid my debts for me
And He promised I'll be changed to immortality

And caught up in the sky
Where time will cease and death will die
The sleeping saints I'll greet in the skies
One of these days when time shall be no more
I'll soar with the wings of an eagle

Beholding the glory of a perfect man in likeness  of the most high
Walking the stairway he bypassed before and the door he never
Into a city built with lively stones, the streets built transparent gold
Cause I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
Who chose me as His own
And He promised I'll sit with him on His established throne

252;Christ Is The Mystery Of God Revealed;;"Christ is the mystery of God revealed x2
For in Him dwelleth the fulness of God
Christ is the mystery of God revealed
For He was God in human flesh

God had a secret before the world began
A threefold purpose which now has been revealed
He wanted to reveal Himself to man
And to have the preeminence in you and me
His Bride
And to restore the Kingdom back

{He is the principle theme of the Bible
From Genesis to Revelation
The Law and the prophets, the Psalms and the Kings
Every chapter and every verse
He's the centre of revelation} x2

{He's the principle theme of my life
He's the principle theme of my thinking
The principle theme of my talking
The principle theme of my singing
He's everything to me.} x2

{Let Him have the preeminence in all my life
The second fold purpose which God had in His mind
Let Him have the preeminence in all, in all my life
Until the Bride and Bridegroom shall go back to Eden
To live forever and forever and ever and God's purpose shall be done}
x3"
253;Christ Revealed;;"The promise of the Lord is now at hand,
And in the love of God, O there she stands;
That Super-race the Lord has spoken to,
""Thus saith the Lord, she's in plain view.""

Our beloved prophet cried to see our day,
When the beloved Bride of God will show the way,
Today, here stands the Bride becoming Christ;
Passing every Bridal test into perfect rest.

Elisha surely saw Elijah go,
And he got a double part of grace to know;
So nothing will stand in God's Bride's way,
For she saw Elijah go along the way.

The mystery is God in our flesh,
And veiled behind our skins, that is the test;
Stumbling the world with its simpleness,
For we now see that we are the Messiahettes.

The enemy is running on every hand,
All heaven is amazed, God's mystery grand;
Those seven thunders saying ""Christ is
Now Jesus Christ and Bride united stand."

thus obeying Christ's command,
For the master called to them,
""Come and dine;""

desire,
Bread and fish upon the fire;
Thus He satisfies the hungry

And with Jesus they will feast
eternally."

His witness through believers won the lost
As multitudes were born again
The early Christians scattered o'er the world
They preached the gospel fearlessly
Though some were martyred and to lions hurled
They marched along in victory.

CHORUS
Come Holy Spirit dark is the hour
We need your filling your love and your mighty power
Move now among us, stir us we pray
Come Holy spirit revive your church today

Then in an age when darkness grip the earth
The just shall live by faith was learnt
The Holy Spirit gave the church new birth as reformation fires burn
In later years the great revival came
When saints would seek the Lord and pray
Oh, once again we need that Holy flame
To meet the challenge here today."

268;Come Let Us Stand;;"Who are we children,
And what were we born to be?
Not just mortal creatures of time
But reflectors of eternity.
Why were we placed here
Amidst temptation sore?
It's to develop our character,
And prove we're worthy of the Cross.

CHORUS
Come let us stand together
on God's Word.

We belong to a body, to a unit
so unique,
Every member is important,
From the head down to the feet.
Everyone is affected
When one goes out of place,
So let's take our places faithfully,
Let's strive to keep the faith.

We've got to recognize
The deposit of the Word,
That God has placed within us
To face this evil world;
The skills that we've been blessed with,
And the natural ability,
Are like seeds and when planted
Will bring forth abundantly.

BRIDGE

For we were made overcomers
Through Jesus Christ;
And this is the victory,
That overcomes the world - even our faith."
269;Come Morning;;"God's children so long have been waiting,
They're longing for heaven's bright shore
Where troubles are left far behind us,
And burdens are carried no more.

CHORUS
Come morning I'll walk by the river,
I'll rest 'neath the evergreen tree;
I'll carry my cross till the midnight,
Come morning there's glory for me.

Sometimes I'm despised and  rejected,
And I question, ""Oh Father, how long?""
Then I take one more look at Mt. Calvary
And it gives me the strength to go on."

Come, Thou fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace.
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
Mount of God's unchanging love.

Verse 2
Here I raise my Ebenezer;
Hither by Thy help I come.
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wand'ring from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

Verse 3
Oh, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let thy grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee:
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love.
Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.

Verse 4
Hither to Thy love has blest me;
Thou hast bro't me to this place;
And I know Thy hand will bring me
Safely home by Thy good grace.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Bought me with His precious blood."

Raise us to Thy glorious throne."

And drink everlasting life."
274;Come To The Waters;;"CHORUS
He said come to the waters
And stand by my side
And drink from the fountain
You won't be denied
I have seen every tear drop
That fell from your eyes
And I rose to tell you for your sins I've died

He's calling for the sinners and the backsliders too
If you need deliverance He'll do it for you
He died on the cross but now He's alive
And He rose to tell you for your sins He died

He's calling for the sick and He's calling for the lame
If you don't be healed then He's not to blame
For He died on the cross but now He's alive
And He rose to tell you for your pain He died

He's calling for the motherless and the fatherless to
No sister or no brother to care for you
For He died on the cross but now He's alive
And He rose to tell you for your joy He died"
275;Come Unto Me;;"Hear the blessed Savior
calling the oppressed,
""Oh ye heavy-laden, come
to Me and rest;
Come, no longer tarry,
I your load will bear,
Bring Me ev'ry burden,
bring Me ev'ry care.""

Chorus
Come unto Me,
I will give you rest;
Take My yoke upon you,
Hear Me and be blest;
I am meek and lowly,
Come and trust My might;
Come, My yoke is easy,
And My burden's light.

Are you disappointed,
wand'ring here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt
and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle
in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus,
He will give you rest.

Stumbling on the mountains
dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling tow'rd the pit
of hell's consuming flame,
By the pow'rs of sin
deluded and oppressed,
Hear the tender Shepherd,
""Come to Me and rest.""

Have you by temptation
often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness
brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you,
if you'll claim His best,
In the Holy Spirit,
He will give you rest."
276;Come What May;;"He didn't say that it was going to be easy;
Every promise my Lord has made
We've got to fight to claim.
For as many as He called,
He gave the power to overcome;
And every devil that stands before us
Must be on the run!
So why should I ever think it strange
When fiery trials should come my way?
For He said that if I do suffer for His Name,
With Him I shall reign.

CHORUS
Come what may, with Your Word I will stay,
Come what may, I'll press through anyway;
Come what may, Lord have Your  way.

I'll consider Him
Who for the joy that was set before Him,
The cross He endured;
And that same life now dwelleth within me
Victory I'm assured.
For He did say, He'll never leave me nor forsake me,
And as a seed of Abraham
I'll possess the gates of my enemies!
Why should I ever think it strange
When fiery trials should come my way?
For He said that if I do suffer for His Name
With Him I shall reign.

As I journey along,
May Lord I ever be, courageous and strong;
For inch by inch I'll possess the
land
For I'm a journeyman,
By striving lawfully,
Knowing Thou savourest reverence and humility;
Let the fullness of that meal offering
Be displayed in me!
I should never ever think it strange
When fiery trials should come my way,
For You said that if I do suffer for Your Name,
With You I shall reign.

When I am down on the ground,
May I press through like a lily
In spite of the muck all around;
Rejoicing in the glory wherein You have clothed me.
When I am up in the air
And the strong winds blow,
May I ever know that You are there;
But if I be like a wounded dove,
May I press through with Your message of Love.
For I no longer ever think it strange
When fiery trials should come my way;
For I know that if I do suffer for Your Name
Lord, with You I shall reign."

Wholesome grain and pure may be.

Verse 3
For the Lord our God shall come,

But the fruitful ears to store
In His garner evermore.

Oh Lord, you have showed me such love,
All I have I surrender to you."

I've come into union with you
I've found full redemption."
282;Consider Him;;"I have to sing to you
About the One who died for me,
Even though I've failed,
Yet His Love's still being
In my time of trial and when the enemy assails,
I draw back just for a little while
To consider Him.

CHORUS
Consider Him who for the joy endured the cross,
Consider Him who died for all
Consider Him who there on Calvary bore your pain,
I want you just for a little while
To consider Him.

I know that life is rough, sometimes the trials hard to bear,
And your daily life is encumbered with a load of care;
Then there are those times when you can't seem to bear the strain,
I want you just for a little while
To consider Him."
283;Conversation;;"In the beginning God created man.
In His own image, formed by His own hand.
Satan, oh Satan, he tempted man to fall.
He had to find a sacrifice, to die once and for all....to die once and for all.

So He sent His Son to die, oh the pain He bore.
They laid Him in a borrowed tomb, the stone held fast the door.
Saints all tell the story, I'm about to tell,
about a conversation from the pits of hell....from the pits of hell.

(Satan) Tell me, Death tell me--Oh Death, hear my plea--do we still have Jesus, or did you set him free? This is now the first day, they've laid him in the ground. Tell me, Oh Death tell me--can you hold him down? Can you hold him down?

(Death) Satan, oh Satan, Satan hear me well--I promise, oh I promise, that I shall not fail...That I shall not fail

(Satan) Tell me, Death tell me--this is the second day. Do you still have Jesus or did he get away?  Did he get away?

(Death) Satan, Oh Satan--hear me now, once more--The greatest kings and rich men have walked through my dark door. This Jesus, he's no different, he's just a mortal man, and I make this vow to you--He won't escape my hand--no--He won't escape my hand!

(Satan) Tell me, Death, tell me....Tell me don't be slow. Do you still have Jesus or did you let him go? He's been dead for three days, the victory's been won--it's time for celebration--We've overcome God's Son.... We've overcome God's Son!!

Death) Satan, oh Satan, hear me what I say....This morning, OH this morning, the stone was rolled away!! I just couldn't stop him--I couldn't hold him down. With power oh great power, He arose up from the ground!!  He arose up from the ground!!!

(All)

He has risen (he has risen) He has risen (he has risen)
Oh Death where is thy sting?
He has risen (he has risen) He has risen (he has risen)
Oh, proclaim Him King of Kings!

He has risen (he has risen) He has risen (he has risen)
OH, He lives forever more!
He has risen (he has risen) He has risen (he has risen)
Oh, proclaim Him Lord of Lords!
proclaim Him Lord of Lords!
"
284;Count The Cost;;"Verse1
If I had many more I would
give them all to Him
I owe my whole life to Jesus
If i had a thousand more,
that
I
He did not hesitate to do
this work for me.

Verse1
My kinsman Redeemer.
He bought full and
complete redemption
He considered the cost.
What it would take to free my soul
Came down from his glory
and made a way back to the tree of life

CHORUS
Count the cost of what Jesus
did for you and me
Count the cost of what Jesus did for you
and me at calvary
Count the cost as he left His home in glory,
redemption story for you and me
Count the cost as He left His throne on high,
came down to die for you and me
(paid the perfect price for you and me)

Like Ruth coming out of
a broken barren life,
I came in to the house of God
Though I be a stranger,
I followed the voice inside.
I was instructed, to the feet of the
One who would change my life

Verse2
So I laid my claim upon the
word which I was thought
With all my heart I believe for
He hath proven faithful before
With a promise that He would not rest
until its done
He did exactly as was promised oh lord!
I could never repay such love

Bridge
On easter morning He rose from the grave
Restoring access to the Tree of life"
285;Count Your Blessings;;"Chorus 1
Count your blessings
Name them one by one.

See what God hath done.
Count your blessings
Name them one by one.
And it will surprise you
What God hath done.

Verse 1
When upon life's billows
You are tempest tossed,
When you are discouraged
Thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done.

Verse 2
Are you ever burdened
With a load of care,
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear.
Count your many blessings
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing
As the days go by.

Verse 3
When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold.
Count your many blessings
Money cannot buy,
Your reward in heaven
Nor your home on high.

Verse 4
So amid the conflict
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged
God is over all.
Count your many blessings
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you
To your journey's end."

290;Cow Boy's Meditation;;"Verse 1
Last night as I laid on the prairie
I gazed to the stars in the skies
And I wondered if ever a cowboy
Could drift to that sweet bye and bye

Chorus
There is a road to that bright, happy Region
But it's dim there, a trail , so they say,
But the broad one that leads to perdition
Is posted and blazed all the way.

Verse 2
They speak of another great Owner,
And He's never overstocked, so they say
He'll always make room for a sinner
That will drift on that straight, narrow way

Verse 3
They say He'll never forsake you,
And He knows every action and look;
For safety we'd better get branded,
Have our name on His great tally Book

Verse 4
For they say there will be a great roundup
When cowboys like dogies will stand
To be marked by the riders of judgement,
That's posted and knows every brand

Verse 5
I guess I won't be a stray yearling,
Just a man that's condemned to die
That will be cut in the bunch with the rustics,
When the Boss of those riders come by."
291;Create In Me A Clean Heart;;"Create in me
a clean heart, Oh God
And renew a right spirit

The joy of Thy salvation
{And renew a right spirit
within me.} x2"
292;Crown Him With Many Crowns;;"Verse 1
Crown Him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His throne.
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own!
Awake, my soul and sing
Of Him who died for Thee;
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity.

Verse 2
Crown Him the Lord of love:
Behold His hands and side,
Rich wounds, yet visible above,
In beauty glorified;
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downwards bends His wondering eye
At mysteries so bright.

Verse 3
Crown Him the Lord of life,
Who triumphed o'er the grave.
Who rose victorious to the strife,
For those He came to save.
His glories now we sing,
Who died and rose on high.
Who died eternal life to bring,
And lives that death may die.

Verse 4
Crown Him the Lord of peace,
Whose pow'r a scepter sways
From pole to pole,
That wars may cease
And all be prayer and praise;
His reign shall know no end,
And round His pierced feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet.

Verse 5
Crown Him the Lord of years,
The Potentate of time;
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou hast died for me.
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity.

Verse 6
Crown Him the Son of God
Before the worlds began,
And ye, who tread where He hath trod,
Crown Him the Son of man;
Who every grief hath known
That wrings the human breast,
And takes and bears them for His own,
That all in Him may rest.

Verse 7
Crown Him the Lord of heaven:
One with the Father known,
One with the Spirit
Through Him given
From yonder glorious throne.
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity."
293;Crucified One;;"Lord where would I be, if you had not gone
On that lonely hill to dark Calvary
What is man that a king would leave His Glory above
And suffer in deep agony

Chorus
I owe my whole life to the crucified one
Who gave His all for me
With all that's in me I will praise His Holy Name
Praise God for the crucified one

He walked the lonely hill, with me in mind
I was wretched, naked and blind
My Lord was so great, only one could hang
Thank God for the crucified one"
294;Crying, Travailing;;"So often, I find myself slipping
In little things you may think,
""It doesn't matter""
But when I come into His holy presence
His life reveals my life
And shows me where I'm wrong.

Chorus
Crying, travailing
Oh Lord! hear I pray
Crying, travailing
Oh Lord!
Come take us home.

Oh this life on earth,
It's only a shadow
And the bride of Christ
Is longing for that morning
When the King of kings
Is coming in power
To see Him face to face
His glory we'll behold.

Day by day and with each passing moment,
Strength I find to meet my trials here;
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,
I've no cause for worry or for fear.
He whose heart is kind beyond all measure,
Give unto each day what He deems best;
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.

Verse 2
Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me,
He whose name is Counselor and Pow'r.
The protection of His child and treasure,
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
""As your days, your strength shall be in measure,""
This the pledge to me He made.

Verse 3
Help me then in ev'ry tribulation,
So to trust Your promises, O Lord;
That I lose not faith's sweet consolation,
Offered me within Your holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E'er to take, as from a Father's hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till I reach the promised land."

Wait and worship while the night
Sets her ev'ning lamps alight,

Of the universe Thy home;
Gather us who seek Thy face,
To the fold of Thy embrace

While the deep'ning shadows fall
Heart of love enfolding all,
Thro' the glory and the grace
Of the stars that veil Thy face;

Pass the stars the day;
The night Lord of angels,
On our eyes let eternal morning rise,

Still we are the voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord.

Behold He comes riding on the clouds,
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call,
Lift your voice  it's the year of jubilee,
Out of Zion's hill salvation comes.

The dry bones becoming as flesh;
And these are the days of Your servant David

And we are your labourers in your vineyard,

While I walk this earthly sod.

Humbly must I walk with Jesus
In the paths that He doth lead.
Never falter, never murmur
Always to His voice give heed.

Daily must I seek to please Him
Whether it bring joy or pain.
I shall know then just how blessed
Is the worth of Heav'nly gain.

In His likeness I shall come.
Where the saints of all the ages
Shall receive their welcome home."

In Thy precious, holy Word.

Take me deeper still,
Till my life is
Wholly lost in Jesus,
And His perfect will.

Deeper, deeper!
Though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the
Holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

Deeper, higher,
Every day in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqueror,
And in His own image
Perfected at last."

Reached down and picked me up,

To that evergreen shore,

Straight the way

To take His children to the Word

It won't help you to stand apart
Come and check It don't criticize,
Like the Pharisees and the Scribes
Please read in Malachi 4 vrs 5
Trully there the truth you'll surely find
Take you Bible,check It out

This prophet came to us with

As the voice spoke loud and clear"

CHORUS
Do you know your God in you
Then why do you doubt my words
When you know I can do
Do you know your God in you
To overcome this evil world
You have to know the God in you

When you look back to Calvary
What do you see
When you underestimate my words and my simplicity
And when the trials comes your way
Why do you doubt my words
When greater is the God in you than he who is in the world

I predestinated you to manifest my word
Revealed my secrets unto you
But still you doubt my word
Raise above your unbelief
Put on your royal armour
Pray for revelation
You have to know your God

Why do you doubt my word
When you see what I can do
Do you know your God in you
To overcome this evil world
Do you know the God you serve"

every time I fail?
Can He hear a crowd cry crucify again,
Am I causing Him pain

Cause I just can
the thought of hurting him.

It seems that I

And that I treat His precious
Christ all so carelessly,
But each time He forgives
or what if he relives
The agony he felt on that tree

Too deeply for mirth or song;
As the burdens press,
And the cares distress,
And the way grows weary and long?

Chorus
O, yes, He cares; I know He cares;
His heart is touched with my grief:
When the days are weary, the long nights dreary,
I know my Saviour cares...

Does Jesus care when my way is dark,
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades
Into the deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near!

Does Jesus care when I
To resist some temptations strong;
When in my deep grief
I find no relief,
Tho

Does Jesus care when I
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches
Till it nearly breaks-
Is this aught to Him? Does He see?"

Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win,
To save my soul.

Revealed the hidden plan.

And has robbed me of my wealth

In You I put my confidence
So I'm placing my claim

Draw me closer and closer

Protected by God's hand;
Here the sun is always shinning,
Here there's naught can harm me

Dwelling in the spirit here,

Gladly will I tarry

350;Eternal Rest;;"Time's clock is striking the hour,
Jesus will soon descend,
Clothed in the garments of power,
The reign of sin to end.
Then will this anthem be ringing
Like to a mighty flood,
Then  'round the throne we'll be singing,
Glory and praise to God.

CHORUS
Glory, glory to God!
Thus will the ransomed sing;
Glory, glory to God,
The everlasting King!
Praise Him, alleluia!
To that eternal sphere
We are waiting for our translating;
The time is near.

In those bright mansions supernal,
Death cannot enter there;
Ages on ages eternal
His likeness we shall bear.
There will the once broken hearted
Rest in the spirit know;
Sorrow forever departed,
Gladness shall overflow.

Sighing forever is ended,
Foes shall oppress no more;
Voices in worship are blended
To Him whom all adore.
Bathed in the light soft and tender,
Sealed for eternity,
Praise to the Lamb we will render
Worthy of praise is He.

Beautiful, wonderful story!
Jesus Himself the light;
There in the kingdom of glory
Never shall fall the night.
Now I am singing of heaven,
While here I wage the strife;
Then will the victors be given
Crowns of eternal life."
351;Even Now;;"Verse1
There was nothing left,
just a little bit of oil that's what all she had,
the situation looked hopeless.
Life seemed empty,
the fire that she had was gone,
and she couldn't no longer sustain her family.
A widow with nothing,
she was a widow with nothing,
that was her story.

Verse2
With the creditors approaching,
in her most desperate time of need,
she stood all alone,

Verse2
They read their charges,
""You cannot pay your debt
Your children now become our ransom,
and they shall be taken.""
She cried, ""Lord I have nothing,
I'm a widow with nothing""
That was her testimony.

Verse3
BUT,
when God heard her desperate cries He came
He quickly came to her
as He heard the cries of His own.
He led her to find Elisha,
the Prophet for that hour.

Verse4
Go, Thus saith the Lord,
God has already told me
your troubles will be gone
the story of your life
will be different from now on,
bring every jar you can find, God will transform
the little oil that you have
will be multiplied even now, right now.

Verse4
Your children will never be slaves,
and you will never be in debt anymore.
God has chosen you
and in your home
He will work a paradox.

Verse5
In the house that was empty now has
the widow who was weeping can rejoice and
Where there was nothing
today you can have it all.
step out by faith and see God multiply your oil;

Verse6
Now your fire's burning,
shine your light each day
you touched the hem of His garment as he
All who saw you suffer at the hands of death,
Now see the blessings of the Lord
even now, right now."
352;Even So Come Lord Jesus;;"Modern event have become clear by vindicated prophecies
History is repeating itself on the earth
God and man are being united
Ahab and Jezebel they are married
Church and politics mixed together
As written in the Fourth seal
The world has rejected the voice
Of its messenger for the last days
They have sat and drank and eaten the food
Served from Jezebel Rome
But in the days when the towers fall
When God judge Ahab for his sins
Who is able to make war against Jezebel's false religion
There must be a people like Micaiah
Who'll look back to Elijah's word
And though the system comes to steal their lives
They can't deny God's word
And they will say

CHORUS
Even so come Lord Jesus
Even so come Lord
Even so come Lord Jesus
Even so come Lord Jesus

The world again is falling apart
And the signs are everywhere
Signs of famine, wars and pestilence
As man heart fail for fear
Disobedience brought their judgment
And rejection brought their curse
Yet once again man crucify the seed of God on earth
And there shall be another performance
Of all diabolical, cunningness and cruelty
As the vesture drips with blood
Yet the word must be fulfilled
And in the days when the towers fall
And the white horse rider rides
And the beast is given power
To steal kill and destroy
Yet there is a mighty people
Walking with the faith of God
Faith for healing faith for power
And translation in this hour"
353;Evening Light;;"And it shall come to pass in that day
That the light shall not be clear nor dark
But it shall be one day
Which shall be known unto the Lord
Not day nor night
But it shall come to pass
That at the evening time
It shall be light x 2

Do you know that light x 2
Are you walking in that light
Are you praying in that light
But at the evening time
It shall be light x 2

As the lightning shines
From the east to the west
So the Gospel has travelled
From the east to the west
From the rising of the sun
To the going down of the same
The name of the Lord
Shall be great among the Gentiles
Oh my brother this is the time
This is the time of the evening

This is the light to reveal the mysteries of God
This is the light of the Sun from the 7th star
This is the light of the Word from the 7th angel

This is the light to reveal the mysteries of God
The mystery of the seven stars
In the hand of the Lord
The mystery of the seven churches
And the Son of man
The mystery of the seven Spirits
On the Throne of God;

The mystery of the seven Thunders
And the mystery of the Seals
The mystery of Mystery Babylon
The mystery of the Beast
The mystery of the seed of the serpent
And the mystery of the Bride"
354;Evening Sacrifice;;"An evening sacrifice we offer,
At the end of this age
The prayers we lay upon the altar

Behind the inner veil

Lord we bring to You, an evening sacrifice
Lord we bring to You our free-will offering
The temple of our lives
And we come to You,
With true hearts we draw near
Let Your fire fall upon this altar here
Of sacrifice and prayer.

The coming of that seventh angel
Was to restore all things
The fulfillment of a divine promise
That God would dwell within
The super sign, invisible union
The restoration of all things
A people who would reign with Him forever
To a race of priests and kings

The door will close
Intercession's ending, under that seventh seal
The hidden plan of true redemption.
To the Bride is being revealed
The way into the Holy of Holies
To us is being unveiled
Access restored, dominion is given
To a people marked and sealed"

Lord, with every step I take, with every move I make,
Let Your Holy Spirit be my guide.
Let me always heed Your voice, when I have to make a choice,
I want Your perfect will for my life.

There are times we think we're right,
Think we have a green light.
But we find ourselves in God's permissive will.
But oh, what glory and what beauty, to be in the line of duty.
His perfect will always want to fill.

I don't every want to be caught, doing God a service without His will.
'Cause I know that He has a plan for me.  I know there are wonders to fulfill.

But by his grace
He made you his habitation
The Lord has build this house.

God has promise in this day

To be his tabernacle

Building his masterpiece to be like him
And we are the lively stones of this house
His workmanship unto good works
Glorifying our Father
God and us are now one.

Our hands are your hands
Our feet are your feet
Filled with your Holy Spirit
Now we are co workers with you
And with your word you lead us throughout the earth
To hunt out the missing stones that will build up this house
Lord now your house is complete.

It leaves our home so lonely

Living so wicked year after year.

Toils of the road will then seem

That He paid the price

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail
Does He hear the crowd cry
Crucify'm again
Am I causing Him pain
Then I know I've got to change
Cause I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

Seems that I'm so good
At breaking promises
That I treat His precious grace
So carelessly
That each time He forgives
What if He relieved
The agony He felt
On the tree

Does He still feel the nails
Every time I fail
Can He hear the crowd cry
Crucify'm again
Am I causing Him pain
Then I know I've got to change
Cause I just can't bear the thought
Of hurting Him

HOLY HOLY HOLY is the Lord
HOLY HOLY HOLY is the Lord

I never want to hurt You again

Each passing time
By putting on His love
And bowels of mercy,
And by grace put on
His humbleness on mine.

In my life
Till all my friends and loved ones
See me changing
Till they see no longer me

who are seeking
The pleasures earthly things
afford
But none can match the
wondrous treasures
That I find in Jesus Christ
my Lord

So my brother if the things

Leave a hunger that just
won't pass away
My blessed Lord will come
and save you
If you kneel to Him and
humbly pray

As the hart pants for the

So my soul is thirsting for
the Lord.

the Living God,
Fill my cup, feed my soul
with Thy Word."

my Saviour and Guide,
Let me never in darkness rove;
Keep my path
free from wrath,
and my soul satisfied,
Fill my way every day with love.

Soon the race

and I'll travel no more,
But abide in my home above;
Let me sing, blessed King,
all the way to the shore,
Fill my way every day with love."

And the earth fell into a chaotic condition
But the Spirit of God moved (Spirit of God moved)
He fluttered like a dove (Fluttered like a dove)
Bringing healing to this attribute of God
Yes the Spirit of God moved (Spirit of God moved)
He fluttered like a dove (Fluttered like a dove)
Transforming the earth into a beautiful Eden

CHORUS 1
Fluttering in (Fluttering in)
On the wings of love (On the wings of Love) 2x
The Lord coming down on the wings of a dove

This same God came in human skin
As the sacrificial Lamb to take away our sin
Subjected Himself to be washed by His Prophet
He said it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
The prophet looking up saw the heavens open
And he saw that Dove coming down like a fire

The prophet bore a sickness most of his life
For his own healing he begged and he cried
He looked for the time the Dove would appear
To take away his suffering his pain and his fear
That day he was led up the mountain high
He saw that seventh Dove he looked for all his life

CHORUS 2
Fluttering in (Fluttering in)
On the wings of love (On the wings of Love)
The Lord coming down in the form of a dove
Moving through the lattices (Moving through the lattices)
Can you see Him now (Can you see Him now)
The Lord coming down on the wings of a dove

The Bride too has suffered
Down through these years
But this faithful Dove once again has appeared
In this second ride He speaks to you and me
Have faith in His Word, He
Nothing is impossible for Him to do (For you and me)
He says

CHORUS 1
He was seen in a rainbow on a farm in Siparia
As a pillar of fire over in Guyana
In Central America the Cloud came down
Down in Argentina He came as a dove
The appearing of this Dove identified

Keep me close to the foot of the cross
I surrender my will
Whatever the cost
Draw me close let me see
Where you suffered and bled for me
Keep me close to the foot of the cross
Keep me close to the foot of the cross

All around me are those who have lost
The love for the saviour is cost
Help me dear Lord to reach them for thee
Lead them back to the foot of Calvary

Bridge
Your love led the way with the rugged cross
On a hill you died for my sin
Your suffering name paid the debt for all man
How great is your love toward me

Before you one day i will stand
And i will answer for the life for the life that i've lived
So lead me dear Lord and let me follow thee
Keep me close to the foot of Calvary
Keep me close
To the foot of the cross."
395;Footprints;;"One night I had a dream
I was walking on the beach
There were two sets of footprints in the sand

One belonged to me and the other to my Lord
He was walking close beside me
To heaven's land

But then I noticed my burdens I could hardly bear
Only one set of footprints in the sand
But You said Lord You would never leave me
So why are they alone
Just when I needed You most

He said I never left you alone along life's narrow way
I've been close beside you everyday
And when you saw one set of footprints on the beach
My child that's when I carried you"

For God so loved the world,
That He gave His only begotten Son,
That whosoever believeth in Him,
Whosoever believeth in Him,
Should not perish should not perish,
But have everlasting life.

Verse 1
A story sweet and wondrous,
Like heavenly music swells.
In chimings clear to all who will hear,
Ring out the gospel bells.

Verse 2
When, grieving brokenhearted,
Because of sin and shame,
We find a joy earth cannot destroy,
Believing on His name.

Verse 3
This love, beyond all measure,
Of earth or sea or sky,
Could only show its full overflow,
When Jesus came to die.

Come, brother come to Jesus,
His word was meant for you;
His grace receive, His promise believe,
And sing His praise anew."

From Calvary,
Come now and receive."
403;Four Days Late;;"verse 1
The news came to Jesus, ""Please
come fast!""
""Lazarus is sick and without your
help he will not last""
Mary and Martha, watched their
brother die
They waited for Jesus, He did not
come and they wondered why.

verse 1
The death watch was over, buried
four days
Somebody said, ""He'll soon be
here, the Lord's on His way""
Martha ran to Him, and then she
cried
""Lord if you had been here, You
could have healed him, he'd still be
alive""

chorus
But You're four days late
And all hope is gone
Lord we don't understand why you
waited so long
But His way is God's way
Not your's or mine
And isn't it great, when He's four
days late
He's still on time

verse 2
Jesus said ""Martha, show me the
grave""
But she said ""Lord, you don't
understand, he's been there four
days""
The grave stone was rolled back
Then Jesus cried ""Lazarus come
forth!""
Then somebody said ""He's alive,
he's alive!""

verse 2
We've heard a Voice crying
in this Midnight hour
Saying, Jesus is coming,
To gather together and raise up
His Own.
Some of us have met Him, And
We know it is true
Let's go and get the others,
The Master is come and calleth for
you.

verse 3
You may be fighting, a battle of
fear
You cried to the Lord, I need you
now
But He has not appeared
Friend don't be discouraged
'Cause He's still the same
He'll soon be here, He'll roll back
the stone
And He'll call out your name!

CHORUS 2
The Master is here
He's amongst us now
He's broken the Seal
And Calling your name
He is raising you now
No longer asleep,
But quickened and raised
United with Him
For He's the Resurrection & Life!
He's Always On Time"
404;Fourth Man In The Fire;;"Verse 1
The moment now has come,
There is nothing to be done,
My accuser stands before me and,
There is nowhere left to run,
And so it ends this way,
There is nothing more to say,

verse 1
I'll pay the prize,
And give my life,
For the choice that I have made;
Oh but suddenly,
What is this I see?
As I'm cast into the fire there,
Is One who stands by me

Chorus
I saw the fourth Man,
Between the flames and I,
When there was
no hope at all,
He saved me just in time,

Chorus
Holding back dark forces,
That pressed on every side
I am saved by the fourth Man
in the fire,
I am saved by the fourth Man
in the fire.

Verse 2
And now the test is past,
But it was not the last,
For my accuser seeks,
To find me weak,
And constantly attack,
Searching to and from,
Constantly their goal,

verse 2
And in my desperate hour,
Seek to devour,
And strike the faith of the Lord,
But I am not afraid;
Oh and they are much dismayed,
For between us stands,
The Son of Man,
And the standard He has raised.

Verse 3
Jesus fights for me,
In my hour of need,
Standing at my side,
And He's holding back the tide,
Where there was no hope at all,
He saved me just in time.

Bridge 1
And I saw the fourth Man,
Between the flames and I,
When there was no hope at all,
He saved me just in time;

Nothing now can harm me
With Jesus at my side,
I am saved by the fourth Man in the fire,
I am saved by the fourth Man in the fire.
Oh by the fourth Man in the fire.

I am saved by the fourth man in the fire;
I am saved by the fourth man in the fire;

That one so vile as I
Should ever have a friend

CHORUS
Friendship with Jesus,
Fellowship divine;
Oh, what blessed sweet
communion,
Jesus is a Friend of mine.

A Friend when other friendships
cease,
A Friend when others fail;
A Friend who gives me joy
and peace,
A Friend when foes assail.

A Friend to lead me in the dark,
A Friend who knows the way;
A Friend to steer my weak,
frail bark,
A Friend my debts to pay.

A Friend when sickness lays
me low,
A Friend when death draws near;
A Friend as through the vale I go,
A Friend to help and cheer.

A Friend when life's short race
is o'er.
A Friend when earth is past;
A Friend to meet on heaven's
shore,
A Friend when home at last."

408;From Death To Eternal Life;;"Outside in the world,
I had nowhere to go
The Holy Spirit came
And put me in the know
I was led right to the Word
And the Seed in my heart was sown
To give me life and show
That I'm a son of God

The lifestyle changed,
From natural to Spiritual
To put away everything that's carnal
And the only goal you see
Is to be perfect just like He
You feel the life,
Growing inside of you

Now the Truth and the Way I know
The growth of life,
In seven steps would show
That it's from faith to perfect love
Then God descends like a dove
To crown the man,
For attaining perfection

All the while this is what I see
Christ in you, is the mystery
To overcome this human flesh
That's the man that God would bless
Who overcomes,
I would grant to wear a crown

Saints I'm sure
In heaven is where I'll be
Praising God through eternity
The Holy Spirit, Christ in me,
I'm sure of victory
His Word, His will,
I'm sure would never fail"
409;From Every Stormy Wind;;"Verse 1
From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat:
'Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

Verse 2
There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all beside more sweet:
It is the Blood-bought mercy seat.

Verse 3
There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend.
Though sundered far by faith they meet
Around the common mercy seat.

Verse 4
Ah whither could we flee for aid,
When tempted desolate dismayed,
Or how the hosts of hell defeat,
Had suff'ring saints no mercy seat.

Verse 5
Ah there on eagle wings we soar,
And sin an sense molest no more;
And heav'n comes down our souls to greet,
While glory crowns the mercy seat."
410;From Glory To Glory;;"From glory to glory He's
changing me
Changing me, changing
me
His likeness and image
to perfect in me
The love that God shows
to His bride

For He's changing me,
changing me,
From the earthly things
to the heavenly
His likeness and image
to perfect in me
The love that God shows
to His bride."
411;From Sinking Sand He Lifted Me;;"In loving kindness Jesus came,
My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame,
Through grace He lifted me.

CHORUS
From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand, He lifted me,
From shades of night to plains
of light,
Oh, praise His Name, He lifted me.

He called me long before I heard,
Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His Word,
Forgiven, He lifted me.

His brow was pierced with
many a thorn,
His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief forlorn,
In love He lifted me.

Now on a higher plane I dwell,
And with my soul I know 'tis well,
Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
He should have lifted me."
412;From The Earthly;;"If this earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved
We have another one waiting eternal in the heavens
He said I go to prepare a place for you
That where I am there you may be also

CHORUS
From the earthly to the heavenly
From this body to our theophany
From this old pest house to our Father's house
That's a mansion he's built for you and me
That's a mansion he's built for you and me

In this body we groan desiring to be clothed upon
With our new body celestial in the heavens
So when this corruption shall have put on incorruption
Then mortality shall be swallowed up of life

Soon we'll lay aside this old ragged robe of flesh
In exchange for a glorious one prepared in the heavens
And at the resurrection at the sounding of the trump
Our bodies will be glorified just like Jesus"
413;From The Rising Of The Sun;;"From the rising of the sun
to the time that it goes down
The name of the Lord
shall be praised

From the rising of the sun
to the time that it goes down
The name of the Lord
shall be praised

The Lord is high above
the Nations
His Glory above the heavens
And who is like unto
the Lord our God
Who dwelleth on high

From the rising of the sun
to the time that it goes down
The name of the Lord
shall be praised"

One foot on sea
You brought redemption for me
I was lost and undone
But thank God your grace
Has indeed really found me
And you gave to me
Eye salve that I may see
How great you are
And what you've made me to be

CHORUS
Full redemption
I found grace in a
time of judgment
The stone that the
builders rejected
Has become the
chief stone of my life
For he has gone
to prepare a place
That where he is I'll be there
For all eternity.

I see a world held in darkness
O there is so much evil around me
But Lord with you I am standing
For I know that soon your kingdom
Will be ushered in
Continue to break
Every kingdom in my heart
Till I only be your living
word manifested

BRIDGE
I'm waiting with great expectation
For my Lord,
Who  I'll see
Soon I will slip from time
Into eternity.

Full redemption
Lord I thank you for your
grace that found me
Full restoration you promise
Lord I hold thy word
close to my heart
Soon I will be in that perfect place

Where there's no more time
No sorrow
No more sickness and pain
No more sin and temptation
Only peace, joy and love
For all eternity
For all eternity"

By God
In His image We

We are justified and sanctified and baptised
By the Holy Ghost and power just like Pentecost
But full Word of God now dwelleth in the Bride
God in human flesh, the mighty God unveiled
For God has always had skin on Him

We are feasting on God
The spiritual food in due season
And our flesh is becoming the Word of God
And the Word of God is becoming incarnate,
For God has always had skin on Him

It
As she changes from natural to spiritual,
By God
She reveals the second fold of God
Christ in His Bride having the pre-eminence

Jesus has a table spread before us
Of the seven course menu

Proving His Word,
Choosing a Bride,
Ashamed of Him, Blasphemous names,
Convinced and concerned,
Uniting time and sign

The message of Grace, Oneness with God,
Marriage and Divorce
The kinsman redeemer, It
I have heard but now I see,
He cares do you care, How can I overcome

Shalom shalom We are changing from glory
We are changing from glo..ry to glo..ry!"

Guilty of love in the first degree
So He had to go to Calvary
When He shed His last drop of blood for me
And the jury found Him guilty of love in the first degree.

verse 1
Order in the court
Would you bring the prisoner forward please!
""And what sir is your name""?
And he said, ""Jesus of Nazarathe""
You are accused of healing on the sabbath day
And many other things  the elders did say

Verse 1
They say your desciples plucked corn
On the sabbath day and did eat
And that you yourself sat with sinners at meat
And what have you to say
But he kept silence at day
But wait lets see what the witness had to say

verse 2
My name is Bathemeus and I was blind
And could not see the light of the day
Oh but I can see today because of him
And another come and another

Verse 2
There was another and he said I was a leper
I was one of the ten
And I have come back this finnal time
Just to glorify him

verse 3
And on and on they come that day
Each for him had kind words to say
But then the crowed begun to cry out
Crucify him! Crucify him!
Give us Barabus
This man here he must die

Verse 3
So they took him away
To a place called calvary
And nailed him to the cross
Between two thieves
For the jury had surely
Found him gilty
Gilty of love in the first degree

The most holy one

They brought their own indictment
When once again they slew the lamb
Of the blood of the lamb
Tell me what would you do
With this Jesus called Christ?

Some thro' the waters,
Some thro' the flood,
Some thro' the fire,
But all thro' the blood;
Some thro' great sorrow,
But God gives a song;
In the night season
And all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount
Where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley
In the darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

Tho' sorrows befall us,
And Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer,
Defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.

Away from the mire,
And away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity's day.
God leads His dear children along."

When you're upon the mountain

Of trials and temptation

Is really put to the test.

Bridge 1
Think of the prophet
In that treacherous hour
What could he do;

Bridge 1
Wife and child died
He was down in the valley
Of trials and temptations
That's where his faith
Rose to the heights.

When faced with troubles
In all life situations
And there's no one to help you
All hope is gone;

You are down in the valley
Of trials and temptations
Look up to Jesus
The Perfector of our faith.

And the whole wide world will see.

I was not the first one to come into this place,
You see every child of God this test he must face,
It is here that God will mould you,
And make you what you ought to be.
God will make this trial a blessing,
Just be patient you will see.

I'm standing on the mountain,
Looking back I can see
When I was in my lowest valley,
His strong hand was leading me.

And to taste sweet victory!

Oh, the love He has for me."

Where she can have what she desires,
For the anointing is released to her
To display authority and power.
To have the blind and deaf
The sick and dead raised by the Word,
She's a mighty marching army,
She'll shake the world with her ministry.

God's church is sounding the jubilee
And setting the captive free;
She's conquering the enemy
From victory unto victory;
She is strong and courageous
In the revival of the just,
She's made her final turn at the west,
And she is marching the victor's march

God's church is waving the banner high,
For her victory day is nigh;
She's in position on the Seventh Peak
For the super power now to strike.
She'll be a witness to the total lost
By manifesting the greater works,
And the New Name that she bears with pride,
Once again, it will be glorified.

God's church is singing the victor's song,
As the battle rages on,
All things are under her dominion,
She knows the battle is already won.

For communion in the sky,
And those waiting mighty gentile

Will rise and join in the victor's march."

snow-white Dove,
God sent His pure
sweet love,
On the wings of a

To take His eagle home. x2

I knew somehow I was born to fly
Way up in the sky,
But somehow I couldn't set my wings free;
But since that day I heard His voice
And made Him my heavenly choice,
By His grace I can say I've been set free.

Now behold what manner of love
The Father hath bestowed upon us,
That we might be called the Sons of God!
Wherever He bids us we will go,
Wherever He leads we will follow,
'Cause who the Son has set free is free indeed."

It's the rising of the sun,
When the children of God on the earth are born;
This Evening Light from above,
It's nothing less than God's elective love.

I see Mary, she's walking slowly,
Along the narrow road that's dusty,
When the child is born your sorrow will be gone;
""Esther, Esther, touch that sceptre,
With the King you have found  favour;""
Anything you do, do it in that name.

Samson's locks are now a little longer,
Faith muscles are becoming stronger,
Between the pillars the Lord will strike His Masterpiece;
Now the Headstone is drawing nearer,
Dynamics are worked in greater measure;
Pulsations of faith will soon create: ""Let there be.""

Seven Thunders activating the countdown,
The North Star leads the battle stars to the showdown,
Two hundred million devils
Joel's mighty army comes on display,
The elements will tremble
For strong is the Lord that
Our hearts are burning with expectation,
For the promised eternal vacation,
Reservations have already been made;
Next attraction, coming soon,
Bridegroom and Bride leave for honeymoon,
On the wings of Love she'll take
her flight thru' the
skies."

The way he did with Abraham.

Where we know we were predestinated
before the  foundation of the world to walk by faith.

Verse2
This is the age of Laodicea, where men
and women fight for their rights, for their rights
False doctrine and creeds feel welcome in this world,
For this is the age Satan sits on his throne, on his throne;

Where many are drunken from her wine;
And this is the age where the mysteries go back to the East,

So I'm looking nine times before I make one step,
Don't want to be caught
In an unconscious state of mind,
For I want to leave this earth
In the twinkling of an eye.

I'm going to slip from time into eternity,
I'm going to become one with my Theophany,
Going to live in that mansion
God has prepared for me,
I'm going to leave this pest-house for eternity.

We're going to be reunited with
Who have gone on before to another dimension;
Soon we'll see Him face to face,
The One who lives inside our hearts;
Who saved us by His amazing grace,
We'll be with Him never to depart.

Got any rivers you think are uncrossable?
Got any mountains you cannot tunnel through?
God specializes in things thought impossible,
And He will do what no other power can do.

Battles to win! they would meet with their obstacles
Jericho's walls, too, must fall to the ground.
God never failed; He stood back of His promises,
Walls had to crumble as they marched around.

God is the same and His Word is dependable
He'll make a way through the waters for you;
Life's situations by Him are amendable,
Mountains and hills He will part for you too."
498;Grace Greater Than Our Sin;;"Chorus
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within!
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin!

Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt!

Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold,
Threaten the soul with infinite loss.
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge, the mighty Cross.

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide.
What can avail to wash it away?
Look! There is flowing a crimson tide;
Whiter than snow you may be today.

Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe!
You that are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?"
499;Great And Wonderful;;"Great and Wonderful,
The myst'ries of God revealed,
In simplicity, praise the Lord

Though people say, ""Not for
today"",
Still it's wonderful,
God's prophet we must obey,
Not a shadow of doubt,
Christ appeared in a Cloud,
To the Bride it is wonderful."

Had it not been for a Man called Jesus,

I'm so glad He was willing to drink that bitter cup,
Although He prayed, ""Father let it pass from me,""
I'm so glad He didn't call Heaven's
angels,
To take the nails from His hands that set me free.

I'm so glad He has promised a second cycle,
And I'm so glad He's now riding this trail again,
I'm so glad He revealed those Seven Thunders
To give His Bride the power in His New Name.

Had it not been for those Seven Seals
Had it not been for that Seventh Angel,
Then forever, our souls would be lost."

But  You always declare your righteousness
For when sickness fell in the camp that day
The brazen serpent was lifted
And You showed us back the way

With a Joshua commission and the Holy Ghost on hand
Fear not children for the faith is here
It will manifest the third pull and rapture us away."

Only still to hunger on.

Only mocked my soul's sad cry.

Untold wealth that never faileth,

O happy day, that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Saviour and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my
sins away!
He taught me how to
watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day.

sins away!

O happy bond, that seals my vows
To Him who merits all my love!
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,
While to that sacred shrine
I move.

Charmed to confess the
voice divine."

'Tis thy Saviour, hear His Word;
Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee,
""Say poor sinner, lov'st thou Me?""

""I deliv'red thee when bound,
And, when bleeding,
healed thy wound;
Sought thee wand'ring,
set thee right
Turned thy darkness into light

""Can a woman's tender care
Cease towards the child
she bare?
Yes, she may forgetful be,
Yet will I remember thee

""Mine is an unchanging Love
Higher than the heights above,
Deeper that the depths beneath
Free and faithful, strong as death

Though shalt see My Glory soon
When the work of grace is done;
Partner of My Throne shalt be:
Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou Me?""

Lord it is my chief complaint
That my love is weak and faint
Yet I love Thee and adore
O for grace to love Thee more!"

Who died upon the cruel tree?
To think of His great sacrifice at Calvary,
I know my Lord expects the best from me.

CHORUS
How many are the lost that I have lifted?
How many are the chained I've helped to free?
I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus,
When He has done so much for me?

The hours that I have wasted are so many,
The hours I've spent for Christ so few.
Because of all my lack of love for Jesus,
I wonder if His heart is
breaking too?

I wonder, have I cared enough for others,
Or have I let them die alone?
I might have helped a wanderer to the Saviour;
The seed of precious Life I might have sown.

No longer will I stay within the valley,
I'll climb to mountain heights above;
The world is dying now for want of someone
To tell them of the Saviour's matchless love."

Humbly I bow.

Help me, I pray!

And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter
abides with me.

I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter
abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus
died upon the tree;

Verse 2
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

Verse 3
He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care

and just as free;

Verse 3
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter
abides with me!

Verse 4
There's no thirsting for the things
Of the world,
they've taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up,
and instantly;

Verse 4
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter
abides with me!"

To worship and adore
The Lamb of God, victorious

death, hell and the grave

'Neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins
Dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord
From the deep, miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out
to golden day.

CHORUS
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah.

He placed me upon
The strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established
and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling
While here I remain,
But stand by His grace
Until the crown I gain.

He gave me a song,
'Twas a new song of praise,
By day and by night
Its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing,
I'm happy and free,
I'll praise my Redeemer,
Who has rescued me.

I'll sing of His wonderful
mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men
His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation
At home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth
And trust in God.

I'll tell of the pit,
With its gloom and despair,
I'll praise the dear Father,
Who answered my prayer;
I'll sing my new song,
The glad story of love,
Then join in the chorus
With the saints above."

That almost covered  me."

When we shall see Him, the King in His beauty,
Our Bridegroom, Redeemer, and Friend.

Chorus
Jesus is coming,
Our Saviour and Lover divine;
Soon in His glory
The ransomed of ages will shine;
Ages on ages we'll reign
With our King on His throne;
Wonderful story! We'll share in His glory,
Redeemed by His mercy alone.

Lift up your heads and rejoice,
Oh ye righteous,
Your perfect redemption is nigh;
Swiftly the darkness of midnight approaches,
""He cometh,"" shall sound from the sky.
Long has the battle been waged against evil
By suffering saints here below.
Jesus is coming to banish our sorrow,
And lead us where tears never flow.

Come, dear Lord Jesus.
Thy promise fulfilling;
""Come quickly!"" our souls cry to Thee:
Long has the world been enthralled
by the tempter,
The curse is on land and on sea.
Yet Thou shalt triumph, the nations subduing,
The truth of the Word cannot fail;
God's wondrous glory, like ocean's deep billows,
To earth's farthest bounds shall prevail."

I saw the blood come trickling down
From the thorn pierced crown
I saw mockers
As they mocked His Holy name
Isaw the spear that pierced His side
As ""forgive them"" He cried
As the blood and water from
His body came
I saw the look upon face
Oh the pain and disgrace
As the heart of my Saviour
Broke with grief
I saw stripes He bore for me
As He worked on Calvary
And I know He did all for ME

CHORUS
He could called an angel then
To unbind His feet and hands
Restore the wounds and let Him go free
But the pain and disgrace
Should have been mine
But He took my place
And I know He did it all for ME

verse 2
I saw the dark and empty tomb
I saw Mary filled with gloom
She thought that they
Had taken her Lord away
And though He had to go away
He will return again some day
To take us home eternaly
Now salvation is complete
Death has settled great defeat
And I know He did it all for ME"

That He left us
Thats a long long time ago
They are not getting older

Because he still wants us to know

Chorus
He didn't bring us this far
To leave us
He didn't teach us his will
To let us strife
He didn't build his hope in us
To move away
He didn't lift us up
To let us down

Claim his promises
Every one of them
And every spoken word he'll keep
Because we're everything to him"

I can say the Lord has been so good to me, yeah.
Don't you know He woke me up this morning and started me on my way,

He didn't have to save me, thank God He did,
He didn't have to save me but He did, yeah.
He woke me up this morning and started me on my way,
He didn't have to save me but He did.

He didn't have to wake me, but He did,
He didn't have to wake me I'm glad He did

570;He Didnt Throw The Clay Away;;"Empty and broken, I came back to Him
A vessel unworthy, so scarred with sin.
But He did not despair...He started over again
And I bless the day, He didn't throw the clay away.

Over and over, He molds me and makes me,
Into His likeness, He fashions the clay.
A vessel of honor, I am today,
All because Jesus didn't throw the clay away.

He is the Potter...I am the clay
And molded in His image, He wants me to stay.
Oh, but when I stumble...
When I fall...
When my vessel breaks,
He just picks up those pieces,
He does not throw the clay away...

Over and over, He molds me and makes me,
Into His likeness, He fashions the clay.
A vessel of honor, I am today,
All because Jesus didn't throw the clay away.

All because Jesus didn't throw the clay away."

His power has no boundary
known unto man,
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,
He giveth and giveth and giveth more grace.

And the day is done.
When we've reached the end of our hoarded resources,
Our Father's full giving has only begun."

He hideth my life
In the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away,
He holdeth me up,
And I shall not be moved,

Each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,

Jesus is far more to me
Than in all my glowing day dreams
I had fancied He could be;
And the more I get to know Him,
So the more I find Him True,
And the more I long that others
Should be led to know Him too.

He is not a disappointment !
He has saved my soul from sin:
All the guilt and all the anguish,
Which oppressed my heart within,
He has banished by His presence,
And His blessed kiss of peace
Has assured my heart forever
That his love will never cease.

He is not a  disappointment !
He has healed my body too:
What a tender, mighty Saviour,
There is naught He cannot do !
When on earth He healed diseases
As they touched Him in the throng;
Has he lost His heart of pity ?
Is the risen Christ less strong ?

He is not a  disappointment !
He is coming by and by,
In my heart I have the witness
That His coming draweth nigh.
All the scoffers may despise me,
But He tells me He is coming,
And no change around may see,
And that's quite enough for me.

He is not a disappointment!
He is all in all to me-
Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer;
The unchanging Christ is He!
He has won my heart's affections,
And He meets my every need;
He is not a disappointment,
For He satisfies indeed."

On this Morning, Let

594;He Keeps Me Singing;;"Chorus
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
Sweetest name I know,
Fills my ev'ry longing,
Keeps me singing as I go.

There's within my heart a melody.
Jesus whispers sweet and low:
""Fear not, I am with thee; peace, be still,""
In all of life's ebb and flow.

All my life was wrecked by sin and strife;
Discord filled my life with pain.
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
Stirred the slumb'ring chords again.

Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting 'neath His shelt'ring wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing.

Tho' sometimes He leads thro' waters deep,
Trials fall across my way,
Tho' sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
See His footprints all the way.

Soon He's coming back to welcome me
Far beyond the starry sky.
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown;
I shall reign with Him on high."

This wonderful friend of mine.

This wonderful friend of mine."
596;He Knew Me;;"Verse 1
I'm not on an eagle tree
I'm nothing on my own
I make mistakes and often slip
Just common flesh and bones;

Verse 1
But He will prove some day
Just what I see
I am of a special kind
When He was on the cross
I was on His mind

Chorus
He knew me yet He loved me
He whose glory makes the heaven shine
So unworthy, of such mercy
When He was on the cross, I was on His mind.

Verse 2
The look of love was on His face
The thorns upon His head
The blood ran down
His scarlet robe
It stained with crimson red;

Verse 2
Though His eyes were on the cross that day
Jesus looked ahead in time
For when He was on the cross
You and I were on His mind."
597;He Knows My Name;;"I have a Father
He calls me His own
He never leaves me,
No matter what the cause

Chorus
He knows my name,
He knows
my every thought,
He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call.

I have a Maker,
He formed my heart,
Before even time began,
My Life was in His hands.

Where'er I be,

That leadeth me.

CHORUS
He leadeth me,
He leadeth me,
By His own hand He leadeth me:
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.

Sometimes 'mid scenes
Of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden's
bowers bloom,
By waters still,
O'er troubled sea,
Still 'tis His hand
That leadeth me!

Lord, I would clasp
Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since 'tis my God
That leadeth me!

And when my task
On earth is done,
When, by Thy grace,
The victry's won,
E'en death's cold wave
I will not flee,
Since God thro' Jordan
leadeth me."
599;He Leads Me;;"He leads me beside still waters
He restores my soul
The Lord He is my shepherd
Now I have everything I need
He makes me rest beneath the stream
And He leads me beside the quiet stream

Chorus
You rod and your staff
They comfort me
In the presence of my enemies

Even when I walk
Through the valley of death
I will not be afraid
For you'll fill my cup
till overflowing
And you anoint my head with oil
Your goodness and mercy
shall be with me all my life
and you'll help me to do
what honours you the most
And I will live  in your house my Lord
forever and ever"

Christ Jesus lives today,

He lives within my heart."
602;He Looked Beyond My Faults;;"Amazing grace shall always be
My song of praise,
For it was grace
That bought my liberty.
I do not know
Just why He came to love me so
He looked beyond my faults,
And saw my need.

Chorus
I shall forever lift mine eyes,
To Calvary,
To view the Cross,
Where Jesus died for me.
How marvelous the grace,
That caught my falling soul,
He looked beyond my faults,
And saw my need.

It was God's grace
that brought me out of darkness,
And to the light
where I can clearly see,
I'll shout it from the mountains
and the valleys;
He looked beyond my faults
and saw my need."
603;He Made A Road Through The Wilderness;;"verse 1
With the Red Sea behind them,
The desert before them,
The children of God had to trust in the Lamb,
As they followed and waited.
Each day He created a way
That was leading to the Promised Land.

chorus
He made a road
through the wilderness,
As only God could do.
He made a road
through the wilderness,
But the power of love flowed through

verse 2
A fallen creation,
We were in need of salvation,
With no open road to the love we had lost.
But the Father who made us,
He reached down and forgave us.
And He opened up our road to the rugged Cross.

"
604;He Made The Stars To Shine;;"He made the stars to shine,

Became the crucified."
605;He Makes A Trail Over The Mountain;;"He makes a trail over the mountain,
He makes a path through the sea.
He makes a road over the river,

He makes the storm go away!
Oh, they call His Name Jesus -
He has surely made a way!"
606;He Paid A Debt;;"He paid a debt He did not owe,
I owed a debt I could not pay,
I needed someone
to wash my sins away;
And now I sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay.

He paid a debt at Calvary,
He cleansed my soul
and set me free,
I'm glad that Jesus did
all my sins erase.
I now can sing a brand new song,
Amazing grace all day long,
Christ Jesus paid a debt
That I could never pay.

One day He's coming back for me,
To live with Him eternally,
Won't it be glory
to see Him on that day!

I have the right to know every reason why
But he gave the assurance to be with me through it all.

Chorus
He promised me Grace x3
To pass thru every trial,
He promised me Grace x3
Until the storm passes away.

Verse 2
Before I dropped into time
He never showed me what il have to meet
Otherwise he knew I would refuse to walk therein
Before I could even start this journey of my life
But he kept it a mystery
That will unfold each time I take one step
So that I wholly depend on him
And let me know he can carry me through.

Verse 3
All the smiles and all my blissful days,
Or the tears pain and sorrows
Beautiful joys of the morning;
Or the long dark nights of my life
He has seen they're worth it all.
To make my testimony more glorious
AS I REACH TO THE DESTINY OF IMMORTALITY."

A sea before them lay;
The Lord reach'd down
His mighty hand,
And rolled the sea away.

Chorus
Then forward still,
'tis Jehovah's will,
Tho' the billows dash and spray,
With a conq'ring tread
we will push ahead
He'll roll the sea away.

Before me was a sea of sin,
So great I feared to pray;
My heart's desire the Savior read,
And rolled the sea away.

When sorrows dark, like stormy waves,
Were dashing o'er my way,
Again the Lord in mercy came,
And rolled the sea away.

And when I reach the sea of death,
For needed grace I'll pray;
I know the Lord will quickly come,
And roll the sea away."
610;He Said Come;;"Verse 1

and the backslider too

And stand by my side
And drink from the fountain
You won't be denied
I have seen every tear drop
that fell from your eyes
And I rose to tell you for your tears I die.

verse 2
He is calling for the sick
And calling for the lame
If you don't be healed
He's not to blame
He died on the cross but now He's alive
And He rose to tell you
For your tears I died.

verse 3
He's calling for the motherless
And the fatherless
With no brother nor sister
To care for you
He died on the cross
But now He's alive
And He rose to tell you
For your tears He died."
611;He Set Me Free;;"Once like a bird
In prison I dwelt.
No freedom from
My sorrow I felt.
Then Jesus came
And listened to me,
Glory to God,
He set me free.

CHORUS
He set me free,
Yes, He set me free.
He broke the bonds
Of prison for me.
I'm glory bound
My Jesus to see,
Glory to God,
He set me free.

Now I am climbing
Higher each day,
Darkness of night
Has drifted away.
My feet are planted
On higher ground,
Glory to God,
I'm homeward bound.

Good-bye to sin
And things that confound,
Naught of this world
Shall turn me around,
Daily I'm working,
I'm praying too,
Glory to God,
I'm going through."
612;He Showed Me A Pure Water;;"And He showed me a pure river

He took my sins away,
He took my sins away,
And keeps me singing every day!
I'm so glad He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.

The load of sin
Was more than I could bear,
He took them all away,
He took them all away.
And now on Him
I roll my every care,
He took my sins away.

No condemnation
Have I in my heart,
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.
His perfect peace
He did to me impart,
He took my sins away.

If you will come
To Jesus Christ today,
He'll take your sins away,
He'll take your sins away.
And keep you happy
In His love each day,
He'll take your sins away."

That floods my soul!

And now I know,

And made me whole,

I'll shout it while eternity rolls."

Who would die on the cross for me!
Freely shedding His precious life blood,
That the sinner might be made free.

CHORUS
He was nailed to the cross for me,
He was nailed to the cross for me;
On the cross crucified, for me He died;
He was nailed to the cross for me.

Thus He left His heavenly glory
To accomplish His Father's plan;
He was born of the Virgin Mary,
Took upon Him the form of man.

He was wounded  for our transgressions,
And He carried our sorrows, too;
He's the Healer of every sickness,
This He came to the world to do.

So He gave His life for others
In redeeming this world from sin,
And He's gone to prepare a mansion,
That at last we may enter in."
619;He Was There All The Time;;"Verse 1
Time after time
I was searching
For peace in some void,
I was trying to blame
All my ills on this world;

Verse 1
I was in surface relationships
Used me till
I was done in,
But all this time
Someone was waiting
To free me from my sin.

Chorus
He was there all the time,
He was there all the time
Waiting patiently in line,
He was there all the time.

Never again will I look
For a rainbow's end,
Now that I have the answer
For my life;

Patiently waiting in line.

621;He Was Wounded For Transgressions;;"Verse 1
On the cross crucified,
In great sorrow He died;
The giver of life was He,
Yet my Lord was despised
And rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary.

Chorus
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities,
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Verse 2
Price for healing was paid,
As those cruel stripes were made,
With-in Pilate
Now His suffering afford perfect healing for all,
This wonderful Healer's mine.

Came the leper to Christ,
Saying ""surely I know, that thou,
Lord canst make me whole"",
When his great faith was seen
Jesus said, ""Yes I will"",

Made me every whit whole,
And he'll do the same for you,
He
This Healer of men to-day."
622;He Wasn't Looking At Me;;"He wasn't looking at me,

Flowing rich and free,
That precious blood, that covers me."
623;He Will Understand It;;"If when you give the best of your service:
Telling the world that the Saviour is coming:
Be not dismayed, though man don't believe you,
He will understand say well done x2

Chorus
O when I come, to the end of my journey
Weary of life, and the battle is won
Carrying the staff and the cross of redemption
He will understand say well done x2

But if you try , and fail in your trying
Hands sored and scared, from the work you have done
Take up your cross, run quickly to meet Him
He will understand say well done x2

Misunderstood was the Saviour of sinners
Hung on the cross, He was God's only Son
Calling above to His Father in Heaven
Let not my will but thine be done x2

If when this life, of labour is ended
And the reward of the race you'll have run
On the sweet rest, prepare for the faithful
Will be His best and final well done. x2"
624;He' My Lord;;"I realized that I'm one of the few
Chosen to run in this race
And I found out that it's not what I do
But it was only by grace

CHORUS
He's my Lord, He's my treasure
He's one of a kind
By His own He was rejected
Now Jesus is mine
And I won't trade Him for diamonds
Neither silver nor gold
Because Jesus is the treasure in my soul
Jesus is the treasure in my soul

He brought me out from a dark world of sin
I was so lost and so blind
He told me that I am now part of Him
Sharing in His love divine

I am so thankful for His precious grace
My heart will always rejoice
His tender mercy I now can embrace
I'm glad He made me His choice

Not for all the precious diamonds
Not for silver or gold
Not for all the pretty jewels
Neither rubies nor pearls
Not for fame and not for fortune
Nor the riches of this world
Because Jesus is the treasure in my soul
Jesus is the treasure in my soul (2x)"

You may be down and feel like God
Has somehow forgotten,
That you are faced
Circumstances you can't get through;

Verse 1
Right now it seems there is no way out
And you're going under,
But, God has proven time and time again
He'll take care of you.

Chorus
And He'll do it again
He'll do it again
If you just take a look
At where you are now,
And where you have been,

For you,
He's the same now as then
You may not know how,
You may not know when,
But he'll do it again.

Verse 2
My God knows the pain
You're going through and he knows
How you're hurting,
You see, he knows just how your
Heart has been broken in two,

Verse 2
But He is the God of the stars and of
The sun and of the sea,
And he is your father.
He can calm the storm and find a way
To take care of you.

And that furnished all the galaxies,
And that same hand that holds the world in space,
Is the same hand that's holding me.

CHORUS
And He'll never let go of my hand
Till I stand in heaven's fair land,
Till I'm safe forever more,
On that happy golden shore,
No, He'll never let go of my hand.

And He's been true when storms have  assailed;
But His holy love that amazes me
Is that He loves me, even when I fail."

The many times I could not pray,
Still my God, He was faithful to me;
The days I've spent so selfishly

Every time I come back to Him,
He is waiting with open arms,
And I see once again."

Even now we feel His presence coming down.

Neither shall His covenant of His peace be removed

Or painted on the starlit sky,
God's faithful
witnesses declare,
That the coming of the Saviour
Draweth nigh.

The dead in Christ who 'neath us lie,
In countless numbers all shall rise,
When through the portals of the sky,
He shall come to prepare our Paradise.

Caught up, shall meet our faithful Lord.
This hope we cherish not in vain,
But we comfort one another
By this Word."

It took Him just a week to make the Moon and the Stars,
The Sun and the Earth, Jupiter and Mars;
How loving and patient He must be,
He's still working on me.

The mirror of His Word, reflections that I see
Make me wonder why He never gave up on me,
But He loves me as I am
And He helps me when I pray,
Remember He's the Potter I'm just clay.

Well it can't be much longer,
Soon that ship will be here."

After I wandered in darkness away,
Jesus my Saviour I met
O what a tender compassionate friend

Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling

When at the Cross the Saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away and my night was turned to day
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul

Born of the spirit with life from above
Into God
Justified fully through Calvary

And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came
Took of the offer of grace He did offer
He save me O praise His dear name

They faced temptations, yet they stood true
But I'm living in the most evil of all ages that ever was

When on the earth you were confronted
By the tempter you did not bow
You overcame all temptations, yes, every one
You defied him, Your precious Blood flowed
To cleanse and give me strength to stand
So now I pray Lord, by that same Blood
I'll overcome"

Tho' the billows of sin near me roll,
He abides, Christ abides.

Beneath the toil and care of life,
This hidden stream flows on;
My weary soul no longer thirsts,
Nor am I sad and lone.

I cannot tell the half of love,
Unfeigned, supreme, divine,
That caused my darkest in-most self
With beams of hope to shine.

To suffer and to die,
But if I suffer here with Him
I'll reign with Him on high."

Than to look at me and see Yourself.

Chorus
So hide me away Lord
In Your bosom I want to be
Into your secret place
It's my deepest desire Lord,
It's all of You Lord
I'm crying out prayerfully
Seeking Your Holy face
For all that You promised me.

Lord I had many victories before
But now I see this world is shaking

Take all that is not of Thee

In sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation
Casts o'er me its power;
In the tempests of life,
On its wide heaving sea,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I'm hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict,
When pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and
Breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials
Like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee,
Oh Thou Rock of my soul."

By faith on Heaven's table land,
A higher plane
than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell
Where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray
till heaven I've found,
Lord, lead me on
to higher ground.

That he would die, God's son would die
To save a wretch like me

In the beautiful garden of Eden;
When God made man and placed him
Over the earth to have dominion,
But He saw man was alone,
He had no one to share his home.

So God put man into a sleep
And took from his side,
One of his ribs close to his heart
With which He formed his bride.
His missing rib has been restored,
His missing rib was in bride form.

A home for the Presence of the Lord
So let my life now be separated unto Thee

In a tumble nothing was ever the same
Man was put out of the Presence of God
Created man became a fallen man
The First tabernacle God made Himself to dwell

Groan and travaileth in pain together until now
How much more they who the first fruits
Of the Spirit groan awaiting adoption
Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you
He has returned we
The sign of our redemption

The saints and sages all long for this moment
These are things angel desire to look into
The grace that I have seen by the revelation
That
I have come to know
I have the Spirit of a heavenly country
That
I
From a heavenly kingdom

Lord forgive me for the many times I turned you away
I was born to be a dwelling place for Thee

For this is the hour of great Temptation
Hold fast which thou has let no man take thy crown"

When He speaks all my darkness turns light"
676;His Way;;"Verse 1
God moves in a mysterious way
His glorious wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea
And rides upon the storm.

Verse 2
Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never failing skill
He treasures up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign will.

Verse 3
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take.
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break,
In blessings on your head.

Verse 4
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace;
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.

Verse 5
His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour:
The bud may have a bitter taste
But sweet will be the flower.

Verse 6
Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan His work in vain:
God is His own interpreter,
And He will make it plain."

His power can make you
What you ought to be.
His blood can cleanse your heart
And make you free.
His love can fill your soul
And you will see
'Twas best for Him to have
His way with thee.

Verse 1
Would you live for Jesus,
And be always pure and good?
Would you walk with Him
Within the narrow road?
Would you have Him bear your burden,
Carry all your load?
Let Him have His way with thee.

Verse 2
Would you have Him make you free,
And follow at His call?
Would you know the peace
That comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you,
So that you need never fall?
Let Him have His way with thee.

Verse 3
Would you in His kingdom
Find a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true
In providential test?
Would you in His service labor
Always at your best?
Let Him have His way with thee."

I'll shout ""Glory, Glory!!""
When I rise to meet Him yonder
For His Word is Truth"

His service is my sweetest delight,
His blessings ever flow.

Verse 1
I've found my Lord and He is mine,
He won me by His love,
I'll serve Him all my years of time,
And dwell with Him above.

Verse 2
No other Lord but Christ I know,
I walk with Him alone,
His streams of love forever flow,
Within my heart His throne.

Verse 3
He's dearer to my heart than life,
He found me lost in sin,
He calmed the sea of inward strife,
And bid me come to Him.

Verse 4
My flesh recoiled before the cross,
And Satan whispers there,
Thy gain will not repay the loss,
His yoke is hard to bear.

Verse 5
I've tried the road of sin and found,
Its prospects all deceive,
I've proved the Lord and joys abound,
More than I could believe."

But remember,if God is with us
He's more,than the whole world aganist us

chorus
(So we've got to hold on)
Hold on, a little longer
Hold on, a little longer
(One of these days)
Everything is going to be all right

verse 2
There was a place called Egypt's land
It was under Pharaoh's command
And he held my God's people
In bondage there
(Oh yes he did church)
When they were praying
They had to steal away
These are the wordsthat
God's people would say

verse 3
It was in my God's plan
To send Moses down in Egypt's land
He said,"" Moses,go tell old Pharaoh
You better let my people go""
And when moses was drawing nigh
I know he heard his sisters
And brothers cry
But he told them to hold on

verse 4
Moses led the children out of bondage
Down to the banks of the Red sea
Some of them were troubled in mind
""Cause Pharaoh's army was close behind,
God is on our side
And He will do what He said
All you've got to do is hold on

verse 5
There was a rod in Moses' hand
He stretched it out
And they walked across on the land
And when they had reached
The other side
And Moses had saw
Everybody was all right
He turned and looked around
Streached forth his rod again
And Pharaoh's army was drawned
He said all you've got to do is hold on

verse 6
When Moses mission
Had come to an end
God took him on the mountain and
He showed him the promise land
Then Moses told Joshua what to do
He said"" You are the one,
to lead the children through""
He said I've been on the mountain,
I've looked at the promise land
There is one thing you've got to understand
All you've got to do is hold on

Hold on, saints, hold on,
Keep on walking in the footsteps of the Lord;
Hold on, saints, be strong,
Walk in confidence and faith,
God will take us to that city where we belong.

Though the world is against us we could never be deceived,
If we are walking in the footsteps of the Lord;
And like Joshua and Caleb keep on claiming your mountain,
And never compromise the word of God;
And although your bodies might get weaker every day,
Never let your testimonies
ever be taken away.
Just hold on

We know just what the devil's gonna do before he realizes,
God uncovers his every scheme to show us his ways;
How he tries to enter our minds to deceive us with lust and lies
But we are justified and we are sanctified,
And there'll be no compromise;
God is saying to His bride, ""Speak the word!""
So keep on your armour, you're heading towards the third pull.
Just hold on

The world will try to crucify the word that is growing in us,
Those who are walking in the footsteps of the Lord;
But those who place values on the word could never be shaken,
And would never compromise the word of God;
We have seen so many fall from the word,
So let's keep our eyes on the prize and turn away from the world.

Onward comes our great Commander.

And at that time thy people shall be delivered,
Everyone that shall be found written in the book

Until we all stand with the Lamb in Mt. Zion
The Name written on His thigh, has been written in our foreheads
And we know who our Father is; we came from the loins of Elohim

Verse1
In the time Jeremiah, when the
book of lost truths was found
Israel knew that judgement was at hand,
There was great famine, as the head of gold besieged the land
For the rejection of the Son of Man

Verse1
But the man with the writer
Went to and fro in the land
Setting a mark in the foreheads of those who sighed and cried
And Ezekiel the prophetic priest and the elected of that day;
Was seal away before the wrath of God could hit that place

Verse2
Oh Jerusalem, how oft had I gathered you
As a hen would gather her brood,
Oh if only, you had known the day of your visitation
The things that belongeth to your peace,

Verse2
When you see Jerusalem compassed about with armies
Let not your flight be in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day
But the elect were so united with God in His Word
None of the Christians, not one of the Christians was caught in there

Verse3
In the days of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound
All the written and hidden mysteries would be made known
He said the squeeze is coming; there
As Mystery Babylon takes the world under her control
When the seventh seal was unveiled,

Some Easter flowers were hid away under the second fold
We see famine, war and depression

For the holy new Jerusalem;

Holding my palm in my hand, }2x
Where the eagles are gathered
Worshipping the Lamb,
Holding my palm in my hand.

I'm not boasting about much
I'm not boasting about much inspiration;
But when I look in
And miss Elijah from the scene;
I believe and fear, for I know who is here;
About two hundred pounds
Of  olive skinned complexion,
Pouring out His fullness unto man;
Like John, I shout, Hallelujah!
Holding my palm in my hand.

And when I hear God's Holy Word revealing,
All the mysteries of Christ the Son of Man;
I recognize my day and what the Spirit says,
""Come out of Laodicea;""
For the white horse rider will take the hindmost,
So come into the Royal Holy Ghost;
And the Spirit and the Bride say, ""Come, come, come,""
Holding my palm in my hand.

And when I feel that hot Shekinah
glory,
Drawing me deeper into love's veil;
And I feel those flames of light
Changing my robes to white,
To a place where I could never fail;
For it was by predestination,
He came to dwell in me, His chosen one;
Then let the winds, and the waves, and Satan storm,
I am holding my palm in my hand."

Send the rain from heaven,
Flood our thirsty souls.
We need the Holy Ghost revival,
Revive us Lord,
Open up the heavens, take control.

Now the skies seem brass above us
As we look for the promised rain.
God's servants sow the seed of precious truth,
Just to reap a golden grain;
But the Spirit's power is what we need
To see the harvest come,
So, Lord send the Holy Spirit;
Come and glorify Your Son."

713;How Deep The Fathers Love For Us Lafontaine;;"How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

Behold the man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom"

I am addicted
To the word of the Lord
A desire to feel the heart of God
And to know his mind now dwelleth in me
To see his house complete
I am addicted    (2x)

Now I understand there must be a travailing
A groaning in the inside
When we see the hideous happenings
That has swept upon the face of the whole earth
Men has lost the sanity of their minds
But we are a house of prayer
A river that's flowing out
For we are the ones who would get God's elect out

I am addicted
To prayer to travail
To cry out
To God to be worthy to escape
The wrath of the Lord that is now upon this world
I am addicted

I've heard of the seven thunders
And the seals that were broke open
But I've never understood the depts. About redemption
But now I know the mediator between heaven and earth
Who took the book and broke those seven seals and reveal my
Showing me how to be born again
Now filled with the Holy Ghost
He'll finish the work in me

I am addicted to the word that gives me life
That will rapture my soul and take me away into another place
From the judgement of this world
I am addicted to Hannah's painful desire, Jonah's prayer meeting,
I am addicted to the sweet savour, the holy royal priesthood, the
throne of mercy and judgement and the immune church of Christ"

And it was after she judged Him faithful
He proved that His word could never fail

A body change I will receive
I'm casting out fear
I'm casting out doubt
With God in control
There's nothing to worry about
I believe, yes I believe
His promise to me

Satan you're a liar
And you can't condemn me
You see I understand
It's not what I could do
But it's what Jesus did for me
And with my God all things are possible
And He cannot tell a lie
So I'm casting down my reasoning
I'm the sinless, spotless bride of Christ

Genesis chapter 21, verse 1
And the Lord visited Sarah as He had said
And the Lord did unto Sarah as He had spoken

From faith unto faith
I rise each day
And very soon
I know I'll be raptured away

Yes I believe
His promise to me"
755;I Believe God;;"I believe God!
I believe God!
It shall be done; even as He said

Just trust and obey,
Believe Him and say:
I believe, I believe God."
756;I Believe In A Hill Called Mount Calvary;;"I believe in a hill called mount Calvary
I believe whatever the cost
And when time has surrenderedand earth is no more
l'll still cling to the old rugged cross

l believe that this life with its great mystery
Surely some day will come to an end
oh but faith will conquer the darkness and death
and will lead me at last to my friend

l believe that the Christ me completely
Who was nailed on the cross
Has the power to change lives
Today for he changed
A new life is mine
That is why by the cross l will stay"
757;I Believe Jesus Saves;;"I am coming to Jesus for rest,
Rest, such as the purified know;
My soul is athirst to be blest,
To be washed and made
whiter than snow.

CHORUS

And His blood washes
whiter than snow;
I believe Jesus saves,
And His blood washes
whiter than snow.

In coming, my sin I deplore,
My weakness and poverty show;
I long to be saved evermore,
To be washed and made
whiter than snow.

To Jesus I give up my all,
Every treasure and idol I know;
For His fullness of blessing I call,
Till His blood washes
whiter than snow"
758;I Bless Your Name;;"Verse 1
In prisoners' chains
With bleeding stripes
Paul and Silas prayed that night
And in their pain began to sing
Their chains were loosed
And they were free

I bless Your Name
I give You honour, give You praise
You are the Life, the Truth, the Way
I bless Your Name

Sing out and praise
Defy those chains
And they will fall

759;I Bowed On My Knees;;"I dreamed I went to that city called Glory
So bright and so fair
When I entered the gate I cried ""Holy""
The angels all met me there
They showed me from mansion to mansion
And oh the sights I saw
But I said I want to see Jesus
The One who died for all

Chorus
I bowed on my knees
and cried ""Holy, Holy, Holy"";
I clapped my hands and sang ""Glory,
Glory to the Son of God!""

I thought when I entered that City
My friends knew me well
They showed me all through heaven
The scenes are too numerous to tell
they showed me Abraham, Isaac, Jacob
Mark, Luke and Timothy
But I said I want to give praise
To the One who died for me

I thought when I saw my Saviour
Oh! Glory to God!
I just fell right down before Him
Singing ""Praise to the name of the Lord""
I bowed down and worshiped Jehovah
My friend of Calvary
For I wanted to give praise to Jesus
For saving, a sinner like me."
760;I Came From God;;"verse1
I came from God, I go back to God

Oh thank you Jesus
You saved my life from death

CHORUS 1

Oh hallelujah you filled my life with joy

Chorus 1
Before there was an atom on this earth
Before the stars and sun were made on high
Oh hallelujah; You wrote me in your Book

verse 1
I
It
Before the world was ever made
Oh thank you Jesus
You saved me by your grace

He guides me all the time
And I cannot be deceived
Cause He wrote my name in His book
Before the world was ever made
Oh thank you Jesus He loves me this I know."
761;I Came To Say Thanks;;"Lord, I didn't come here
To ask You for anything,
Lord, I just want to say,
""Thank You Lord.""
You answered a million prayers,
oh God
That I forgot to thank You for,
Lord, I just want to say,
""Thank You Lord.""

CHORUS
For maybe tomorrow
I'll have troubles and sorrows,
And a thousand tears may fall,
But until I face tomorrow's test
I'll have no special favours to ask
Lord, I just want to  say,
""Thank You Lord.""

You've been so good,
And You've been so kind,
I'm so grateful Lord,
I'm so grateful Father,
You kept us in our right minds.
Many times we didn't know what to do,
But You always brought us through,
We come today Lord,
We come today Father,
Just to say, ""Thank You Lord.""

You gave us eyes to see,
When we were bound, You set us free,
We can't forget Lord,
All of the things that You have done.
Lord, we travelled by land
And we travelled by air,
I know You kept us Lord,
You kept us from harm, hurt and danger."
762;I Can Do All Things;;"When I look at myself in the mirror of the word
I see so much to be fulfill
And I know I'll bring to pass that glorious mystery
If only I walk in his will
And I know the way to certain victory
Is to die the death to all that's inside me
So it's not I that live but Christ who lives in me.

CHORUS
I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me
I can be all that God wants me to be
I'll fulfill the greater works
I will bring his word to pass
I'll become that living reality
I can do all things through Christ that strengthen me.

There's a challenge of this age, but the promise to the bride
Is the stature of a perfect man
And I know the way to reach that seven step
Is only through self sacrifice
With the word of God deep inside me
And the Holy Ghost to lead and guide me
With my eyes fix on the cross
I count it all things loss
It's not my will but thine
And in his perfect strength I'll find."
763;I Can Never Repay;;"All the treasures on earth
Could never repay
What Jesus has done for me
That's the way God the father
Had planned it to be
When he sent his only Son
to rescue me
And I could never repay
All I can just say, ""Lord I Love You""

Chorus
I love you Lord
Although I'm not worthy
I'm not worthy of the price
You paid for me
And I could never repay
All I can just say
""Lord I Love You""

Why He loved me so
I really dont know
But I know He careth, for me
Oh and I had never known
The Love that He had shown
When He hung upon the cross
For worthless me
And I could never repay
All I can just say, ""Lord I Love You"""
764;I Can Never Tell;;"I can never tell how much I love Him,
I can never tell His love for me;
For it passeth human measure,
Like a deep unfathomed sea,
'Tis redeeming love in Christ my Saviour,
In my soul the heavenly joys begin;
And I live for Jesus only since the fullness
of His love shone in."
765;I Can Run Through A Troop;;"I can run through a troop,
And leap over a wall,
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
He's my sword and my shield,
He gives power to all,
Hallelujah, hallelujah;

Now I'm free from condemnation,
Jesus is the rock of my salvation,
I can run through a troop,
And leap over a wall,
Hallelujah, hallelujah."
766;I Can't Even Walk;;"I thought that number one
Will surely be me
I thought I would be what I wanted to be
I thought I could build
On life sinking sand
But I can't even walk,
Without holding my hand.

Chorus
I can't even walk
Without You holding my hand
The mountain is too high
The valley is too wide
Down on my knees I've learnt to stay
I can't even walk
Without You holding my hand

I thought that I could do a lot on my own
I thought I could make it on my own
I thought of myself as a mighty big thing
That I can't even walk without
You holding my hand.

Since I met Jesus, my All in All
From now on when I'm in trouble
On His name I'll call
And if I don't trust Him
I'll be less than a man
Because I can't even walk
Without You holding my hand."
767;I Can't Give Up Now;;"There will be mountains
That I would have to climb;
And there will be battles
That I would have to fight;
But victory or defeat,
It's up to me to decide;
But how can I expect to win
If I never tried.

Chorus
I just can't give up now,
I've come too far
From where I started from;
Nobody told me,
The road will be easy;
And I don't believe
He brought me this far
To leave me.

Never said there wouldn't
Be trials;
Never said I wouldn't fall,
Never said that everything
will go the way the way
I want to go;
But when my back is against
The world and feel all hope is gone,
I'll just lift my hands up to the sky
And say, ""Help me to be strong.""

Bridge
I know You didn't bring me out here
To leave me lonely
Even when I can't see clearly
I know that You are with me,
So I can't..."
768;I Can, I Will, I Do Believe;;"I can, I will, I do believe,
I can, I will, I do believe;
I can, I will, I do believe
That Jesus heals me now.
(I'm trusting only in the Lord...)"
769;I Come To The Garden Alone;;"I come to the garden alone,
While the dew is still on the roses,
And the voice I hear,
Falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses

Chorus
And He walks with me,
And He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own,
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known

He speaks, and the sound of His voice,
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
And the melody,
That He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be falling,
But He bids me go,
Through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling"

No longer in the darkness  and  no move will i stray

772;I Could Still Go Free;;"Verse 1
Lock me up in a prison
And throw away the key
Take away the vision,
From these eyes,
That can see;

Verse 1
You can deprive me,
Of the food I eat
And even bind my hands and feet
But as long as I know Jesus,
Then I can still go free.

Chorus
That I could still go free
Tell me what kind of a man,
Would reach down his hand
And do this for me, (for me);

Chorus
So unworthy to live,
And not fit to kill
But the man of the cross,
Had my name in His Will,
He said I could still go free.

Verse 2
Now I never could quite understand
Why the King could leave His Throne
To adorn the robe of earthly man,
Feel the pain in flesh, flesh and born;

Verse 2
Then to later trod down
That lonely path,
That led to calvary,
Where those blood red stains,
Drop all the chains,
That I could still go free."

And to walk with Thee
Is not grievous unto me;
I delight to do Thy Will."

I do believe, I now believe
That Jesus died for me;

Verse 1
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;
No other help I know.
If Thou withdraw thyself from me,
Ah, whither shall I go?

Verse 2
What did Thine only Son endure
Before I drew my breath!
What pain, what labor,
To secure my soul from endless death!

Verse 3
Author of faith, to Thee I lift
My weary, longing eyes.
Oh, let me now receive that gift;
My soul, without it, dies.

Verse 4
Surely Thou canst not let me die;
Oh, speak, and I shall live.
And here I will unwearied lie
Till Thou Thy Spirit give.

Could I but see Thy face!

And taste Thy pard'ning grace."

It's only an indication of His great love,
and how much He cares.

Like to Abraham, He came down
In this day unto me.
Showing me things that were
and things that are, and things,
things that are to be.
What has been hidden from the eyes
of the wise and the prudent,
He has revealed unto His own;
A message of preparation,
to take us to our eternal home.

When I think that I'm one in a million
Chosen by God to stand in this evil day,
It fills my heart with love for the
Heavenly Dove who has led me,
In God's provided way.
I, who was dead in sins and trespasses,
so wretched, so wretched and so vile,
It took His Amazing Grace, to lift me
to a place that He now calls me,
Calls me His Bride.

When I see all hell extending her borders
to swallow up humanity,
I thank the One with the keys of death and hell,
Who has opened the prison door for me.
He has changed my course
From the regions of the lost, that realm of insanity,
By anointing my eyes with a Heavenly vision
To behold and live eternally."

shall be mine,
I feel like traveling on.

Let others seek a home below,
I feel like traveling on;
Which flames devour,
Or waves o'er flow,
I feel like traveling on.

The Lord has been so
good to me,
I feel like traveling on;
Until that blessed home I see,
I feel like traveling on."

I feel the pull inside of my celestial home
The deep in me is calling me to that eternal place
I feel the pull inside of my celestial home
The deep in me is drawing me to that eternal place

There is a cry for revelation
A need to know as we were always known
For it won't be long again you can see we are at the end
Slack not your riding continue to sigh and cry
You must have that Token to take that heavenly flight

Though we've grieved by various trials
That the genuiness of our faith may be tried
For at the end of our faith
We'll receive salvation for our soul
A glorious body a Son in the image of the Word
United with theophany
We'll be one with the living God

Holding to a solid rock
A strong assurance that he gave me
And i cannot be lost
Let the storm of the water
Of this life dash about
I'm anchored to the solid rock} x2

When in his likeness I abide

They had an anchor steadfast

and Jesus is His name
He's the one the bible tells us
He heals the blind the sick and lame
And since, I found this friend I
have never been the same
All I know I wanna do is to glorify His name


Many times when I'm in trouble
I call upon His name
And He has never been too busy
He just listens again
Then He sends living waters to
flow from deep within
Making it easy to forget how
troubled I have been


And when I talk to Him in
prayer everyday
He listens patiently to every
word I have to say
He will never, no never ever turn me away
Cause He is my best friend
and will be unto the end
Oh yes He is my best friend and
will be unto the end"
799;I Have Found Him;;"Verse 1
Jesus Christ is my Savior,
When I was in sin he came in human flesh,
He who is the Almighty condescended and became feeble
And he paid the price for my sins and my sicknesses
I can sing and shout: by His stripes we are healed

Chorus
Its not because of what I did but its by His mercy that I am on my way to heaven
Its by his grace x2
God hides and reveals himself in simplicity in this end time,
Like our mother, the great Elohim incarnated in his bride discerning the thoughts of the heart
I have found grace and he has changed my life,
And now I can sing and shout

Verse 2
My brother and my sister, you have problem and worries of this world yet you believe the message of William Branham

He was there to see me through
And said if you will trust me
That's all you have to do.

Chorus
I've learnt to trust Him
I've learnt to trust Him
In every step I take
He walks with me
On mountains high above
In valleys so deep and low
Wherever that I may go
I've learnt to trust Him.

He gave me love
That I had never known before
When no one wanted me
And they kicked me from their doors
It made me sad, but soon I was glad
To know that One loved me
And that Same One loved me
Even eternally."

Of sinfulness,
But I daily tread
The paths of righteousness.
Since the day the Lord
Has come to my life to bless.

That always last.
And reject sin's pleasures,
That will soon be past.
To the treasures of true worth,
I'm holding fast.

Others may deny the Lord
And live in sin.
But the race that I have entered
I must win.
Thro' the pearly gates,
I mean to enter in.
I have settled the question forever."

I heard the bells on Christmas day,
Their old familiar carols play;
And wild and sweet the words repeat,
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Verse 2
I thought how as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom;
Had rolled along the unbroken song,
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Verse 3
And in despair I bowed my head,
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said;
""For hate is strong and mocks the song,
Of peace on earth, good will to men.""

Verse 4
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep,
""God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With peace on earth, good will to men.""

The world revolved from night to day;
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men."

And ''Perfect Faith''
''The Breach'' and
''The Message of Grace''

You have been through every thing disheartening

816;I Know My Redeemer Lives;;"Job was on his ash heap
His afflictions and trials strong
His health, his wealth, his family
Everything he had was gone
But as he looked out unto the mountains
And the lilies out in the fields
The Prophet said Job caught a vision of the Seventh Seal

CHORUS
Job said I know that my Redeemer lives
He'll stand in the later day
Though the worms may eat this body
I'll rise again some day
For as a grain of wheat falls to the ground
It withers and it dies
At Easter time it springs again
Bringing forth new life

Noah built the ark and did
Exactly as God had said
But it seemed like time would prove him wrong
He preached a hundred and twenty years
But as the sky grew dark and the winds blew strong
And the rain came falling down
I can hear old Noah rejoice and sing
That happy Easter song

CHORUS

He said I know that my Redeemer lives
The ark will rest some day
Though around me wave and billows roll
And all life will pass away
As a grain of wheat falls to the ground
It withers and it dies
At Easter time it springs again
Bringing forth new life

Jesus walked the lonely road
That led to Calvary
He looked so very defeated
As He hung there on the tree
But He said no man can take my life
I freely lay it down
Yes there had to be a Calvary
For an Easter time to come

CHORUS

Yes, I know that my Redeemer lives
He'll take me home some day
Through the storms of life
The toils and strife
I will praise Him anyway
For as a grain of wheat falls to the ground
It withers and it dies
At Easter time He rose again
To give us back His life"

I know the Lord will make a way for me
If I Iive a holy life shun The wrong and do the right

I know my Lord will make a way for me
If I Iive a holy life shun The wrong and do the right

If I hold to His hand
And live by His commands
I know the Lord will fix it for you.


When I was in bondage
I just couldn't seem to be free.
I bowed down on my knees
And prayed to the Lord
And He delivered me
Now if I hold to His hand
And live by His commands
I know the Lord will fix it for me (x2)"
820;I Know Whom I Have Believed;;"I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

CHORUS
But I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day.

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus thro' the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air."

For there's joy, joy in my soul."
824;I Long To See Jesus;;"I came from God and I go back to God
I am a true manifestation of the thoughts of my Father
Though I was lost and sinking in sin
But Jesus died on the cross of calvary
And bought my salvation

Chorus
So one thing for sure, I really long to see Jesus
To sit by His side to look at His face
And express my gratitude, to the One who died
To purchase my salvation, I long for that day
When I'll be with Jesus and say Lord I love You

I am a pilgrim, and I am a stranger
Wandering through this world of pain, sin and shame
But I know there's a better place where I've been before
I cannot wait to go back to that place
To live there eternally"

CHORUS
I love Him, I love Him
Because He first loved me
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary's tree.

Once I was lost, and 'way
down deep in sin,
Once was a slave to passions
fierce within;
Once was afraid to
trust a loving God;
But now I'm cleansed from every
stain through Jesus' blood.

Once I was bound,
but now I am set free;
Once, I was blind, but now
the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now
in Christ I live,
To tell the world around
the peace that He doth give."

828;I Love Him Too Much;;"When I first heard of Jesus
His love and His Grace
My heart was overwhelmed
To think a King would take my place
I cried Lord I'll go with you.
Every step of the way
That's all I can do
My debt to repay

CHORUS
I love Him too much
To fail Him now
I love Him too much
To break my bond
For I promised
The Lord that I would make
it somehow
And I love Him too much
To fail Him now

When I told Him I loved Him,
It was so easy to say
But harder to prove, when
temptation came my way
All my good unbroken promises
I counted it but lost
When I caught a glimpse of true love
Hanging on a rugged cross

And now the years have drawn us closer
My love for Him has grown
Each step has brought me near,
to my eternal home
And now its too close to Heaven
to turn back now
He said His Grace would be sufficient
I'm gonna make it somehow."

God's wonderful people."
832;I Love This Living;;"I love this living for Him
I love this calling the Savior my Friend
Looking back to where I've been
I love this living, I love this living for Him

Since the day that I met Him
Since the brand new start
Since the sweet surrender of my heart
Closer than a brother
The Lord has been to me
There will never be another
Life I lead

Now some days are a struggle
I'll admit, there's been a few
But in the midst of trouble
His love holds true
And if I'll just keep trusting
I'll see the light of day
It's all a part of walking
This gospel way

More wonderful it seems
Than all the golden fancies
Of all our golden dreams.

It did so much for me;
And that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee

I love to tell the story;
'Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems each time I tell it,
More wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story;
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God's own holy word.

I love to tell the story;
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
I sing the new, new song,
'Twill be the old, old story,
That I have loved so long."

Oh, I love to walk with Jesus,
Like the publicans of old.
When He gathered them about Him
And the blessed tidings told:
How He came to bring deliv'rance
To the captives in distress.
Take away our ev'ry burden,
Giving perfect peace and rest.

Verse 2
O I love to walk with Jesus
Like the man of long ago
Who had tarried by the wayside
Near the gates of Jericho.
Jesus heard his cry for mercy,
Gave him back his sight that day,
And immediately he followed Jesus
All along the way.

Verse 3
O I love to walk with Jesus
All the way to Calv'ry's brow,
Gaze upon that scene of suff'ring
While my tears of sorrow flow.
There He tells me how He loves me,
Takes my ev'ry sin away;
So I follow Him so gladly,
Lead me anywhere He may.

Verse 4
O sometime I'll walk with Jesus
In the land of endless day,
When our journey here is over

Sing His praises o'er and o'er,
And with all the saints in glory
Love and worship and adore."

CHORUS
I love you Lord although I'm not
worthy
I'm not worthy for the price you
paid for me
And I could never repay
But I can just say Lord I love Thee

Why He loved me so
I really don't know
But I know He cares for me
Oh and I had never known
The love that He had shown
When He died upon the cross
for worthless me
And I could never repay
But i can just say

Verse 1
How I longed to see you again (for deliverance)
But you

And you have forgiven and given me a heart
That I could love (serve) you Lord

Verse 2
Satan schemed against me, to take me from my place
Tried to destroy me, in my weakest moment
He said I would surely die
That I could never be bride
And I believed him for a while
But you made a way
That I could tell you

You raised me up so high to see
The secrets of you heart
And I can only say

And His footsteps follow still.

I must have the Saviour with me,
For my faith at best is weak,
He can whisper words of comfort,
That no other voice can speak.

I must have the Saviour with me,
In the onward march of life,
Through the tempest and the sunshine,
Through the battle and the strife.

I must have the Saviour with me,
And His Eye the way must guide,
Till I reach the vale of Jordan,
Till I cross the rolling tide."

One who can help
my burdens to bear;

Over the world the

I have heard how Christians long ago
Were brought before a tyrant's throne;
They were told that he would spare their lives
If they would renounce the name of Christ;

verse 1
But one by one
they chose to die
The Son of God
they would not deny;
Like a great angelic choir sing,
I can almost hear their voices ring

CHORUS
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb,
With all my strength, with all I am
I will seek to honour His command
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb.

verse 2
Now the years have come,
And the years have gone,
But the cause of Jesus still goes on;
Now the time has come to count the cost,
To reject this world,
To embrace the Cross,

verse 2
And one by one,
let us give our lives,
For the One who died to give us life;
Till the Trumpet sounds on that final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say.

verse 3
To the lamb of God,
Who bore my pain,
Who took my place,
Who wore my shame,
I will seek to honour His command;
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb."

FROM THE SLAUGHTER OF KINGS, HE MET THE UNSEEN KING OF SALEM.

HAVING NEITHER BEGINING OF DAYS AND END OF LIFE.
EVEN HIS NEPHEW LOT MUST HAVE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD IN DISBELIEF,
HOW COULD AUNCLE DEFEAT THE ALLIED FORCES.

CHORUS
THAT
AND NOT BY SIGHT IN THIS MOST EVIL AGE.
I HAVE GOT THE MECHANICS BUT WITHOUT THE DYNAMICS
TO KEEP ME MARCHING ALONG THE KING

I REMEMBER MANY YEARS AGO WHEN MOSES WAS UNDOUBTEDLY
TO BE COME THE NEXT PHARAOH, WITH THE KINGSHIP OF THE ENTIRE
WORLD ALL IN HIS HANDS BUT HE CHOSE TO LOOK AT THE UNSEEN.
HAVING LOOKED AT THE UNSEEN, HE HAD TESTED SHIKINAH GLORY
FOR HE WAS YOURS BY ELECTION AND NOT BY JOINING.
EVEN THE RULLING PHARAOH MUST HAVE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
IN DISBELIEF, HOW COULD MOSES TURN DOWN SUCH AN OFFER."

He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

Oh, I delight in His command,
Love to be lead by His dear hand;
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.

Onward I go, no doubt, nor fear,
Happy with Christ my Savior near,
Trusting that I some day shall see,
Jesus, my Friend of Calvary."

Coming down from the sky;
How art thou fallen son of the morning,

You were the one who
Brought this world in so much
Praise God your power has been broken,
When our Lord, our mighty
Freed us from sin;
Now I look unto redemption,
The abstract title deed has come;
Showing me that way unto
For this wicked world of sin I'll overcome.
I'll sit with my Father in His
I'll reign with Him one thousand years,
Where there's no sickness, or sadness;

You were the one upon those
White and red, black and pale,
Praise God your power has been broken,
Since those Seven Seals have been unveiled,
You have failed;

The abstract title deed has come
Showing me that way unto
For this wicked world of sin I'll overcome;

I'll reign with Him one thousand years,
Where there's no sickness, or sadness;
Only joy, no more fears,
No more tears."

I see so much imperfection
Shown to me by the devil, my enemy;

Trying to get me sad, and depressed
But I stand right upon my two feet
I look at him straight in the eye
And I say...

verse 4
Now He has said we will be raptured
To fly away in the sky
And discover the seventh dimension
But we can still feel the force of gravity
Trying to keep us down in this world;

And get fixed up in this world
But I stand right upon my two feet
Raise my hands challenging gravity
And I say...

Where sin's demands were paid,
And rays of hope for tomorrow
Across our path were laid.

CHORUS
I see a crimson stream of blood.
It flows from Calvary,
Its waves which reach
the throne of God,
Are sweeping over me.

Today no condemnation
Abides to turn away
My soul from His salvation,
He's in my heart to stay.

When gloom and sadness whisper
You've sinned, no use to pray,
I look away to Jesus,
And He tells me to say:

And when we reach the portal
Where life forever reigns,
The ransomed hosts grand final
Will be this glad refrain."

To welcome me.

CHORUS
I shall know Him, I shall know Him,
As redeemed by His side I shall stand,
I shall know Him, I shall know Him
By the prints of the nails in His hands.

O the soul-thrilling rapture
When I view His blessed face
And the luster of His kindly
beaming eye;
How my full heart will praise Him
For the mercy, love and grace
That prepare for me
A mansion   in the sky.

O the dear ones in glory,
How they beckon me to come,
And our parting
At the river I recall;
To the sweet vales of Eden
They will sing my welcome home
But I long to meet
My Savior first of all.

Thru the gates to the city,
In a robe of spotless white,
He will lead me where
No tears will ever fall;
In the glad song of ages
I shall mingle with delight
But I long to meet
My Savior first of all."

Though my trials have been much,
I'm not given unto death.
And because I must declare Your name,
I shall not die but live.

Though I be cast into prison,
Fleeing temptation, standing for my Lord,
Yet the things that God has shown me
Shall come to pass,
And His glory shall be my reward.

I shall not die but live,
Live and declare Thy works oh God.
Though my temptations have
I'm not given unto death,
And because I must declare Your name,

Though I be in the midst of trouble,
Hear my cry Lord, save my soul,
For though I'm cast out of Thy sight, Lord;
Yet raise me up;
For I must declare Your name to a dying world.

Into Canaan's land,
The Lord His riches gave
So full on every hand;

And dwelt a happy band,

The prayer of faith to hear,
And then He'll send the blessing."

I have heard about heaven
And I want to go there
Where those beautiful flowers
Bloom so wonderful there

Far beyond compare
Yes I've heard about heaven
And I want to go there

Also happy and blest
To that city eternal
Where pure waters flow
There'll be no more dying
There'll be no more pain
Yes I've heard about heaven
And I want to go there"

I want to know
Lord I want to know
That I am pleasing you


verse 1
I
Through times of joy and pain
How I long just once more
To feel your power move again
To no more have my own way
But in all things be still
In full obedience to your word
United with you my head

verse 2
We
unleavened bread
With sincerity and truth
Giving you all our strength
In the days of our youth
Hiding your word in our heart

As we grow into the image of
your word
May your life be reflected in us

880;I Want To Know You More;;"Verse 1
Just the time I feel that I've been caught in the mire of self
Just the time I feel my mind's been bought by worldly wealth
That's when the breeze begins to blow
I know the Spirit's call
And all my worldly wonderings just melt within His love.

Verse 2
Oh, I want to know you more
Deep within my soul I want to know you
Oh, I want to know you, to feel your heart and know your mind
Looking in your eyes, stirs up within me
Cries that say, ""I want to know you"",
Oh, I want to know you more.

Verse 3
And when my daily deeds ordinarily lose life and song
My heart begins to bleed sensitivity to Him is gone
I've run the race but sent my own pace and face a shattered soul
But the gentle arms of Jesus, warm my hunger to behold.

Verse 4
Oh, I want to know you more
Deep within my soul I want to know you
Oh, I want to know you
And I would give my final breath
To know you in your death and resurrection
Oh, I want to know you more.

Verse 5

881;I Want To Live;;"Verse 1
There've been times when giving,
And loving brought pain,
And I promised I would never,
Let it happen again;

Verse 1
But I found out, that loving,
Was well worth the risk,
And that even in losing I'll win.

CHORUS
I want to live the way
He wants me to live;
I want to give,
Until there's just no more to give;

Chorus
I want to love, love,
Till there's just no more love;
I could never, ever out love the Lord.

Verse 2
Jesus showed us that only
Through dying we live,
And He gave, when it seemed
There was no more to give;

Verse 2
Jesus loved when loving
Brought heartache and loss;
And He forgave from
the old rugged Cross.

chorus
I want to live the way
He wants me to live;
I want to give,
Until there's just no more to give;
I want to love, love,
Till there's just no more love;
I could never, ever out love the Lord."
882;I Want To Rise Up;;"As I strive daily Lord to see Your Word perfected,
Help me be so deeply sincere from within;
For I know this is my time for consecration,
And I must lay aside my every weight and sin.

CHORUS
So I can rise up on the wings of faith
And soar the Heavens wide.
So I can live in heavenly places,
Far beyond the clouds and skies.
So I can see like the eagles,
The things God sees from up above,
Just to follow in the way of the Dove.

Seeing Lord, You've given me a path to follow,
And You showed me just what I was called unto,
Lord, prepare me to be always in Your service,
A true service unto You I want to do."
883;I Was Born To Declare Your Life;;"Verse 1
For this cause I came
For this purpose I was born
That I will manifest the life of the living God
It's not my will but thine oh Lord
So I lay it all on the altar
That my life may be a sacrifice offered unto you.

Chorus
I was born to declare your life
And the reason of your death
Here I am to pay the price
Fully surrendering to your will
I only (I only wanted Lord to declare your victory)
I only (I only wanted Lord to be surrendered unto thee)

Verse 2
In this age we see through the opening of the Word
That we must overcome all life's challenges
The pride of life, lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes
And stand to manifest the life of Jesus Christ.

Verse 3
Lord you said unto your prophet
Be more sincere
He spoke and did create with the Word
""Let there be.""
All of these great things that you did in his life
I will see in it's fullness as your life unfolds in mine."
884;I Was Born To Serve;;"From the dust of the earth,
My God formed this body,
His breath made me a living soul;
And then the light of His Word
Struck the germ deep inside me,
That is why, that is why I love Him
so.

CHORUS
For I was made in His likeness,
Created in His image,
For I was born to serve the Lord;
And I can't deny Him,
I will always walk beside Him,
For I was born to serve the Lord.

My hands, they were made to serve His people,
My eyes, they were made to read
My feet, they were made to walk in His
And my body is the temple of the Lord.

Whom He foreknew, He did predestinate,
To be conformed into His image,
Whom He foreknew, it's them He also
Whom He called, He did justify;
Whom He justified, He has glorified,
And I'm waiting for the translation
to meet my Lord."
885;I Was Glad;;"I was glad when they said unto me,
I was glad when they said unto me,
I was glad when they said unto me,
""Let us go into the house of the Lord."""
886;I Was On His Mind;;"There's no one great amongst us,
We're nothing on our own,
We make mistakes, and often slip,
Just common flesh and bone;
But someday, I'll prove just why I say,
I'm of a special kind,
For while He was on the Cross
I was on His mind.

CHORUS
For, He knew me,
Yet, He loved me,`
He whose glory makes the heavens shine.
I am so unworthy of such mercy,
Yet, while He was on the Cross
I was on His mind.

The look of love was on His face,
The thorns were on His head,
Blood was on His scarlet robe,
Stained in crimson red;
Though His eye was on the crowd that
He looked ahead in time,
And while He was on the cross
I was on His mind."
887;I Was There When It Happened;;"Chorus 1
I was there when it happened,
And I ought to know,
His Spirit burning in me,
Set my heart aglow,
So I praise the Lord today.

Verse 1
You ask me how I know that Jesus saves me,
How I know that all my sins are white as snow.
You ask me how I know that He forgave me,
Now listen I must tell you how I know.

Verse 2
You ask me how I know that He redeemed me,
And how I received the peace no gold can buy.
How from the guilt and pow'r of sin He saved me,
Made me an heir to mansions in the sky.

Verse 3
And now as thru the world I go rejoicing,
I am telling what a Savior dwells within.
How I plunged into the cleansing crimson fountain,
And Jesus washed my soul from ev'ry sin."
888;I Will Bless The Lord;;"I will bless the Lord at all times,
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.

And delivered me from all my fears."

To function the way you want us to

The Seven Seals of our lives
are no longer sealed
We are the word made plain

Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His blood has washed away
each stain.

Though the way seems straight
and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;

Way back to your former rain
When you once stood in position
Having dominion and all things under your feet

So you cry out, you thirst for that latter rain
And you'll fight for that power again.

CHORUS
I will rise for my everlasting prize.
There's a resurrection promise in my eyes.
At the dawn I believe that I'll be good as gone.
It'll come as no surprise.  I know that I will rise.

There are scoffers all around that say that everything's just the same.
And the promise they will laugh and criticize.
But one day they'll see that gravity is gonna lose it's hold on me.
They don't realize everything in Christ will rise.

I will rise. I will rise. I will rise."

As Your love and grace demand.

Thorns on His head
Spear in His side

If Jesus Himself
Was standing here
Face full of glory
And eyes full of tears
And He held out His arms
Nail prints in his hands
Is there any way
You could say no to this Man.


Chorus
How can you look
In His tear-stained eyes
Knowing it's you He's thinking of
Could you tell Him you're not ready
To give Him your life
Could you tell Him
You don't really want His love.


Verse 2
Jesus is here with His arms open wide
You could see Him with your heart
If you quit looking with your eyes
He's left it up to you
He's done all that He can
Is there any way
You could say no to this Man

Your life in His hands

You could say no to this Man) X2

Threw His loving arms around me,
Drew me back into the way.

I was bruised but Jesus healed me,
Faint was I from many a fall,
Sight was gone,
And fears possessed me,
But He freed me from them all.

Soon He'll come the Lord of Glory,
Come the church His bride to claim,
And complete the wondrous story,

Rolls its waters at my feet;

Where the loved ones I shall meet."

When it seems that my friends

How did David fight Goliath?
With a simple sling in his hand, the Lord came down on the scene,
The angel of the Lord fought for David
And he had his victory

How did Moses overcome Egypt?
With a simple rod in his hand,
It is the Lord who came down on the scene
And led Moses out of Egypt,
The angel of the lord fought for Moses
And he had his victory

Lord fill my heart with your presence,
Put yourself between the sickness and my body,
Put yourself between the sin and my life,
Oh, Jesus fights for me and I will always have the victory.

The Angel of the lord has come in this age,
revealing the mystery of the 7 thunders, and it's the final victory of

Someday when Life is over
And I've said my last goodbye
I'll see my Saviour standing, at the Door

Till Jesus came and
made me whole,
I would not be denied.

As Jacob in the days of old,
I wrestled with the Lord;

a courage bold,
I stood upon His Word.

Old Satan said my Lord
was gone
And would not hear my prayer,
But, praise the Lord!
The work is done
And Christ the Lord is here."
913;I'd Like To Talk It Over With Him;;"Some morning when I stand
in God's wonderful city
Where the light from heaven's
glory will never grow dim

Saviour who gave me life eternal
And I'd love to talk it over with Him.


Chorus
I'd love to kneel down and talk
it all over with Him
I'd love to say Lord, you loved
me when my path was so dim
I cannot repay Him when I meet
Him in that city of gold
Lord I'd love to talk it over
And thank Him for His wonderful love.


We'll be singing Halleluahs

Him some deep tears and sorrow
And I'd love to talk it over with Him."

There is nothing like religion
In the good old-fashioned way;
I am walking in the old-time way,
And I want the world to know
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

CHORUS
I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know,
There's nothing like an old-time  Christian
With a Christian love to show;
I'm walking in the grand old highway,
And I'm telling everywhere I go,
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

There are many things I'd like to be
As my journey I pursue,
I have longed to be a leader
Like a mortal man would do;
I would like to be a millionaire,
With a million to bestow,
But I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know.

All the world is bright since I got right,
Now I sing and pray and shout,
All my burdens have been lifted
Since the Saviour brought me out;
I will tell the world both far and near
As I travel here below,
That I'd rather be an old-time Christian
Than anything I know."

Changed in a moment to live in a higher realm

What these intelligent Beings are
So they call them UFOs
But my prophet told me and I
They

And though other mortals look like me
They
Cause I belong to an eternal order
And to a world unseen
Associated with the supernatural And heavenly beings"
916;I'll Be Listening;;"When the Saviour calls
I will answer,
When He calls for me
I will hear;
When the Saviour calls
I will answer,
I'll be somewhere
list'ning for my name.

CHORUS
I'll be somewhere list'ning,
{for my name}

If my heart is right when He calls me,
If my heart is right I will hear
If my heart is right when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name.

If my robe is white when He calls me,
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white when He calls Me.
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name."
917;I'll Fly Away;;"Some glad morning
When this life is o'er
I'll fly away,
To a home on God's
celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away, oh glory,
I'll fly away;
When i die,
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows
Of this life have grown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird from prison
bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more
Weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys
shall never end,
I'll fly away."
918;I'll Go The Distance;;"The Bible clearly says
That in the latter days
Some will abandon their faith in God
And follow other ways;
But I have set my course
And I will make it thru;
I choose to walk this narrow way;
The road that leads to You.

Chorus
I
I will not compromise,
Pressing on to win the prize;
In Christ Jesus,
I

Whatever You require
Lord that
Nothing I could gain on earth
Better than knowing You
So when the days grow dark
And the world that seems so steep;
I trust Your Word to be my light
And I

919;I'll Go Where You Want Me To Go;;"It may not be on the mountain's height,
Or over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle's front
My Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still, small voice He calls
To paths I do not know,
I'll answer dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I'll go where you want me to go.

Chorus
I'll go where you want me to go , dear Lord
O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord,
I'll be what you want me to be.

Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand'rer whom I should seek,
Oh Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide,
Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I'll say what you want me to say.

There's surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth's harvest-fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life's short day
For Jesus, the Crucified.
So, trusting my all unto Thy care,
I know Thou lovest me!
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I'll be what you want me to be."
920;I'll Introduce To You This Friend Of Mine;;"I cannot say I've known a lot of men of wealth or fame.
But, I know One Who placed the stars, and called them all by name.
I met this Friend some time ago, He made my life, anew;
If you'll wait just a minute, I'll introduce my Lord to you.

Chorus
I'll introduce you to this Friend of mine.
His Name is Jesus, He's with me all the time.
You'll learn to like Him, You'll Love Him, like I do;
If you'll wait just a minute, I'll introduce my Lord to you.

The life I lived was meaningless, I did that which was wrong.
To me, life was a tragedy and hatred was it's home.
True Happiness was just a dream, then my Lord made it all come true;
So, if you'll wait just a minute, I'll introduce my Lord to you."
921;I'll Just Still Away;;"Every time I do a thing I
should not do
Every time I say a word I
should not say
Let me tell you what I'll do
Then He brings the blessings
too
I'll just still away somewhere
and pray.

chorus
I'll just still away
I'll just still away
And I ask my precious Lord
to lead the way
I'll just still away
I'll just still away
I'll just still away somewhere
and pray.

Precious savior always hears
As I'm just praying
And He gives me many
blessings everyday
When I try to do my best
And I fail to pass the test
I'll just still away somewhere
and pray."
922;I'll Keep Pressing On;;"Like my forefathers did and their fathers before them
They kept the Word of God within their hearts
Through tears and toils they fought with conviction in their souls
Now their children have an inheritance
The faith of the Lord

CHORUS
For whatever it takes I'll keep pressing on
Whatever trials come my way I'll be pressing further
For what shall separate me from the love of Christ Jesus my Lord
I've counted the cost, I'll pick up my cross
And keep pressing on
I'll finish my course with joy  (2x)

Like my sister Ruth it is within my make-up
To fulfill the task Adam did not fulfill
For such a time as this I must bring forth this Christ child
And be perseverant in spite of all obstacles

And whatever it takes I'll keep pressing on
Whatever trials Satan throws my way I'll keep pressing on
What shall separate me from the love of Christ Jesus my Lord
I've counted the cost, I'll pick up my cross
And keep pressing on the finish my course with joy"
923;I'll Meet You;;"I will meet you in the morning, by t
he bright river side,
When all sorrow has drifted away;
I'll be standing at the portals, when
the gates open wide,
At the close of life's long, dreary day.

CHORUS
I'll meet you in the morning with a
""How do you do,""
And we'll sit down by the river and
with rapture ""auld"" acquaintance
renew,
You'll know me in the morning, by
the smiles that I wear,
When I meet you in the morning, in
the city that is built foursquare.

I will meet you in the morning, in the
sweet by and by,
And exchange the old cross for
a crown;
There will be no disappointments and
nobody shall die,
In that land, e'er the sun goeth down.

I will meet you in the morning, at the
end of the way,
On the streets of that city of gold;
Where we all can be together and be
happy for aye,
While the years and the ages shall roll."
924;I'll Praise Him For What He's Done;;"I'll praise Him
For what He's done for me,
I'll praise Him
Through all eternity,
I will never doubt Him,
I cannot live without Him,
What a wonderful friend is He."
925;I'll Rise Again;;"Go ahead ,drive the nails in my hands
Laugh at me ,where you stand
Go ahead and say it isn't me
The day will come when you will see

Chorus1
'Cause I'll rise again
Ain't no power on earth
Can keep me down
Yes I'll rise again
Death can't keep me
In the ground

Go ahead and mock my name
My love for you is still the same
Go ahead and bury me
But very soon I will be free

Go ahead and say I'm dead and gone
But you will see that you were wrong
Go ahead ,try to hide the Son
But all will see that I'm the one

Chorus2
'Cause I'll rise again
Ain't no power on earth
Can tie me down
Yes I'll come again
Gonna take my people back

Away from all my doubts and fears
Away from all my strife
And through the noises around me
I can hear your still small voice
Calling me to walk a little closer (2x)

Verse 2
Teach me how I must spend my time
As the days roll on
I need to know I'm growing
With the breaking of each dawn
Give me more of your Spirit
That I can live more conscious Lord
So I can walk a little closer (2x)

Verse 3
I've seen you broke the barriers down that separated us
Now in you I have more confidence
In you I've  learned to trust

I'll worship You, I'll worship You,
The reason I live is to worship You.
I'll worship You, I'll worship You,
The reason I live is to worship You.

When I look into Your holiness,
When I gaze into Your loveliness,
When all things that surround me
become shadowed in the light of You.

When I find the joy
that reaches Your heart,
And my will becomes
enthroned in Your love
When all things that surround me
become shadowed in the light of You."
929;I'm A New Creation;;"Hallelujah, He redeemed me,
I've been born again to win,
I thank God He justified me
Of His fullness have we all
received of Him.

I'm a new creation,
I'm a brand new man.
Old things are passed away,
I'm born again.
More than a conqueror
That's what I am,
I'm a new creation
I'm a brand new man!"
930;I'm A Pilgrim;;"I'm a pilgrim
There's a pathway meant just for me.
I only fumble when I won't follow
I only stumble when I won't see.

Chorus
Light of life
Shine on my pathway
Shepherd call me
Call me down the road
I'm coming, I'm coming
Though I bend beneath my load.

I am a stranger but not an orphan
There is a mansion prepared for me
I'm going home now to meetmy Father
I'm a member of His family.

I'm a pilgrim but not a rambler
And I'm on my way home
I am a stranger but not an orphan
And I'm on my way home"

No one knew how alone I was feeling,
And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide.
Though I laughed and said my life was fine without You.
I was covering up the secret tears I cried;

Verse 1
Then one day someone told me of Your mercies,
And the love You showed on a Hill called Calvary.
There You died and purchased my redemption,
When You broke sin's power and set my spirit free.

Chorus
I'm amazed that You love me I'm amazed how You care
Through Your precious blood I've found pardon
And my sins are washed they're all washed away
All my sins are washed away.

Verse 2
Yes there've been days when I've failed You.
Lord You know the many times I've gone astray.
But I've learned Your love is stronger than my weakness,
And Your ear is open every time I pray;

Verse 2
No one else has ever cared for me like You Lord.
Other friends could never be as close to me.
I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow,
Knowing You are everything I'll ever need."

By-passed my theophany
But I'm longing to get out of this house
To that body prepared for me
Where sickness, pain and death
Will all be history
A supernatural Word
That's what is changing me

CHORUS
From glory unto glory I'm being changed
Soon we'll lay aside this flesh
To enter eternal rest
I'm being changed (3x)
Putting on my theophany

I'm so tired of these dimensions
They're holding me earth and in time
I want to go to Mt. Zion
Where peace will all be mine
I can see the saints running over those hills
Just to greet me
We'll sing amazing grace
With the prophet under the evergreen tree

Make sure everything is intact
For soon he'll be coming back
I'm being changed putting on my theophany
Get your tickets in your hand
To join that big great heavenly clan
I'm being changed putting on my theophany
We'll sing in one accord
As he says welcome all aboard
I'm being changed putting on my theophany
Don't be late
Don't hesitate
For He'll be waiting at the eastern gate
I'm being changed putting on my theophany"

I'm happy as can be and
I'm feeling better all the time."
937;I'm Free;;"When I think of Jesus
This man who died for me; took my sins away
What made Him give his life?
What was the meaning of Amazing Grace?
I just couldn

This Bloody Lamb that was slain, for me
I could not believe
The suffering He bore; took my place, on that tree

Despised and rejected
It pleased the Father to, give His son, for my life
Smitten and afflicted
I am now a prisoner of Christ

I
To save me from the wrath, He covered me,
With His blood
Amazing Grace I see
Justified I stand;

Christ now dwells within

The Lamb gave me His life

and living here is too;
but if they say that I have to choose
between the two,
I'd go home, going home where I belong.

Chorus
While I'm here I'll serve Him glady
and sing Him all these songs
I'm  here but not for long;

Chorus
When I'm feeling lonely
and I'm feeling blue
it's such a joy to know that
I'm only passing through
I'm heading home, I'm going home where I belong.

Sometimes when I'm dreaming;
It comes as a surprise
And if you look and see that
homesick feeling in my eyes;
I'm going home where I belong.

One day if I'm sleeping
and death knocks on my door
and I'll awake to find that
I'm not homesick anymore
Coz I'll be home, I'll be home where I belong."
942;I'm Going Through;;"Lord, I have started to walk
in the light,
Shining upon me from
heaven so bright,
I bade the world and its
follies adieu,
I've started in Jesus and
I'm going through.

CHORUS
I'm going through, yes,
I'm going through,
I'll pay the price whatever
others do,
I'll take the way with the
Lord's despised few,
I'm going through, Jesus,
I'm going through.

Oh there are many who
start in the race,
But with the light refuse
to keep pace,
Others accept it because
it is new,
But not very many expect
to go through.

I'd rather walk with Jesus
alone,
Have for a pillow, like Jacob,
a stone;
Living each moment with His
face in view,
Than shrink from my pathway
and fail to go through.

O brother, now will you take
up the cross?
Give up the world and count
it as dross;
Sell all thou hast and give to
the poor,
Then go through with Jesus and
those who endure."

I'm going up
I'm going up

It won't be long,
I'm gonna be gone.

This old world is not getting better,
Every day it's getting worse,
So much fighting and confusion
Going on down here on earth,
But I don't let that bother me
Cause I'm not here to stay,
I know my Lord is coming soon
And I'll be called away.

It could be just any morning,
It could be at night or noon,
We don't know just when He's coming,
But we know He's coming soon.

I'm gonna get carried away
When I get carried away."
946;I'm Gonna Live The Way He Wants;;"There's been times when giving
and loving brought pain
And I promised I could never
let it happen again
But I found out that loving
was worth of the risk
And that even in losing you win.

Chorus
I'm gonna live the way
He wants me to live
I'm gonna give until there's
just no more to give
I'm gonna love, love till
there's just no more love
I could never, ever out love the Lord.

He showed us that only
through dying we live.
And He gave when it seems
there was nothing to give
He loved, when loving brought
heartaches and loss
And He forgave from an
old rugged cross."

He deserves every part
But very often we hold back some things
We should have given from the start
But I just wanna be His Bride
There is nothing to hide
Every corner of my life, I give
To let Him rule and let Him live.

Chorus
I'm gonna treat Hi like a King
Make Him Lord of everything
All the honour I can bring
I'm gonna treat Him like a King

Now I pray the world will see
That He means everything to me
I'll spend the rest of my life I live
Treating Him like Royalty
He is free to rule and reign
And my heart is His domain
While the world is praising other things
I'm gonna crown Him King of kings.

Now I have that everlasting joy within,
Since He came and took away my sin,
The moment that He blessed me,
He made me fully whole,
With that everlasting joy
Within my soul.

I'm drinking from the fountain
That floweth from on high,
A well of blessed waters
That never shall run dry,
I'm feasting on God's manna,
I'm praying day by day,
And that everlasting joy
Is here to stay.

I've heard the prophet's message,
I've placed it in my heart,
I've got the revelation
That never shall depart,
The Rapture is upon us,
The stage is set to go.
We have this precious promise
We all know."
953;I'm Looking For Change;;"I've come a long way,
I've had fears and doubts,
But in Your mind Lord,
You knew I couldn't live with them;
So You chose at this time,
To wave before me
The thing You knew would  make me
Give up myself and my thoughts.
It could never have worked by  my own works,
But of faith that it might be by  grace;
To the end the promise might be sure to all the seed,
Unto us, of the faith of Abraham.

CHORUS
I'm now looking for the promise of my new body,
As my earth quakes all my sin is shaken off;
The Holy Fire from above puts sin out of existence,
For Holiness cannot dwell
in sinful earth.2x

But while I am here living in this world, I live by the faith of the Son of God revealed in  me;
To believe His word and claim  what's my own,
By promise it was freely given  to me,
And when it seems that there's no hope, believe  in hope,
And consider not the things which my eyes see;
But look into the Word of God
That shall not pass away,
And its righteousness which is by faith.

I'm living in the day
When my desert is blossoming like a rose, I'm living in the day,
When my thorns are unfolding to leaves again,
True fellowship is being restored
It's the promise of the Lord;
I'm looking now for the promise of my change,
I'm looking now for the promise of my new body;
I'm looking now for the promise  of my change."
954;I'm Not Going To Remain Here;;"The devil fought me with thoughts
That I wasn't of the Bride
But then God whispered in my ear
Fear not you are My child
And in this world I see it's evil
Hell is poured out on the earth
And I know with God's assurance
That this world is not my home

CHORUS
I'm not going to remain here
Very soon I'll be home
Heavens doors will open for me
For this world is not my home

So I die within me daily
Till I see this change in me
And I'm longing for the day
That my Jesus I will see
So I'll trim my lamp
Lord fill with oil
My soul is desperate for Thee
I am waiting, I am homesick
Lord do this quick short work in me

CHORUSs
I'm not going to remain here
Very soon I'll be home
I am waiting, I am homesick
And I'm longing to go home

So take me up those seven steps
Till Your image I behold
In my soul I want to please You
Lord I ask You purge my soul
I don't need to speak in tongues
I just want Your perfect love
So separate me from all evil
That will keep me far from home

I'm not going to remain here
Very soon I'll be home
Lord separate me from all evil
That will keep me far from home"

Cause he lost a soul that he thought he had

Is that I stayed with Satan much to long

I'm running, I'm running
My running days will soon be over
I'm running, I've got to get in a hurry
I know I'm gonna make it to the other side

One of these days it won't be long now
Your going to look for me, but I'll be gone
When I get to heaven shall I look for you
If you want to get there you better run to

One of these days down here in Babylon
We're going to see the saints that sleepeth, the redeemed ones
One of these mornings in the twinkling of an eye

But Lord don't forsake me now;
All of Your mercies
I could never afford,
I'm undeserving of Your Love,
But love me, Lord.

CHORUS
For nobody here really knows me,
And no one here understands my fears,
And when I'm in trouble and I'm all alone,
Lord, only You can dry my tears.
O, if You should leave me,
Then where could I go
To find rest for my weary soul?
And because I'm so unworthy,
I love You even though
I'm undeserving of Your Love
But love me Lord.

I don't deserve the blood that You shed,
When You died on the cross in my stead,
And to think that each drop of blood that fell from Your brow,
Would reach down a drop a time
To cleanse my soul now;
I don't deserve the  place that You prepared
For my life when this world is o'er,
But take my love forever,
Your presence I adore,
I'm undeserving of Your Love,
But love me Lord."
963;I've Anchored In Jesus;;"Upon life's boundless ocean

And trust Him more.

CHORUS

The storms of life I'll brave,
I've anchored in Jesus,
I fear no wind or wave,

He keeps my soul from evil
And gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters
And bid their tumult cease;
My pilot and deliverer,
To Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him,
He's at my side,

He is my Friend and Savior,
In Him my anchor's cast,

And shields me from the blast;
By faith I'm looking upward
Beyond life's troubled sea,
There I behold a haven
Prepared for me."

All my life has been rearranged;
What a difference it makes
When the Lord has His way
All my life praise God,
Has been changed.

Tho' my sins were as scarlet
They're white as snow,
I was bound but today I am free;
I was lost in the darkness
But now I'm found,
I was blind but now I see.

When at last in His presence
I stand above,
He will wipe every tear
From my eyes;
And I'll thank Him for giving
A wretch like me,
A new home beyond the sky."

967;I've Come A Long Way;;"Verse 1
I've come a long way
I've had fears and doubts
But in your mind Lord
You knew I couldn't live with them
So you chose at this time
To wave before me
The things you knew would make me
Give up myself and my thoughts
It could never have worked by my own works
But of faith that it might be by grace
To the end the promise might be sure to all His seed
Unto us, of the faith of abraham.

Chorus
I'm now looking for the promise of my new body
As my earth quakes all my sin is shaken off
The Holy fire from above puts sin out of existence
For Holiness cannot dwell on sinful earth. (x2)

Verse 2
But while I am here living in this world,
I live by the faith of the son of
God revealed in me
To believe His word and to claim what's my own
By promise it was freely given to me
And when it seems that there is no hope,
believe in hope
And consider not the things which my eyes see
But look into the word of God that shall not pass away
And its righteousness which is by faith.

Verse 3
I'm living in the days
When my desert is blossoming like a rose
I'm living in the days
When my thorns are unfolding to lives again
True fellowship is being  restored
Its the promise of the Lord
I'm looking now for the promise of my change,
I'm looking now for the promise of my new body,
I'm looking now for the promise of my change."

till i can be the strength that I should be to those who are looking my way.

chorus:

If I don't draw from the fountain, how can the thirsty drink from me
If I don't keep my eyes from Jesus Christ , and the blind will never see.
to lead someone from far away, I need to walk close to Him each day.
If I don't draw from the fountain, How can the thirsty drink from me.

we are called to be a witness, we are called to be a light,

There're no stars in the sky,
And the sparrows can't fly,
If that isn't love,  then heaven's a myth;

The thief hanging by His side,
Then He spoke with love and compassion,
Then took him to paradise."

You can't get any farther, you're just losin' ground.""

But, I'm not givin' up, no, I'm not turnin' 'round,
By the grace of God, I'll win a shinin' crown someday.
Well, I'll keep holdin' on to that nail scarred hand;
I'm not givin' up, No, I'll keep goin' on.

Would you mind to tell me, there's been something bothering me?
Why is it that old devil just won't let God's children be?
You see he has purposed and determined to get right in the way;
And turn us from the way of life and lead our souls astray."
994;Im Not Of This World;;"If you can understand,
I've come from another world
Where the sons of God shout for joy
And the morning stars sing
I declare I was there my kind is
very rare
In His image I was made,
Before the foundations were laid
I'm of a super race who beheld
the Father's face

CHORUS
I am not of this world,
I was expressed into time,
I've come from another world,
Sent to be an end time sign,
I'm only here for a little while,
To prove and manifest His life
from another world,
I'm going back to that eternal
world

I came from another world,
Unseen by human eyes
I'm from another world
A parallel universe
Right now I'm standing here
But if you dare to bat your eyes
I might disappear, in the
twinkling of an eye
To that other world
That eternal world

I live in another world,
Where I'm influenced to praise
By My Theophany
That's been singing to me
There's a quickening power
That's been rapturing me
To a heavenly place,
A supernatural atmosphere
From that other world,
From that other world"

I am redeemed, I am redeemed
Jesus loosed the chains of sin
And set me free
I am redeemed, I am redeemed
Jesus loosed the chains of sin
And set me free.

Soon I'll live in a foreign land
But now I'm free according
To redemption's plan
Soon I'll join the robed in white,
The redeemed we'll sing a song
Holy Angels cannot sing.

Verse 2
Unresting, unhasting
And silent as light;
Nor wanting, nor wasting,
Thou rulest in might.
Thy justice, like mountains,
High soaring above;
Thy clouds, which are fountains
Of goodness and love.

Verse 3
To all, life Thou givest,
To both great and small;
In all, life Thou livest,
The true life of all;
We blossom and flourish
As leaves on the tree,
And wither and perish
But naught changeth Thee.

Verse 4

Thine angels adore Thee

Of light hideth Thee.

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This Cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

Verse 2
In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
'Til on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

Verse 3
There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

Verse 4
No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand."
998;In Death There's Victory;;"Verse 1
Up the hill with the load,
Jesus walked up Calvary's road.
No man took His life from Him,
For you and me He willingly gave.

Verse 1
In His mind, He held a vision,
It was of the resurrection,
Truly He paid death's price;
Our victory's complete
In the perfect sacrifice.

CHORUS
In death, in death,
In death, there's victory.
Self sacrifice means freedom,
And this is the way for me.
For the joy set before,
There's a cross to endure.
For real life, this I see,
That in death there's victory.

Verse 2
Abraham held the promise,
'In Isaac shall thy seed be called.'
He died to his own thinking,
When God told him sacrifice his boy;

Verse 2
Obedient unto death he was faithful,
Knowing resurrection was in the end.
This he said: ""The lad and I, we'll go worship,
And come to you again.""

Verse 3
By faith Jocebed placed Moses
In the mouth of death on the river Nile,
Pharaoh's daughter, finding him,
To the house of death she took the child;

Verse 3
There he lived with those who sought his life,
And to the desert he had to flee,
Where he died to his own
To lead Israel to their victory.

Verse 4
Tell me now, Bride of Christ,
We're not different, we must pay the price,
As we lift up our cross,
Though we suffer and our lives are lost;

Verse 4
Yet we must die to ourselves and sin,
Truly become a burnt-offering,
But it's sure in the end,
That we will rise again."
999;In Everything;;"Of all the good things that have come his way,
It is no wonder you can hear Job say,
""The Lord giveth and taketh away,
I'll still give Him thanks;""
But when the table was all turned around,
And Job's world came crashing down;
His faith in God caused Job to say,
""I'll still give Him thanks.""

CHORUS
In everything give Him }
thanks,                        }
Give Him thanks,         }2x
In the good times praise His name,
In the bad times do the same,
In everything give the King of Kings, All the thanks.

When trouble comes and there's no one around,
Satan, he tries to tell me that my God let me down;
Through every dark hour the best thing I've found,
It was to give God the thanks.
For He has never, never, never failed  me yet,
So why should I start now to worry or fret;
In everything I will never forget,
To give God the thanks."
1000;In God I Trust;;"In God I trust to always give me faith
In God I trust to drive away my fears

chorus
That He'll be there
When darkness falls upon me
To give me light and guide me
Through life's raging sea
Becomes a worthless place
I'll be with him above
In God I trust

In God I trust to make me understand
In God I trust to always hold my hands
And take by his hand
In God I trust"
1001;In Heavenly Love Abiding;;"Verse 1
In heavenly love abiding,
No change my heart shall fear;
And safe is such confiding,
For nothing changes here:
The storm may roar without me,
My heart may low be laid;
But God is round about me,
And can I be dismayed?

Verse 2
Wherever He may guide me,
No want shall turn me back;
My Shepherd is beside me,
And nothing can I lack:
His wisdom ever waketh,
His sight is never dim;
He knows the way He taketh,
And I will walk with Him.

Verse 3
Green pastures are before me,
Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be o'er me,
Where darkest clouds have been;
My hope I cannot measure,
My path to life is free;
My Saviour has my treasure,
And He will walkt with me."
1002;In His Pavilion;;"In times of trouble and inward struggle
When it seems the end of the way,
Taking His direction,

I need to carry on,
In the secret of Your presence,
Beholding Your beauty, oh Lord.

In God's Word I'm reading, how my life

I'll greet the saints at heaven's door,
With a love I've never felt before,
What joy is waiting there for me.

But until then, I'll stay
In Your pavilion,
There I'll find the strength
I need to carry on;
In the secret of Your presence,
Beholding Your beauty oh Lord."

1011;In That City Where The Lamb Is The Light;;"There's a country far beyond
the starry sky;
There's a city where there
never comes a night;
If we're faithful we shall go
there by and by,
It's the city where the Lamp
is the light.

CHORUS
In that city where the Lamb
is the light,
The city where there cometh
no night;
I've a mansion over there,
and when free
From toil and care,
{I am going where the Lamb
is the light.} X2

Here we have our days of
sunshine, but we know
That the sun which shines
upon us now so bright
Will be changed to clouds and
rain until we go
To that city where the Lamb
is the light.

There the flowers bloom
forever and the day
Shall be one eternal day
without a night;
And our tears shall be forever
wiped away,
In that city where the Lamb
is the light.

Here we have our disappointments
all the while,
And our fondest hopes but meet
with bitter blight;
Though by night we weep, the
morning brings a smile,
In that city where the Lamb is the
light.

Then let sunshine fade, let twilight
bring its gloom,
Not a shadow can my blissful
soul affright;
For I know that up in heaven
there is room,
In that city where the Lamb is
the light."

1013;In The Beginning;;"CHORUS
In the beginning, before the beginning,
The great Elohim, had no origin,
He had no father, no mother, the great  Jehovah our God.

He had in His mind before the foundation,
That He, the Lamb would be slain
To redeem His creation;
He knew we had fallen from our
lofty heights to sin,
So He had to come in flesh and
die,
To bring us back again to Eden.

He came with a Shout revealing His redemption,
To call and claim His Bride
From the powers of deception;
So why should we doubt
That His words are in our mouths,
For He has ordained that we must prophesy again,
To every nation.

We have crossed back the chasm to our lofty heights,
By seven thundering voices, His great evening light;
We'll be translated to His heavenly domain,
We'll sit with Him as priests and kings;
We will reign with Him
Forever and ever and ever."

is so sweet,
The birds hush their singing,
And the melody
that He gave to me,
Within my heart is ringing.

around me be falling,

Through the voice of woe,
His voice to me is calling."

when each other's face we see,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

Oh the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in pow'r
And the songs of the blood-bought millions

Uttering his voice from Jerusalem

Like Daniel my comeliness  turned to corruption
Like Isaiah  I say I undone
And all that I can say

Where ever you go I will follow

1044;Is Thy Heart Right With God;;"Have thy affections
Been nailed to the cross?
Is thy heart right with God?
Countest thou all things
For Jesus but loss?
Is thy heart right with God?

CHORUS
Is thy heart right with God,
Washed in the crimson flood,
Cleansed and made holy,
Humble and lowly,
Right in the sight of God?

Hast thou dominion
O'er self and o'er sin
Is thy heart right with God?
Over all evil without and within?
Is thy heart right with God?

Is there no more
Condemnation for sin?
Is thy heart right with God?
Does Jesus rule
In the temple within?
Is thy heart right with God?

Are all thy pow'rs
Under Jesus' control?
Is thy heart right with God?
Does He each moment
Abide in thy soul?
Is thy heart right with God?

Art thou now walking
In heaven's pure light?
Is thy heart right with God?
Is thy soul wearing

Is thy heart right with God?"
1045;Is Your All On The Altar;;"You have longed for sweet peace,
And for faith to increase,
And have earnestly, fervently prayed:
But you cannot have rest,
Or be perfectly blest
Until all on the altar is laid.

CHORUS
Is your all on the altar
Of sacrifice laid?
Your heart,
Does the Spirit control?
You can only be blest
And have peace
And sweet rest,
As you yield Him
Your body and soul.

Would you walk with the Lord,
In the light of His Word,
And have peace and
Contentment alway?
You must do His sweet will,
To be free from all ill,
On the altar your all you must lay.

Oh, we never can know
What the Lord will bestow
Of the blessings for which
We have prayed,
Till our body and soul
He doth fully control,
And our all on the altar is laid.

Who can tell all the love
He will send from above,
And how happy our hearts
Will be made,
Of the fellowship sweet
We shall share at His feet,
When our all on the altar is laid?"

But out of these there shines a Bride,
The chosen ones,
The precious Seed of God,
She's the Rebecca for her Isaac;
And one of these days,
She will be changed,
She'll slip from time into eternity.

Verse 2
While people laugh at us and mock,
Our lives are being
Raptured up with Him,
We know He has received us;
And we'll come forth in His image;

Verse 2
The chosen ones,
The elected Seed of God,
The ones who love and serve Him;
And one of these days
We will be changed,
We'll slip from time into eternity.

He will return just as He said,
To take His Bride away to be with Him,
In His great Millennium;
His promise is true;
He has returned;

Verse 3

Or fails to keep His Word;
Just let us all be ready,
For one of these days
We'll all be changed,
We'll slip from time into eternity."

From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold.

From heaven's all gracious King!""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Verse 2
Still thro' the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats,
O'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains,
They bend on hovering wing;
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

Verse 3
And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low;
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow.
Look now! for glad and golden hours,
Come swiftly on the wing;
O rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing.

Verse 4
For lo, the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold;
When with the ever circling years,
Comes round the age of gold.
When peace shall over all the earth,
Its ancient splendors fling;
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing.

Verse 5
Yet with the woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long;
Beneath the angel strain have rolled,
Two thousand years of wrong.
And man, at war with man, hears not,
The love song which they bring;
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing."

Were God took  his servant and turned him around
He came back home to friends and family

Well, one by one they came till a church was born
It surely was the breaking of a new dawn

CHORUS
It has been God who passed our way
And it is God who is with us here today
And it is God still with us here today

we gathered on a street name Fran
With planks on bricks for benches and a pulpit made of pan
Till we move up to the house at Simpson Brown,
To give witness at the place where God took us from
Then amidst the voice of those who lived near
A building was erected and we worship God there

Well, the work was truly growing And the time came we move up
To unite with saints who were to be a part of this great work that
Well, mighty revelations thundered from that place
And around the world it went with shouting of grace

Our God is a Father he cares for old and young
And He has given this place for our little ones
As prisoners we stand right on this spot
We know its a transformation from what it was
Though tillers of the soil are all around
There still an Abel in our midst with a bloody Lamb

It seem we were set and just ready to go
But more of God's great plan began to unfold
The saints from deep in south
Has come to take their place amongst now
And as we wait, we wait right here
We are just waiting to be caught up, caught up in the air."

Something makes my life a blessing

Something calms my troubled breast;

Something draws my soul to heaven,
That sweet land of peace and rest.

The first wave-sheaf offering.

Given us faith and inward beauty,

And His Words are not in vain.

Keeps me saved and blest,
Floods with light

To His praise I will my
Ransomed pow'rs employ,
And renew my grateful vow.

Tho' Satan should buffet
Tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control;
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood
for my soul.

My sin - oh, the bliss
Of this glorious thought -
My sin - not in part,
But the whole
Is nailed to the cross,
And I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Oh my soul.

And Lord, haste the day
When my faith shall be sight.
The clouds be rolled back
as a scroll.
The trump shall resound,
And the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee,
For Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave,
is our goal;
Oh, the shout of the angel!
Oh, the voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope!
Blessed rest of my soul!

But the devil always fighting God
So there has to be a praying church
To fight with the two edge sword

It takes a sacrifice
To see God's word
A sacrifice
Spread throughout the world
A sacrifice
To see this message reach to the heart of men

In the days of the Ephesians church
In Paul's ministry when the church knelt down to pray for Paul
Those demons had to flee
Therefore in this age the bride age
So we ought to be
There has to be a church of God fulfilling her ministry
And though demons stands against us causing accidents and
How far are you willing to stoop for God to see his word fulfill

Many saints of the pass church ages sacrifice their lives
And although the messengers were killed
The message stayed alive
So God give us this full word

And prophesy and set the captive free
So the battle must keep raging
It gets bloody as can be
But as soldiers in God's army
We already have the victory"

And that you can't deny,
A God of might and miracles,

It took a miracle to put the stars in place,
It took a miracle to hang the world in space,
But when He saved my soul,
Cleansed and made me whole,
It took a miracle of love and grace.

Though here His glory has been shown;
We still can't fully see
The wonders of His might, His throne;
'Twill take eternity.

The Bible tells us of His power
And wisdom all way through;
And every little bird and flower
Are testimonies too."
1075;It Was A Great Thing;;"The Lord has brought me
Through all my trials, and when I failed Him
He didn't cast me away;
He stood right by me throughout my troubles,
And when I was lost He didn't let me go astray.

He took my sins, He saved my soul;
He filled me up and made me whole;
Jesus died on Calvary so the whole wide world could see
It was a great thing that He did for me.

CHORUS
It was a great thing that He did for me,
It was a great thing when He set me free;
Jesus died on Calvary so the whole wide world could see,
It was a great thing that He did for me.

He's been my doctor,
He's been my lawyer,
He's never left me, He's been my friend;
He's been my comforter when I was lonely,
And when I was lost Jesus took me in.

He took my sins, He saved my soul;
He filled me up and made me whole;
Jesus died on Calvary so the whole wide world could see,
It was a great thing that He did for me."

He was bruised for our transgressions
And by His stripes we are healed;
Only believe and receive your healing
In the name of Jesus Christ,

Joy and peace without money, without price,

Though the devil keeps fighting
to keep us blind,
Glory to God, it was revealed,
Yes, it was done on Calvary.

Verse 4

I mean the grace of God,
That was revealed to us on Calvary?
On that day on Calvary we were redeemed;

Now, let the weak say I am strong,
let the poor say I am rich,
For the devil was defeated
And death was conquered,
Glory, glory, glory to His name
It was done on Calvary.

Verse 5
It was done on Calvary,
We are the beneficiaries of Calvary.
In the power of resurrection
we stand undefeated,
The blood of Lord Jesus
will never lose its power.

Verse 6
Unconquerable!

And I, me, myself we

1077;It Was His Love For Me;;"It was His love for me
That nailed Him to the tree
To die in agony for all my sin.
For my own guilt and shame
The Great Redeemer came;
Willing to bear the pain of all my sin.
Oh, what a Saviour is mine!
In Him God's Mercies combine
His love can never decline
and He loves me."
1078;It Was Years Ago;;"It was years ago since I first heard it told
How He's coming back to take His children home,
No it won't be long, we'll be going home,
I want to go.

There'll be mansions there far beyond compare,
They talk of streets of gold
Where we'll never grow old,
No it won't be long,
We'll be going home,
I want to go.

CHORUS
I want to go where the storms clouds never rise,
I want to go where the flowers
never die;
Don't you want to go where we'll never say goodbye
There'll be no loneliness,
No more tears to dim the eye.

The crystal river flows,
From the great white throne;
Saints would laugh and sing,
Joyful  praises ring,
No it won't be long, we'll be going home,
I want to go.

CHORUS

I want to be there when the final roll is called,
I want to see the saints of old who've join the ransomed throng,
Don't you want to go where we'll never say goodbye,
There'll be no loneliness, no more tears to dim the eyes.

There'll be mansions there far beyond compare,
They talk of streets of gold
Where we'll never grow old;
We'll see him on His throne, He'll say welcome home,
I want to go."
1079;It Will Be Too Late;;"The leaves are falling,
harvest time is past
So is it in the spirit,
the end is coming past
The time will soon be here
when Jesus Christ will come
Oh lift up you heads
your redemption is drawing nigh

Chorus
And it will be too late
my brother then to pray
Don
what you can do today
Or you will find yourself in judgement
and you
For the opportunity
that has come your way

Now it
and the reapers are in the field
To find the last of the seed,
the other will not yield
And the Glory of God will shine,
for it
And the true Bride of Christ
will soon fall into line"
1080;It Will Be Worth It All;;"It will be worth it all
When we see Jesus,
Life's trials will seem so small,
When we see Christ.
One glimpse of His dear face
All sorrow will erase,
So bravely run the race,
Till we see Christ."
1081;It Will Either Be In Your Heart;;"Had His trial in Pilate
All the unbelievers came
Pilate said,
They screamed,
Placed on Him a purple robe
and crucified this Man
And released to us Barabbas
and let His blood be on their hands

Chorus
It
or on your hands
Once you meet the Saviour,
you
You can turn and walk away or
you can choose this Man
It
or be on you hands

Jesus said He would return
and things would be the same
That those who don
would turn Him down again
So He sent an indictment for
crucifying Him again
They chose the denominations
no it
Words to a song come easy
when your life is a song"

1084;It'll Take The Rapture;;"The streams are all polluted
And the fishes all gonna die from the acid rain
Factories they poison the air
Pretty soon there won't be air to breathe that's clean
They say that radiation destroy civilization
How can we escape without the rapture
What's gonna come and set us free
And save us from this terrible disaster

CHORUS
It'll take the rapture
It'll take the rapture
What's gonna take us to that land
Where we can lay down in green pastures
It'll take the rapture
It'll take the rapture
Take my family to live in peace
Where we can be happy ever after
It'll take the rapture

Men's hearts are failing for fear
As they see the things happening across the land
So much pressure on the sons of God
How much more of Satan's Eden can they stand
Teenage suicides on the rampage
This dreaded disease called AIDS
And no future has taken away their laughter
If they will hear will you tell them how
They can escape this terrible disaster"
1085;It's A Glorious Church;;"It's a Glorious Church,
Without spot or wrinkle;
Washed in the Blood of the Lamb.
It's a Glorious Church,
Without spot or wrinkle;
Washed in the Blood of the Lamb.

It's a Glorious Church,
And I am a member;
Washed in the Blood of the Lamb.

And I am a member;
Washed in the Blood of the Lamb."
1086;It's A Good Thing To Give;;"CHORUS
It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord
And to sing praises unto your name O most High
You show forth your loving kindness in
the morning and thy faithfulness every night
It is a good thing to give thanks
O Lord you are great, your name shall we praise
O lord Most High

From the rising of the sun
Unto the going down of the same
With hearts of thanksgiving Lord
We praise your Holy name
And there is no other
That deserves all glory
And there is no other
That we could rely on
And place our trust

You've been our guiding light
On our journey
You're the pillar of Fire
Leading us to eternity
And when the storms are raging
You are our shelter
A strong and mighty tower
That the righteous can run into
In you we are save."
1087;It's A Name Above All Names;;"It's a name above all names,
And we will declare it,
We will declare it,
It's a name above all names,

""Who will declare My name?
Who will shout My name
In the middle of the nations,
Who will take the shield of faith,
And the sword of My mouth
And declare My name to a dying world?""

""He who hath declared Me thus far
Will walk in even greater power,
For the sands of time are running out,
Yet My name will be declared in this final hour.""

""I am Jehovah, I Am that I Am!
And My trumpet shall soon sound  out.
I formed the world with just a  whisper,
But this generation, this generation,
This generation heard Me shout."""

1090;It's An Honor;;"It's an honour to serve to join in the fight
I will lift up my voice
I will lay down my life
Giving glory to God, seeking none in return
It's an honour, an honour to serve

We are called by the Name
Of The Third Exodus
We will not be ashamed
For our God is with us
We obey our calling,
Stand in rank and in file
It's an honour, an honour to serve

Of One Body, One Spirit
One Lord and One Faith
Of hearts joined in praise
And One love, unfeigned
Working together for this great cause
It's an honour, an honour to serve

There's a Pastor, and Ministers
And helpers true
Deacons and Trustees
And Song Leaders too
Fitted into the Body
Making its increase
It's an honour, our calling to serve

Our Chefs, their Assistants
And our servers too
Ushers, and Teachers of our Sunday school
Librarians, Custodians, our Maintenance Crew

The Singers, songwriters, sound engineers, anointed musicians
Decorators so talented in all that they do
It's an honour, an honour to serve."
1091;It's Dripping With Blood;;"The first one to die for
This Holy Ghost plan,
Was John the Baptist,
But he died like a man;
Then came the Lord Jesus,
They crucified Him,
He taught that the Spirit
Would save men from sin.

CHORUS
It's dripping with blood, Yes,
It's dripping with blood,
This Holy Ghost Gospel
Is dripping with blood,
The blood of disciples
Who died for the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel
Is dripping with blood.

There was Peter and Paul,
And John the divine,
They gave up their lives so
This Gospel could shine;
They mingled their blood,
Like the prophets of old,
So the true Word of God
Could honestly be told.

Then they stoned Stephen,
He preached against sin,
He made them so angry,
They dashed his head in;
But he died in the Spirit,
And gave up the ghost,
And went to join others,
In that life-giving host.

There's souls under the altar,
Crying, ""How long?""
For the Lord to punish
Those who've done wrong;
But there's going to be more
Who'll give their life's blood
For this Holy Ghost Gospel
And its crimson flood."
1092;It's Jesus I Really Want To See;;"verse 1
I've truly known the good life
Filled with family and friends;
I've been blest with
more than my share;

verse 1
But in the heart of my heart,
I know there's more for me;
So much more than
this fading world I'm in.

Chorus
It's Jesus I really want to see (x2)
The more I see of this world,
The less it means to me,
And it's Jesus I really want to see.

verse 2
I've been a lot of places
And I've known
the great and small;
I've seen the grand and
noble works of men;

verse 2
And yet with all of my good fortune,
My heart is seeking still;
Oh I just can't deny the longing there."
1093;It's Jubilee Time Again;;"It's Jubilee time again,
The outpouring of the Latter rain,
When you hear the Trumpet,
Shout and worship Him.

Keep on rejoicing, rejoicing,
It's Jubilee time again,
Rejoicing, rejoicing,
The anointing breaks every chain.

Keep on rejoicing, rejoicing.
You are pardoned from your sin,
Rejoicing, rejoicing,
The anointing breaks every chain."
1094;It's Me, It's Me;;"Chorus
It's me, it's me, It's me oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer

Standing in the need of prayer

Not my Pastor, Not my Deacon
But it's me oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Not my Pastor, Not my Deacon
But it's me oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer

Not my brother, Not my sister
But it's me oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Not my brother, Not my sister
But it's me oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer

Not my father, Not my mother

Standing in the need of prayer
Not my father, Not my mother
But it's me oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer"
1095;It's My Desire;;"It's my desire to be like Jesus
It's my desire to be like Him
Though often I have failed Him
And brought him much shame
It's my desire to live for Him.

It's my desire to help someone
today
Someone who may have failed
to see the way
I too was once so lost but I found
my way to God
It's my desire to live for Him.

If you could see where Jesus
brought me from
To where I am today, you would
know the reason
Why I love Him so
Now you can take this world's
wealth and riches
I don't need these things
It's my desire to live for Him.

"
1096;It's Not In Trying But;;"Verse 1
Sometimes life seems like words and music
That can't become a song
And we cry and sigh and we try again and wonder
What could be wrong;

Verse 1
And when we turn to the Lord
At the end of ourselves like we've done at times or before
We'll find hid truth is the same as it always been
We never will need more

CHORUS
It's not in trying but in trusting
It's not in running but in resting
It's not in wondering but in praying
That we find the strength of the Lord.

Verse 2
He's all we need for our every needs
He'll never leave thee alone
But the last move that we choose
To do to live a life on our own;

Verse 2
But the only good that could ever be said
Are the pain we find ourselves in
Yet there are places to gain the wisdom
To say I'll never leave him again"

This Holy Ghost power;
It's setting me free, this very hour;

This Holy Ghost power."
1099;It's So Wonderful To Know;;"It
there is a place where you can go
When you

When it seems there
that
Pray to God up in Heaven
and tell Him how you feel

Chorus
Yes it
that He is real
Living in my soul His love I can feel
with each step that I take,
I know I
And all my trials will be over
after a while."
1100;It's The Annointing;;"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
For He hath anointed me
To bring good tidings to the meek;
To bind the broken-hearted,
To proclaim liberty to the captives,
And the opening of the prisons to them that are bound.

CHORUS
It's the anointing that makes the difference,
Once you've known It
You'll never be the same;
You can't live without It
Once it rests upon you;
It will teach you how to walk in Jesus' name.

In My name, you will cast out demons;
In M
You shall lay your hand upon the sick,
And they will recover;
All these signs shall follow you in My name"
1101;It's The Life;;"Verse 1
It's the life behind the Name,
That makes the demons tremble.
It's the life behind the Name,
That makes the proud heart humble;

Verse 1
It was God who devised a plan,
That in all things as a man,
He would live, so He could give
To us the life behind the Name.

Bridge
Jesus is the Life X2
Sin and death must go they are conquered
For Jesus is alive."
1102;It's The Spirit;;"If words could describe just how I feel inside
I'd write a psalm concerning my dear Lord
But words could be beyond compare
To any other verse
They glorify the one that I adore
But words can not explain
Just why He bore my shame
No phrase could quite convey the love He showed
My psalm could never fill the hearts of a hundred thirsty  souls
But the Spirit in God's Word can make them whole

Chorus
It's the Spirit
The Holy Spirit
It's the Spirit in God's Word that makes them whole
It's the Spirit
The Holy Spirit
Why don't you let God's Spirit
Fill your soul

If love could project something within His Bride
The reason for all fears would all subside
If she could take that robe of white
Dressed in all His Grace
The love of Christ would shine upon her face
But her love could not be known if Christ is never shown
In the life in which the love in her has grown
Her love could never win the hearts of the lost
and lonely souls
But the Spirit in His Word can make them whole"

Living in a world of insanity
We're surrounded by the dead,
They are all asleep
But under the Easter seal,
Thank God
We're quickened and awakened;

Now the Master is here,
The Son has risen
He's no longer
the hidden Messiah,
But He has appeared
Now to the promise of a second coming,
I'm looking ahead.

They're wounded in the battle,
Lord they are dying;
Brothers take each other's hand
Sisters do the same thing too;

Lift each other in prayer,
We will make it through,
And though skin worms may destroy this body
I've got another one waiting for me;

Verse 2
So Lord fill my soul with your Holy Ghost,
Cleanse me
and make me whole.

1113;Jehovah Is Here To Lead Us;;"There we were in Egypt, under Pharaoh
We were bound by a wrong religion, caught in the creed of man.
Then a prophet from the desert, starts preaching all around.
God has heard our prayer, Jehovah has come down.

Moses sure was no good speaker.  Nothing polished I could tell.
But we all began to notice that he knew Jehovah well.
As he stood behind the pulpit, showing signs of God's great power,
It's Jehovah here, the Message of the hour.

On the journey through the desert, 'bout thirty miles high,
Was a Cloud that led us everyday, and at night, a Pillar of Fire.
If you ask for my opinion, all that I can say,
Is Jehovah's here to lead us all the way.

I know Jehovah's here to lead us all the way.
A Pillar of Fire by night, and a Cloud by day.
I know Jehovah's here to lead us all the way.
And I will follow everything He has to say.

I will never part.  I will always stay.
This Word inside my heart, will lead me all the way."

He shall go before us
Set fire to the camps of our enemies
Jehovah Nissi, God our banner
Will cleanse this world from iniquity
The Lord shall roar from Zion
That heavenly Jerusalem
And though the heavens and earth will shake
The Lord will be his people's hope and strength

Men have built their empires on scientific exploits
Towers of organizations will reap the fruits of their vain toils.
But men of war let's draw near, united under one headship,
We've seen the vision and we're committed
Let's possess the gates of the enemy without fear.

False anointed one in the end time, appear to be all clothed in
Try to paint a picture of perfection to deceive the true vine,
But we as the army of the living God,
We see through eyes of the eagles, we'll fight the good fight and
If God be for us then tell me who can be against us.

Was down there in the rubble, buried in all my trouble

Then with one foot on land and the other one on the sea
You came with shoutings of grace and revealed my true

CHORUS
So here I am Lord on my knees
Asking for strength just one touch from thee
I cannot sing your songs down there in Babylon
So I'm gonna fight with sword in hand
The Lord God of hosts is in command

till all my breeches are mended }X2

Bride of Christ, I know sometimes you lose your battle cry
But now in this cycle, watch all your mountains crumble
Mix the anointed word with faith, apply the blood it's the only
Our gates must be fortified as we feast on bread and wine
No more room for sin, resisting power flows from within
And we'll go marching with shoutings of victory as we head to

Bridge1
Lord, so many times we see Jerusalem
broken, dismayed and distressed
But we stand here today laying our all on the altar,
burying our unbelief, burying our fears, burying our dreams.
Restore unto us the joy of our salvation that when you return to
you shall find a bride risen out of the ashes, spotless,
marching onward Christian soldiers.

Bridge2
A risen Jerusalem, claiming our healing,
claiming our deliverance, claiming your peace,
no more captivity, no more mind battles, no more shackles.
This is your revival, this is our revival.
A risen Jerusalem

Let's lift up the hands of the weak
Satan's still plotting his evil schemes
But be thou strong and work for I am with you
I'm still with you St. Vincent and St. Lucia
Tobago, St. Kitts, Grenada, Dominica

Not forgetting Trinidad and Guyana, we're all part of Mount
We've seen the risen son,
With blessed assurance this race we'll run
God is determined to take us higher
Kick that mamba down in the fire."

For us to understand,

The stature of a perfect man.

CHORUS
Jesus in me, Jesus in me,
Seven thunders within this life of mine,
From Paul to William Branham,
From Faith to Perfect love,
These lively stones are reaching
out to God.

There is no one like my Jesus,
No person can compare,
He satisfies me fully,
There's no reason for despair;
And when battles in this life
Get me down all so low,
He fills my lamp with living oil
When in prayer to Him I go.

His grace is all sufficient
For this failing flesh of mine,
Every answer to the Bible,
It has been there all the time;
And even though I fail Him daily,
Perfection dwells within,
Those seven thundering voices
Will bring Jesus back again.

The foundation of the pyramid
Is Faith preached by Paul,
Irenaeus fought for Virtue,
That pyramid grew tall.
Do you see where we are standing?
Just one more step and then
Those seven thundering voices
Will bring Jesus back again."

Spend my life seeking wealth,

I could desire to rule the nations
But what would it profit me?

Dashing through the snow,

Laughing all the way,
Bells on bobtail ring,
Making spirits bright.

A sleighing song tonight.

Arise and shine thy Lord and King
Comes full redemption now to bring.

Have you considered my little Bride?
Oft to deceive her you have tried.
No fairer one from east to west,
Ordained to stand the great  word test.

Joel's army comes in view,
Stalwart men and women true;
In perfect steps they are God's best,
Invincible through the great Word test.

The Son of righteousness shall shine,
With healing in His wings He'll rise,
Shake this old world with one more ride;
Then take His Bride into the skies.

The Lion of Judah has prevailed,
Almighty God in flesh was veiled.
He comes forth now to conquer all.
The kingdoms of this world shall fall.

Oh, Bridegroom come, our hearts
do pine,
Upon Thy bosom to recline.
My lovely Bride you are My own,
Come sit with Me upon My throne."

Upon the isle of Patmos
A man was cast one day,
As he was left alone
To die;

He began to pray,
The Holy Ghost fell on him,
And he began to write
About the things that he saw,
The revelator's name was John.

Chorus
John the revelator,
He saw Jerusalem coming down,
John the revelator,
When he looked around
He saw feet like brass,
Eyes are like fire,

Chorus
Heard a great voice,
Say come up high
John the revelator,
Wrote about the city of God.

Verse 2
While in the Spirit praying,
John turned around to see
The voice he had heard
Was what it seemd to be;

Verse 2
Just like a many waters,
The great trumpet sound,
When He said I am
The first and the last,
The revelator wrote it down.

My tongue would bless Thy name;
By Thee the joyful news,
Of our salvation came;
The joyful news of sins forgiven,
Of hell subdued and peace with heaven.

Verse 3
Jesus, my great High Priest,
Offered His blood and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside;
His powerful blood did once atone,
And now it pleads before the throne.

Verse 4
My Savior and my Lord,
My Conqueror and my King;
Thy scepter and Thy sword,
Thy reigning grace I sing;
Thine is the power behold I sit,
In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.

Verse 5
Now let my soul arise
And tread the tempter down;
My Captain leads me forth,
To conquest and a crown;
A feeble saint shall win the day,
Though death and hell obstruct the way.

Verse 6
Should all the hosts of death
And powers of hell unknown
Put their most dreadful forms
Of rage and malice on,
I shall be safe for Christ displays,
Superior power and guardian grace."

And God remembered Abraham
And said, ""I shall return according to the time of life,
And Sarah shall have a visitation;""
And after she judged Him faithful,
He proved that He could be trusted,
She received strength to conceive seed.

You said in your Father's house are many mansions,
If it was not so You would have told me;
So You've gone to prepare a place for me,
That where You are, there I'm also going to be.

CHORUS
So I'm judging You faithful! }2x
Faithful who promised.
When You left these shores two thousand years ago,
(taken up in a cloud),
There stood two angels saying, ""Men and brethren
why stand ye here gazing?
For this same Jesus which is taken up from you
Shall so return in like manner,""
And I know that's true.

You said whatsoever I stand
praying,
Go away believing;
For what-so-ever you ask the Father in My Name
He will give it to you, for my God is forever the same.

BRIDGE

You said no gates will ever stand before me,
And that old devil will be powerless before me,
For in Your Name sin will have no dominion over me,
And I believe, yes, I believe
That's the way, yes, that's the way it's going to be."

Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Thru this world of toil and snares,
If I falter,
Lord, who cares?
Who with me
my burden share?
None but Thee, dear Lord,

Guide me gently, safely o'er,
To Thy kingdom shore,

As we sweep through those pearly gates.

And the new day it will begin
Soon we'll hear our Father calling
""Come my children enter in"";

Singing out the victory song
All our troubles then will be ended
And we'll live in heaven above.

Verse 3
Soon we'll meet again our loved ones
And we'll take them by the hand
Soon we'll press them to our bosom
Over in the promised land;

And we'll be at home forever."

time to look around me

in the air.

Chorus
Just anyday now our Lord
is coming
He'll be returning for you and me
Oh I've been watching and
I've been waiting
Just anyday His face I'll see.

There has this longing in my
heart of His appearing

trial here below.

long and I'm so weary
But somehow I feel I'm so
much closer home."

To Thee whose blood can cleanse

Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

Because Thy promise I believe,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!"

With his eyes plucked out
Here stands the man with all of his stature
But with no power in his life

Verse1
Raised up by God and given power
To put to flight the armies of the enemy
But gave away all of his secrets
Was now bound and in captivity

Verse1
In the book of his remembrance
Were all the great victories he had won
Realizing his present condition From
deep down inside this cry began

CHORUS
Just once more Lord
Just once more Lord
So we can see your power
moving once again
Just once more Lord

Verse2
Repenting of all mistakes and failures
Praying in his heart Lord let me die
Not considering what it would cost him
Should God hear and
would answer his sincere cry

Verse2
For he could feel his locks had grown out
Thinking is there a possibility of the
power of God coming back
Began to cry more earnestly

Verse3
Inaugurated at Pentecost
Signs and wonders, manifestations of His name
But there at the council of Nicea
The early church had its locks shaved
With a promise of restoration

Verse3
We have seen God's church
rise in power through each stage
Until God sent to us a prophet
And we have seen the
fullness of God's life on display

Verse3
But its been so long
since the eyes have gone out
And there is a new crop that is coming forth
For greater works and
dynamic power to be displayed
May we as Samsons of God cry just once more"

Chorus
Just to be blessing, i go on a journey
Climb up the highest mountain
And cross the deep-blue sea
I leave home and family
I go where the spirit leads me
I'm giving my life away
Just to be a blessing

I never cared for preaching theology
To share God's love, it's good
Enough for me
When sinners find their way
to perfect liberty
i give God Glory
For he is just using me

I was sitting alone and wondering
About what I'm supposed to do,
I can't deny the times I've made mistakes,
I can't hide from Him, He knew

Verse 1
But I knew that deep within my soul
I felt sorry honest I do,
So I just cried and said, ""Forgive me Lord,
Forgive me again, will you.""

Chorus
Justified, justified You have not done it in the first place
you're justified
Justified, justified You have not done it in the first place
you're justified

Verse 2
So often I'm discouraged
When I count the times I fall
'Cause He promised I'd be victorious
When I knew I'm not at all

Verse 2
Then I heard an eagle scream,
Its voice quickened my soul
He said ""You've not done it in the first
place, you're justified.""

Verse 3
He Looked at a perfect picture
Without blame, spot or wrinkle
He didn't look at you where you are now,
He looked back from Eternity

Verse 3
He said you're just trapped in that body
You bypassed your Theophany:
You have not done it in the first place,
you're justified"

Keep walking with the Lord
Keep trusting in His Word
And do not set your hearts
On man-made creeds

When evil doth betide

On Eagle Wings!

The Scriptures tell the Story
Of Enoch long ago
Who walked with God and was not
Yet no-one seemed to know
That he had been translated
For death he did not see
And walked off with our Saviour
Into Eternity.

One day God's servant Moses
Obeying God's command
Went up the distant summit
To view the Promised Land
The people in the valley
Beheld his face no more
For he had gone forever
To Heaven's Eternal Shore

When God did take Elijah
From troubles here below
Up to his Home in Glory
Eternal rest to know
He sent the weary prophet
A Chariot of Flame
And lifted him to Heaven
Oh, Glory to His Name!

When God did send His Prophet
Br' Branham here below
To start a Great Revival
All o'er the earth to go
And then the Seventh Angel
His message did proclaim
To take us into Glory
Let's Magnify His Name!"

Out where the full tides flow.

And gaze on the ocean so wide;
They never have ventured its
depths to explore,
Or to launch on the fathomless tide.

And others just venture away
from the land,
And linger so near to the shore,
That the surf and the slime
that beat over the strand,
Dash o'er them in floods evermore.


Oh,let us launch out on this
ocean so broad,
Where the floods of salvation e'er flow;
Oh, let us be lost in the mercy of God,
Till the depths of His fullness we know."

He helps me with each task if only I'll ask;
Ev'ry day now I'm learning to lean.

There's a Message coming forth,
Father, I pray, You'll let the Dove lead;
As we listen now to the message of the Lord
Father, I pray, Your way we'll follow.

Here I stand in need of You this day and this hour,
How can I, how can I go on Lord if You don't go before?
Here I am in this wilderness on my own,
I'm depending on Your Message Lord, alone to take me home.

As the prophet stood that day being out on his own,
Realizing that  he could not find his way alone,
He had to give up even though he tried
To get out of the wilderness, he depended on the Guide.

Lead us on Lord, as we go through this trail;
To reveal Your Word Lord, You have not failed;
All those Messages You brought all along:
'The Real Gift Of God,'
'Burnt Offering,'
'On The Wings Of A Snow White Dove,'
Revealed 'Supernova,'
Told us 'Consecrate,'
'Baptism Of Fire On The Eighth Day,'
'The Seals and Trumpets,'
'Capstone Message Of Grace'
And The 'Inside Life With Christ,'
'Being Borne Away On Eagle's wings,'
'Restoration Revealed In The Four Stages,'

'Still Tied To My Absolute,'
'My Compass and My North Star,'

'Be Not Afraid, Only Believe.'"

Would you have the Spirit
in your heart to cheer?
Would you be relieved from
ev'ry doubt and fear?
Make the consecration,
Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

Do you want the fire of God
to fill your soul,
Burn up all the dross,
and sanctify the whole?
Make the consecration,
Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in.

Do you want the pow'r
to make you true and brave,
So that you can rescue
those that Christ would save?
Make the consecration,
Trust in God, and then,
Let the Holy Ghost come in."
1324;Let The Lord Have His Way;;"Let the Lord have His way,

Some poor fainting, struggling sea-man
You may rescue, you may save.

Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;
Some poor sailor tempest tossed,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost."

Till I can take no more;
Filling me up, let me overflow

You've got to be planted in the Word to die;
Your body might decay here in the earth,
But it will spring to life with

We know  that the life  which is in us will spring again,

True spiritual relationship,
That we might walk together
In the love of the Lord.
Not just ""How do you do?""
But ""I really love you so.""
That all men will know we are
The disciples of Christ.

We confess our need of healing,
Lord, so often we've been dealing
With our strife and many problems
In our own way;
So we're in a broken up state,
Got to find a  way to prostrate,
Help us oh Lord.

For we love each other,
Don't we?
And we need each other,

Let us draw near with a true heart
In full assurance of faith;
That we find grace and
In time of need.

It took a perfect sacrifice before
We could ever attain to
That's why Christ the perfect Lamb,
The atonement came,
And to the Holiest of Holies,
He cleared the way.


So let us draw near having our hearts
Sprinkled by His blood,
For now we have free access
To the throne of God.

And we daily make mistakes for we are weak,
But we have not a High Priest
With the feelings of our infirmities."

Kept looking unto You in prayer

Because You were there

Let us soar past our unbelief inside
Let us fly past the barriers of sin
And teach us Lord to wait on You
Because all we want to do
Is please You Lord

Beyond human reason,  this place You have chosen,
Another wilderness You have transformed.
With Your prisoners of love,
And Your anointing from above;
Another paradox You have performed.

Your beauty and character we have seen in each other,
As we worked together in one accord.
We've seen Your power on display,
You've answered when we prayed,
Through hard trials You made a way.

Let every lively stone  in this building,
Shout the praise of God (Praise the Lord,)

To welcome in the Lord,

And support the house of God.

a manger of my heart
Let it live in me let it start
Live inside this house of clay
And mold it everyday
Let your word be borne in a

Unlikely a place for His
word to unfold
But if I just yield this vessel
And let Him have His way
From glory unto glory
He'll change me day be day."

Your gates have been trodden down
And your temple in ruins

To strengthen your hands to rebuild
So with one tool in hand, the other with the sword
Let's build back Jerusalem

Just be strong and take courage
Lo I'm YOUR God who's with you
This work you're ordained to fulfill

Or on the mountain top

Hallelujah all praise to our Saviour
Let's give Him honour and glory and praise

He is our King
And we are His people
And we all know
That He inhabits praise
So from the rising of the sun
To the going down of the same
We will honour and worship His name

There is a land
Not very far from here
Where our brothers and sisters have gone
We're just waiting for that morning
When we'll all get together
Just to magnify and praise our Lord"

Let's pray for a Holy Ghost arrival

Sometimes we just gone thru the motion,
Left the Spirit out,
No power in our program,
No victory in our shout;
But God will give us back the joy
Let's open up the Bible, lay aside formality,
Let's have a revival.

Well I ask a old time preacher

On every step, I need Your Light indeed
Oh Light of God just shine on my way

It's just a few days of living right
I've wasted precious years
When I was healthy
In darkness, and I couldn't see
I couldn't help 'cause I was blind
Salvation light I could never know

My body's bruised and I'm left to die
Oh I was stripped,
A sinner I used to be
Without the Light
I was a wanderer,
There was no one to show me the Light,
And I was blind more than I can tell.

Oh little time be my labour days,
So faithful until I wear a crown,
I'm going to wear my immortality,
I'm going to shine in a body glorified,
I'm going to shine in the golden land."

Wounded by the master of deceit

Shining with compassion in Your

Let Your lights shine thru me in the

1359;Live In Your Inheritance;;"verse 1
From a life of sin and bondage
Taskmasters held me bound
I've been living underprivileged
Constructing Satan's Eden

verse 1
Then an angel from God came to me with the Word
The mystery of who I really am
Saying you came from God
You go back to God
Come and live in your inheritance.

CHORUS
Every place that your feet tread upon
That I give to thee
If you say to that mountain be moved
Thus thine eyes shall see

chorus
Because you came from God, you go back to God
Come and live in your inheritance.

verse 2
Divine Natured Attributes of God
Who journeyed into Canaan's land
Placed positionally in Christ the Lord
Victory is in our hands

verse2
And with all things under our feet
Every enemy we meet will know
That we're the heirs of God

Bridge
Every enemy we meet
Put them under your feet
Death get under my feet
Unbelief, under my feet
Doubt, you're under my feet
Hate, you're under my feet
Fear, you're under my feet;

bridge
To every enemy you meet
Put them under your feet!
Fear, Get under my feet!
Unbelief, under my feet
Fear, Get under my feet;
Devil Get under my feet!

chorus
Because we came from God
We go back to God
Come and live in your inheritance"
1360;Live Right;;"Blessed is the man
whom the Lord will find
(Doing His perfect will, all the time.)
Though mortal strength faileth,
He's not (weary yet),
His labours of love, the Lord  will never forget.

CHORUS
We will live right, everyday,
'Cause Jesus can come now
just any day.

Blessed are your eyes, for the things that they see,
(Many prophets of old have inquired diligently;)
For no more darkly do we see but (face to face).
(Lift your hands and praise the Lord for amazing grace.)

Blessed are your ears, for the things that they hear;
(Many uncertain sounds are everywhere)
For the gospel trumpet sounded sweet (jubilee).
(Lift your hands and praise the Lord Who has set you free.)

Gird up your loins, ye mighty  men of war;
(Full obedience to God's Word and victory is sure;)
For perfect faith is strong and knows (no defeat.)
(For the god of this world must wriggle under our feet).

Punish with vengeance all iniquity,
(By confessing your faults with sincerity.)
You must say (""Satan you have no place in me!
Let the Royal Vesture be now put on me."")"

1362;Living By Faith;;"I care not today
What the morrow may bring,
If shadow or sunshine or rain,
The Lord I know ruleth
o'er everything,
And all of my worry is vain.

CHORUS
Living by faith, in Jesus above,
Trusting, confiding in
His great love;
From all harm safe
In His sheltering arm.
I'm living by faith
{And I feel no alarm} X2.

Though tempest may blow
And the stormclouds arise,
Obscuring the brightness of life,
I'm never alarmed
At the overcast skies,
The Master looks on at the strife.

I know that He safely
will carry me through,
No matter what evils betide,
Why should I then care,
Though the tempest may blow,
If Jesus walks close to my side.

Our Lord will return to this
earth some  sweet day,
Our troubles will then all be o'er.
The Master so gently
Will lead us away,
Beyond that blest heavenly shore."
1363;Living Epistles;;"We are eyewitnesses of His majesty,
We have seen the Lord fulfilling His Word;
And we know we are God's characters in this great symphony,
As we act on the things
That we have seen and we have heard.

CHORUS
How else can we live, forever praising Him,
For we are living epistles read of all men;
You are Almighty God in flesh again,
That's who we are,
Living epistles read of all men,
You are to me,
Almighty God in flesh again.

We've been made a spectacle to this world today,
The Life of Jesus being on display;
Our resurrected Christ.
Awaken Jesus to the scene again,
As He glorifies His Name once again in His children.

Let's press on daily with the King's Sword in our hand,
Defeating the enemy on every hand;
So ride on Thy Majesty to Thy rightful place
On the throne of our hearts;
Of this kingdom, He rose us up to be a part.

We know that today the Word is in the Bride
It's Jesus again on His second ride;
Let's bring our King, our rejected King,
A clean fresh drink,
By living worthy of this gospel         We worship Him."
1364;Living For Jesus;;"Chorus 1
O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
I give myself to Thee.
For Thou in Thy atonement,
Didst give Thyself for me.
I own no other master,
My heart shall be Thy throne.
My life I give henceforth to live,
O Christ for Thee alone.

Verse 1
Living for Jesus, a life that is true.
Striving to please Him in all that I do.
Yielding allegiance glad hearted and free.
This is the pathway of blessing for me.

Verse 2
Living for Jesus who died in my place,
Bearing on Calvary, my sin and disgrace.
Such love constrains me, to answer His call,
Follow His leading and give Him my all.

Verse 3
Living for Jesus, wherever I am.
Doing each duty in His holy name.
Willing to suffer affliction or loss.
Deeming each trial, a part of my cross.

Verse 4
Living for Jesus, through earth's little while,
My dearest treasure, the light of His smile.
Seeking the lost ones, He died to redeem.
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him."
1365;Living Reality;;"God gave a promise
To his bride in this last days
Priest and Kings He's made us
And forever we shall reign
We following an eternal order
Way beyond the humanistic realm
God lifting us to higher place
Only by his grace

CHORUS
We're living reality
We are His Holy Word
The Substance of the shadow
The fulfillment of His Word
We're living reality
We're the mystery revealed
Christ manifested in us
He in us and we in Him

Our natural birth brouht five senses
To relate to natural things
But by our new birth
We receive the sixth sense faith
Faith is the Holy Spirit
Came in us to dwell again
A circumcised people
Greater works we'll do again

Faith relates to Melchizedec
And we are the faith
Faith is the substance
God in flesh again
We are not on Mt Sinai
But now up to Mt Zion
Like our father Abraham
From the dust to the stars
We were made"
1366;Living Waters;;"Let your living waters
Flow over my soul
Let your Holy Spirit come

Give your life to Jesus,
Let Him lift Your soul
Let Him take You in His arms
And make You whole
As you give Your life to Him
He will set You free
You will live and reign with Him
Eternally"
1367;Living Where The Healing Waters Flow;;"I've cast my heavy burdens down
on Canaan's happy shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
I'll wander in the wilderness of
doubt and sin no more;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

Chorus
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore,
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

With Israel's trusting children
I'm rejoicing on my way,
I'm living where the healing waters flow;
The cloudy, fiery pillar
is my guiding light today.
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

My hung'ring soul is satisfied
with manna from above,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
No more I thirst, the rock I've found,
that fount of endless love;
I'm living where the healing waters flow.

I'm singing ""Hallelujah,""
safely anchored in my soul,
I'm living where the healing waters flow,
I'm resting on his promises;
the blood has made me whole.
I'm living where the healing waters flow."
1368;Lo In Her Mouth;;"We can see the signs of the times are all around,
Unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the Dragon's mouth,
False prophets are lying and the truth they are denying;
But we have received our message of grace,
On the wings of a Snow-White dove.

CHORUS
Lo! in her mouth
Is an olive leaf,
That speaks about redemption,
That speaks about His grace.
Lo! in her mouth
Is an olive leaf;
It speaks about eternal life
And fellowship with God.

Economic and social pressures are everywhere,
Many have been caught unawares;
The hour of temptation has come upon everyone,
But unto us His little Bride,
His voice whispers 'Shalom!'

He said, ""Fear not my child, all your troubles are over,
And I will do all unto
Thee all that thou requires
Fear none of these things that
Shall tear this world apart,
For the Dove is cooing in our hearts
Who are shut up in the ark."
1369;Long We Long;;"Into Your court we come,
Deep in our hearts we long to be
Near to the throne of Your glory;
As we draw near to You,
Know that we're here to do Your will,
God, how we long to be near to You.

May our prayers be like incense
Raising up to Your throne,
May our songs be a fragrance unto You,
May our lives be a pleasing offering in all that we do,
Oh! God how we long to be
near to You.

It is only that you look and live

CHORUS

Look to Jesus now and live
`Tis recorded in His Word
Hallelujah
It is only that you look and live.

I've a message full of love Hallelujah
A message Oh my brother for you
`Tis a message from above Hallelujah
Jesus said it and I know `tis true.

Life is offered unto you Hallelujah
Eternal life your soul shall have
If you'll only look to Him Hallelujah
Look to Jesus who alone can save."
1371;Look Away To Jesus;;"Born to be a supersign in this great and final age,
When the whole world is falling apart again,
The prudent minds search for solutions,
Which we know they cannot find,
We know the answers lie
Beyond this dimension of time.

CHORUS
I'm looking away to Jesus,
He's the only way, sweet Jesus,
I'm looking away,
I'm looking away to Him.

Born to live in a super sense,
Far beyond what man can perceive.
The Word of God is what our hearts would only believe;
Looking to the unseen,
We see a brighter and better world,
So on the promises of God,
Is what we'd anchor our souls.

Born to overcome this wicked world
That Satan has deceived,
The promises of God is what we'd only believe;
His Word has power to transform
By the renewing of your mind;
To see the judgements of God,
We're at the end of time.

Born to be a super race,
Abraham's royal seed.
Upon the bread of life is what we'd always feed;
Looking for a city whose maker and builder is God,
We know that soon we'll reign
With Jesus Christ our Lord."
1372;Look For Me;;"When you finally make your entrance  to that city,
Oh, just to walk on that bright golden avenue;
As you behold all its beauty and its splendour,
Remember there's just one request
I beg of you.

CHORUS
Look for me,
For I will be there too.
I realize when you arrive,
There'll be so much to view;
After you've been there
Ten thousand years,
A million, maybe two,
Look for me;
For I will be there too.

As you go down your list of firsts, There's no question,
You'll want to see your loved ones
waiting there for you;
And when you feel you've shared your story with the last one
That wants to hear you tell just how you've made it through."
1373;Look To The Lamb Of God;;"If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God;
He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.

CHORUS
Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,
For He alone is able to save you;
Look to the Lamb of God.

When Satan tempts,
and doubts and fears assail,
Look to the Lamb of God;
You in His strength
Shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you aweary,
Does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer
And fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows
On your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow
Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God."
1374;Look What He's Made;;"A lonely manger, a humble God,
The King of heaven came down to fallen earth;
Despised, rejected, disdained by men,
Oh, this child was born
To save men from their sins.

An undefiled and a spotless Lamb,
He gave himself up as the final sacrifice,
But on the third day rose from the grave
Fulfilling that which all the scriptures have said;

And now He lives to give us of His life,
And now He reigns to lift us up on high.

CHORUS
Look what He's made out of nothing,
Look what He's formed out of clay,
Look what He gave to a world that was dying,
Look what He's done through His grace!
Think back to the night when He found you,
Consider the love that He gave,
Remember the love and the peace that He's shown you,
Look what He's done through His grace!
Oh, look what He's done through His grace!

A broken vessel, a wayward heart,
Not a likely place for His kingdom to start,
The great Redeemer, Saviour of men
Oh, my Father came down and brought me home again.

And now I live to thank him for His faith,
And here I stand singing of His grace.
You don't have to look very far
To find evidence of amazing grace,
You don't have to search very far
To see what God can do ,
For He's remained so faithful,
For He's remained so true."
1375;Looking Back;;"Looking back
Now I can see me yesterday,
In places I used to go;
Crossroads everywhere
But there was no one there
To show me the way to go.

Following your dreams,
You're bound to make wrong turns;
Dreamers learn hard and slow;
I need Your guiding Light
To be my second sight
And show me the way to go

If I go astray,
And crosswinds starts to blow
Come into my heart,
And show me
the way to go.

Na Na Na Na Na.
Come into my heart,
And show me
the way to go.
"
1376;Looking For My Change;;"Verse 1

I've come a long way,
I've fear's and doubts;
But in your mind Lord,
You knew i couldn't live with them:
So you choose at this time,
To wave before me

Verse 1
The things you knew would make me,
Give up myself and my thoughts,
It could never have worked by my own works,
But of faith that it might be by grace.
To the end the promise might be sure, to all his seed
Unto us of the faith, the faith of Abraham

Chorus
I'm now looking for the promise of my new body
As my earth quakes all my sin is shaken off
The Holy fire from above put sin out of existence
(For holiness cannot dwell on sinfull earth)x2

Verse 2
But while i am here living in this world, i live by faith of the son of God revealed in me,
To believe his word and claim what's my own,
By promise it was freely given to me,

Verse 2
But when it seems that there's no hope, believe in hope,
And consider not the things which your eyes see,
But looking to the Word of God, that shall not pass away
And it's righteouness which is by faith.

Verse 3
(I'm living in the days
Where my desert is blossoming like a rose
I'm living in the days where my thorns, are unfolding to live again.

Verse 3
It's true fellowhip which is being, restored is the promise of the Lord
I'm looking now for the promise of my change

Verse 4
We are living in the days,
Where our desert is blossoming like a rose,
We are living in the days,
Where our thorns are unfolding to leaves again,

Verse 4
It's true fellowship which is being restored, is the promise of the Lord
I'm looking now for the promise of my change
I'm looking now for the promise my new body,
I'm looking now for the promise of my change"

Of the high calling in Christ
With my eyes fixed on the prize
I can't afford to comprise

And he will deliver me
And I press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ

Like an eagle in the sky,
To soar the heavenly,
And that's what I believe.

And I believe God has given me
The access to claim every promise
That he has made for me;
And I will always believe.

Lord, make my faith what it should be,
Apply Your holy word in me
So I can soar the heavenly
And meet with my theophany.

CHORUS
Lord, give me the grace
And strengthen my faith to take me away;
Lord, give me the grace and strengthen me with faith
That will rapture me away.

Without faith it's impossible
To please You, holy Father,
Breakdown my walls of unbelief
And make my spirit stronger.

And Lord when circumstances come my way
I'll overcome them day by day;
Let my spirit build on solid ground
So I will not be shaken.

Humble my spirit, holy Father,
Make me obedient to thy word;
Apply your holy word in my life
So I can live righteously.

There's a request I'd like to make
The crooked parts of my life
Can you come down and make them straight
Oh how I desire  to be your temple
Consecrated and pure, set aside, for your use
And nothing more,
How I desire to see your stature
Every time I glance at the mirror
Oh your perfect Image shines forth
Out of my life, out of my life
So I can boldly say

In the stature of a perfect man
I'm coming into you
In your image and your likeness

Oh! Oh! Father here I am
I lay before your altar
My all I surrender
Oh perfection, how long
I await translation
The seven steps of the pyramid
The stature of a perfect man

Then you inside my temple
Forever make your domain
So I can boldly say"

Bear me on Your eagle wings so strong.
Lord lift me up on the seventh mountain,
I feel in my heart it's the place where I belong.

In my heart's a desperation,
An anointed expectation,
That a paradox must be performed;
For the deep in me is calling,
For that super anointing,
Where divine love and power just take supreme control.

On my ash heap waiting for Your divine promise,
Your response to my faith in Your Word;
Still trusting in You my Saviour,
My absolute forever;
That You'll finish the work in me
You have begun.

Of its chaos and confusion,
A new heaven and a new earth
I long to see."

Love so divine, love so sublime,
Love that is deeper than any sean;
Love for us all, oh, how can it be!

Verse 1
It was love that sent a Savior
To this world of sin and woe,
It was love that left Heaven's portals,
And came down to dwell below;
It was love that stilled the waters
On the stormy Galilee;
It was love that paid sin's ransom,
One dark day on Calvary.

Verse 2
It was love that heard my pleadings
When I cried out in my sin;
It was love that gave me comfort;
It was love that took me in;
It was love that whispered softly,
""I will never cast you out,""
It was love that eased my heartache;
It was love removed my doubt.

Verse 3
It is love that still is knocking
At the hearts of sinful men;
It is love that never tires,
But that knocks and knocks again;
It is love that solves all problems
In this world of care and strife;
It is love, the love Jesus,
That gives hope, and peace and life."

Or know what tomorrow may bring
If I had faith to move mountains

Without His love I am nothing
For love is the greatest gift of all

Chorus
Love is the greatest gift of all
Love is the greatest gift of all
With God's love in my heart
I can be a shining light
For love is the greatest gift of all

God's love is never demanding
But always is gentle and king
God's love is always forgiving
Leaving our past behind
As I look at the reflection
It makes me feel so small
Without His love I am nothing
For love is the greatest gift of all"

I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more;

Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
Now safe am I

Love lifted me!

Ever to Him I'll cling,
In His blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing,
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul's best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belong.

verse 3
Souls in danger, look above,

Out of the angry waves.

Billows His will obey;

You are the only way

From this world of sin.

Don't be afraid it's not like before.
Don't you give in,
Don't let it bring you down,

But He said, ""I have overcome.""

Tho often tempted, tormented and
tested
And like the prophet, my pillow a

And tho I find here, no permanent
dwelling,
I know He

1437;Many Waters;;"Verse1
There are so many people
in the world today
Don't really know what
true love is;
Many have searched the
whole wide world
And still can't seem
to find it.

Verse1
Love is patient, love is kind,
True love can never be broken;
Love beareth all things,
Love suffers long.
Love is God and God is love,
Who is our King;
But how can you know true love
Without knowing Him?

CHORUS
{Many waters cannot
quench love,
Neither can the floods
drown it,}X3
Whosoever God joins
together,
Let no man put asunder.

Verse2
Therefore shall a man leave father and mother
And cleave unto his wife,
Then they shall be no more twain
But they shall be one.
Then he'll love his bride as Christ the church,
Who giveth Himself for it;

Verse2
For no man yet hateth his flesh,
But loveth and cherisheth it.
Love is God and God is love,
Who is our King;
So how can you know true love
Without knowing Him?"

What can avail
To wash it away?
Look! there is flowing
A crimson tide;

To see His face,

The billows are tossing high!

When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

Chorus
""The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
Peace, be still!""
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
Or demons or men or whatever it be,
No water can swallow the ship where lies
The Master of ocean and earth and skies;
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, be still! Peace be still!
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace, peace, be still!

Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in grief today;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
O waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul!
And I perish! I perish, dear Master;
O hasten and take control!

Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast.
Linger, O blessed Redeemer,
Leave me alone no more;
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,
And rest on the blissful shore."

Look at what you have done
Look at your mistakes;

For the precious blood He shed
On Calvary for a sinner like you and me;
So when your enemy comes
to take away your faith
Point him back to Calvary
where the price was paid.

CHORUS
If we weren't meant to be bride
We wouldn't hear these secret things,
We won't be still standing here
Serving God with our everything,
Didn't He promise us a new body change;

Chorus
Can you feel it now it is your theophany,
There's a voice inside of me
saying we'll be leaving soon,
So press on by the grace of God
And we will make it through.

Verse2
There is a place
prepared for you and me,
It's called our future home
Where we'll live eternally,
And though the battle here is raging
With eyes of faith I see

And temptations did rise to take a look
Unto the other side;
But by the grace of God we resisted sin
And the devils were surprised,
We knew by the Word of the Lord
We were tested and tried;
But unto you who look above
Through the window of perfect love,
God has sent to us His sign
On the wings of a Dove.

As the new ministry becomes reality,
Now men will see with the eye
The works of God expressed through His little Bride,
Every knee must bow, every tongue confess,
Men's folly be made manifest,
The foolish man won't be able to stand;
But unto the wise who understands
Great exploits are now at hand,
For Michael's feet are on the sea and on the land."

Though he

So I left them at the cross,

And with joy I shout and sing

They waited for that blessed hope They seen the grace that's

Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When ends life's transient dream,
When death's cold, sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll;

Fear and distrust remove;
O bear me safe above,

Now how can I be dead and gone
I tell you my life is still going right on.

And should somebody tell you
That I lost my final bout
I hope you don't believe it
Should they whisper, death won out
You  don't have to receive it
My Jesus fought the battle
He conquered death for me
He paid all debt to take me
into my theophany
No I'm not dead and gone No
I'm still shouting shouting right on..

And this robe of flesh I was wearing
It was ordained to break down and decay
But all inside it was bearing a seed of God foreordained
I'm just a stranger, who dropped down into time
Would've traveled onward to a life sublime
No I'm not dead and gone
I'm still shouting shouting right on

And somebody told you
Pastor Chesa has gone on
I hope you didn't believe it
They told you he lived out he's final day
No you don't have to receive it
From this earthly body
My Lord then set him free
How could he die with Zoe life in him
No he's not dead and gone
He's is still going right on

It was a veil of flesh he was wearing
You never saw never saw the real him
But all inside it was bearing,
this child of eternity
This old lifeless body, that u came to see
It was just a clothing , a covering on him
No he's not dead and gone No
He's life is still going right on

Yeah it was a robe of flesh he was wearing
It was ordained to breakdown and decay
But all inside it was bearing a seed of God foreordained
He was a stranger who dropped down into time
Would have traveled on wards to a life sublime.

No he's not dead and gone Lord
He's life is still...
Oh Lord is still...
He's still shouting
He's still dancing
He's  still praising
He's still loving
It's going right on."
1547;My Life Is A Story Of Grace;;"Once I sat in darkness
But then the glorious light of my God shone upon me
It's the Lord of the harvest
Coming down from heaven above
To his chief servant he came
Revealing his plan of redemption for me
Unworthy I am, yet he calls me his own bride
The book of my life, he has opened up
The seals upon it, he has taken off
My sin's reproach has rolled away
My true destiny's now revealed

CHORUS
My life's a story of grace and love
I have a kinsman who cometh from above
He's come to claim me
I am his own
He's taking me to my future home
His mercy has rewrote my life
Through his blood, the perfect sacrifice
Now in union I stand with him
United forever and ever
And ever.

For this great work of love, you have done
Lord my heart is forever grateful to you
Quickened by your Holy Spirit
I am raised in newness of life
Now I understand who I am
I am your attribute manifest in this day
To bear witness of you
To your purpose, for this cause
I came into this world
Seven thunders, seven seals
Seven steps to bring me to perfect rest
Faith of your faith
Life of your life
I am the mystery of you revealed"
1548;My Lines Have Fallen;;"The world's in darkness, they're lovers of pleasures and not of
Their worship shall be slain with pestilence and the sword;
I see the binding of the tares
And gathering of the wheat in the garner
And the Lord's lifted us up to see
oncoming judgement.

CHORUS
So my lines have fallen upon me in pleasant places,
I've seen the goodness and severity of my God;
I have a burden on my heart,
I'm crying ""Abba Father,""
And the power of His influence will lift us up;
And the power of His influence will lift us up.

Lord You opened our eyes to see today's wondering stars,
Alienated from the light that shines in our day,
I see religion, politics and demon powers tangle them up,
And if it was possible it would deceive the very elect.

I see a lying spirit in the World Council of Churches' mouth,
The Lord has put a  word in our hearts to lift us higher,
The smiting stone He let us see from a distance, to burn the earth

I thank Thee Lord for delivering us from the pit,
Oh blessed are our eyes that we see these things!
We know the eyes of the Lord run to and fro  in the earth
For the recipients of mustard seed faith."
1549;My Lord Delivered Me;;"There was a time
I was deep in sin,
No place in my heart
For the Lord to enter in;
Stumbling in darkness,
The way I could not find,
There was a deep in my soul,
I knew I was blind,
Until His light did shine.

CHORUS
My Lord delivered me with His mighty hand,
My Lord delivered me from the sinking sand.
My Lord delivered me, that is why I sing,
My Lord delivered me, I could never stop praising Him.

Now I am a warrior with a battle to
fight,
I'm not afraid for the Lord my Captain is in sight,
He'll point the Silver Sword and I'll obey His Word,
But the foolish man, he can't understand,
I'm His thought made flesh by predestination.

So here we are so great with child,
Resting on that Seventh Peak,
Waiting orders from on high
To exercise the Third Pull,
our inheritance;
But the wicked man cannot understand,
There cannot be any impersonation.

Love one another my brothers,
Let's run this race,
Endure to the end,
For we know we'll see His face.
Grow in grace my sisters,
Let's fulfill all righteousness,
For we are flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone
We'll sit with Him in His throne."
1550;My Lord Knows The Way;;"My Lord knows the way
Through the wilderness;
All I have to do is to follow.

My Lord knows the way
Through the wilderness;
All I have to do is to follow."

1552;My Prayer;;"If my people who are called by my name
Would humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn

Verse1
In prayer and supplication I pour my heart out to you
Sometimes the tears they fall both day and night
Our hands are worn from service,
our dusty feet climb rocky pathways
And all we long for is a touch from the master

Verse1
But I see the finish line, it
So I
For I
Heal your people, heal the land

CHORUS
Heal your people, heal the land
There
My soul is longing for sweet rest
Heal your people, heal the land.

Verse2
Our Father, our Saviour, our good Shepherd {Bishop of my soul}
You
Your glory fills the heavens, it testifies of my redemption
Our sins and shame you nailed them to the cross

Verse2
But I see the wounded soldiers and many who
Lord we won
For your arms are open wide you
Heal your people, heal the land

Bridge1
So like Hannah Lord we cry to you, open the barren wombs
Everything we have need of I know you are more than able and
Like Samson Lord we cry just once more, just once more Lord
I must see life signs in this body

Bridge2
Healing is here, deliverance is here, I know the Holy Ghost is
To restore all that was eaten
House of hell give way, Jerusalem will rise in all her glory
And her vats shall overflow with corn, oil and wine."
1553;My Redeemer;;"I will sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

CHORUS
Sing, oh, sing, of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell

I will sing of my  Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be."
1554;My Redeemer Lives;;"Verse 1
Who taught the sun where
to stand in the morning
And who told the ocean
you can only come this far

Verse 2
And who showed the moon
where to hide till evening
Whose words alone
can catch a falling star.

CHORUS
I know my Redeemer lives X2
Let all creation testify
Let His life within me cry
I know my Redeemer lives.

Verse 2
The very same God
That spins things in the orbit
Runs to the weary, the worn
and the weak

Verse 2
And the same gentle hands
that hold me when I'm broken
They conquered death
to bring me victory.

Verse 3
He lives
To take away my shame
And He lives
Forever I'll proclaim

Verse 3
That the payment for my sins
Was the precious life He gave
And now He's alive and
There's an empty grave.

Verse 4
I know my Redeemer lives
I know, That I know, that I know,
that I know, that I know
He lives my redeemer lives
Because He lives I can face tomorrow

Verse 4
He lives
I know, I know
He lives, I spoke with Him this morning
He lives, The tomb is empty
He Lives, I'm going to tell everybody."
1555;My Savior's Love;;"I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.

CHORUS
How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!

For me it was in the garden
He prayed, ""Not My will, but Thine,""
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me."
1556;My Saviour Crucified;;"I have a loving Saviour
Oh what a Christ have I
To leave His home in Glory
To come to earth to die.
I think of Him so tender
So loving and so kind.
He gave His life for sinners
My Saviour crucified.

CHORUS
And this is why I love Him.
Because He first loved me.
To purchase my redemption
He hung upon a tree.
At last He cried ""Tis finished""
He hung His head and died,
Oh what a sight for sinners,
My Jesus crucified.

They mocked Him
And they scoffed Him,
With thorns they crowned His head,
As a lamb unto the slaughter
My Saviour! -  He was led.
The soldier's cruel dagger
Was thrust into His side,
Oh what a sight for sinners,
My Saviour crucified.

I have a risen Savior,
He means so much to me.
I'm longing for His coming,
His blessed face to see.
I pray I may prove faithful
And in His Word abide.
And one day I shall se Him,
My Savior crucified."
1557;My Sheep Know My Voice;;"My sheep know my voice
And the path that I take,
They follow wherever I go;
My sheep know my voice
And come at my call,
But a stranger's voice do they
not know.

CHORUS
My sheep know my voice
And day by day
They abide in the fold
And go not astray;
They love me because
I have made them my choice
And they follow my call
For my sheep know my voice.

My sheep know my voice
And the pastures of green
Where I lead them so often to feed;
My sheep know my voice and the
cool sparkling stream
Where beside its still waters I lead.

My sheep know my voice
And the valley of death
Through which I shall lead them
some day;
But no danger nor harm can touch
one of them
For I will be with them alway."
1558;My Sins Are Gone;;"You ask me why I'm happy
So I'll just tell you why,
Because my sins are gone;
And when I meet the scoffers
Who ask me where they are,
I say, my sins are gone.

CHORUS
They're underneath the Blood,
Of the Cross of Calvary,
As far removed as darkness
is from dawn;
In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
That's good enough for me,
Praise God, my sins are gone.

'Twas at the old-time altar
Where God came in my heart,
And now my sins are gone;
The Lord took full possession,
The devil did depart,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

When Satan comes to tempt me
And tries to make me doubt,
I say, my sins are gone;
You got me into trouble,
But Jesus got me out,
I'm glad my sins are gone.

I'm living now for Jesus,
I'm happy night and day,
Because my sins are gone;
My soul is filled with music,
With all my heart I say,
I know my sins are gone."
1559;My Sins Were Higher;;"{My sins were higher than the mountain,
When the Lord sanctified me} x2

Chorus

1560;My Soul Be On Thy Guard;;"Verse 1
My soul be on thy guard;
Ten thousand foes arise;
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw you from the skies.

Verse 2
Oh, watch and fight and pray;
The battle ne'er give o'er.
Renew it boldly ev'ry day,
And help divine implore.

Verse 3
Ne'er think the vict'ry won,
Nor lay thine armor down;
The work of faith will not be done
Till thou obtain the crown.

Fight on, my soul, till death
Shall bring thee to thy God;
He'll take thee, at thy parting breath,
To His divine abode."

1564;My Tribute;;"How can I say thanks
For the things You have done for me,
Things so undeserved,
Yet You gave to prove Your love for me;
The voices of a million angels
Could not express my gratitude;
All that I am and ever hope to be
I owe it all to Thee.

CHORUS
{To God be the glory} x3
For the things He has done;

bridge
With His blood He has saved me,
With His power He has raised me;
To God be the glory,
For the things He has done.

Just let me live my life,
Let it be pleasing Lord unto Thee;
And should I gain any praise,
Let it go to Calvary."

THAT CONFIRMS WE ARE GOING HOME.

1566;My Wonderful Lord;;"I have found a deep peace that  I never had known,
And a joy this world could not afford,
Since I yielded control of my body and soul,
To my wonderful, wonderful Lord.

By angels and seraphs in Heaven adored;
I bow at Thy shrine, my Saviour divine,
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

I desire that my life shall be ordered by Thee,
That my will be in perfect accord;
With Thine own sovereign will Thy
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

All the talents I have, I have laid at Thy feet,
Thy approval shall be my reward;
Be my store great or small,

Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross,
a trembling soul,
Love and Mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross!
O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river."

The sun gone down
Darkness be over me my
rest a stone
Yet in my dreams I'll be
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer my God to Thee
nearer to Thee.

There let the way appear
Steps unto heaven
All that thou sendest me in
mercy given
Angels to beckon me
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer my God to thee nearer to Thee

Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise,
So by my woes to be,
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer my God to Thee
nearer to Thee.

Sun, moon and stars forgot upward I fly
Still all my song shall be;
Nearer my God toThee
Nearer my God to thee nearer to Thee."

1649;Never Alone;;"I've seen the light'ning flashing,
And heard the thunder roll;
I've felt sin's breakers dashing,
Trying to conquer my soul;
I've heard the voice of my Savior,
Telling me still to fight on;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

CHORUS
No, never alone!
No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone!
No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

The world's fierce winds are blowing
Temptations sharp and keen;
I feel a peace in knowing
My Savior stands between;
He stands to shield me from danger,
When earthly friends are gone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

When in affliction's valley
I'm treading the road of care;
My Savior helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet, entangled with briars
Ready to cast me down,
My Savior whispers His promise,
""I never will leave thee alone.""

He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side;
For me He opened the fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He's waiting in glory,
Seated upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone."
1650;Never Been Home Sick;;"There's a light in the window
The table is spread and splendor

Chorus
See the bright light shining
It's  just about home time
I can see my Father standing at the door,
This world's been a wilderness,
I'm ready for deliverance,
Lord, I've never been this home sick before.

Sweet faces all familiar
No one's old or feeble anymore,
This lonesome heart is crying;
Think I'll spread my wings for flying
Lord, I've never been this home sick before."

forsaken
Nor his seed begging for bread.

Oh, I know it seems so hopeless,
And you don't know what to pray,
You've done all you know you could
And it seems there's just no way;
And when your darkest hour would come,
Just remember what I say,
I've never seen the righteous
forsaken
Nor his seed begging for bread.

CHORUS
I've never seen God's people
With a need that He could not meet,
I know that He cares for His own
And His promises He'll keep.

So just hold on a little longer,
The answer's soon to come,
The endless waiting almost over,
The victory's almost won,
And when again you feel this joy
Just remember what I say;
I've never seen the righteous
forsaken
Nor his seed begging for bread."

1679;No Condemnation;;"Born in sin, shaped in iniquity,
I came forth in this world
speaking lies,
Separated from the God
I longed to serve,
His Word, this perverted nature
has denied
Oh and I long, oh yes I long
To be rid of this old man,
To become a new creation,
The law of sin in this inward man,
Must be brought into subjection,
My greatest enemy I've realized,
It is me, it is me

CHORUS
And now I see, now I understand,
The great work
that's been wrought for fallen man,
He delivered me from indwelling sin,
Now there's no condemnation,
To those who are in Christ

Elohim, He is determined
He's not going to remain alone
We were created for His pleasure
His workmanship that's what we are
And for fellowship and sweet communion
To be a co-worker with the living God
To live unto His expectation
It's just what He desires for me
It's not what I long to be
For when He died on Calvary
He purchased me, He purchased me

And now it is impossible
I could never, ever be lost
I breathe the very life of God
I came His provided way,
By the Blood of Christ I am washed,
For sin no longer reigns
in this mortal body,
I am a living sacrifice,
My inwards burn constantly,
Refusing to be satisfied
till this glory is revealed in me"

gain

For He in His own time make all

Now with the whole armor, just

Where all the redeemed of all ages

And the glories I there shall behold:
What a joy that will be when my Saviour

In that beautiful city of gold!

The taxes will never come due:
Our garments will never grow threadbare,
But always be fadeless and new.

Verse 2
We'll never be hungry nor thirsty,
Nor languish in poverty there,
For all the rich bounties of heaven
His sanctified children will share.

Verse 3
There'll never be crape on the doorknob,
No funeral train in the sky;
No graves on the hillsides of glory,
For there we shall nevermore die.

Transformed in a moment of time;
Immortal we'll stand in His likeness,

I've seen the lightning flashing,

Telling me still to fight on,
And He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

Chorus
No never alone

He promised never to leave me
Never to leave me alone X2

Verse 2
The world's fierce winds are blowing,
Temptation's sharp and keen,
But I have a peace in knowing
My Saviour stands in between
He stands to shield me from danger,
When all my friends are gone
But He promised never to leave me
Never to leave me alone.

Verse 3
When in affliction
I tread the road of care
My savior helps me carry the cross so heavy to bear
Though all around me is darkness,
Earthly joys all flown
My Savior whispers his promise, never to leave me alone

He did something that no other friend can do.

CHORUS
No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
There's no other friend so kind as He,
No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,
Oh how much He cares for me.

My life was full of sin
When Jesus found me,
All my heart was full of misery and woe
But the Master placed
His strong arms around me
And He led me in the way I ought to go.

Every day He comes to me with new assurance,
More and more I understand His words of Life.
I would never know just why He came to save me,
Till someday soon I'll see His blessed face above."

But all the blood that was spilt
Could never fill that bitter cup,
Till one spotless Lamb in the form of man,
Gave His life on Calvary,
His was the only blood that could ever set me free.

CHORUS
For His blood was not just blood
Of another spotless lamb,
But His blood was precious blood,
For it was to claim back man.
With His blood, He healed my body
And set my spirit free,
I'm so glad for His precious blood
That still flows from Calvary.

No other blood could heal my broken body,
No other blood could save my sin-sick soul,
No other blood can conquer death
And win the victory,
No other blood, than the blood
He shed for me."

Sometimes we're mocked by those who don't believe
Still I love standing up for my Jesus

Nothing preventing the least of His favour,
Keep the way clear!  Let nothing between.

Nothing between like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him ever sever;
He is my all, there's nothing between.

Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self or friends shall not intervene;
Though it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved, there's nothing between.

Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
I'll triumph at last, with nothing between."

You separated me
To walk in a world of perfect faith

Standing as your witness in this day
And though all hell is against me
You promise they'll be under my feet
And wherever I may go
I must let the whole world know
You're not dead
But alive in me

For now's the time to rise up
Now is the time to stand and declare
His name to a dying world
And now's time to shine forth
In the glory of the Lord revealed in you.

You will shine forth like stars in this endtime
You'll fulfill all that my prophet said
But your self will must die
That in you I'll be glorify
That all men will know
Its not you
But its Christ

To set the captives free."

Of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand.
So led by light
Of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men
From orient land.

Lay thus in lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend;
He knows our need
To our weakness is no stranger.
Behold your King
Before Him lowly bend;
Behold your King
Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us
To love one another,
His law is love
And His gospel is peace;
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother,
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.

In grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us
Praise His holy name.

I give Thee back the life I owe,
That in Thine ocean depths its flow,
May richer fuller be.

O light that foll'west all my way,
I yield my flick'ring torch to Thee.
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in Thy sunshine's blaze it's day,

Lowly we kneel in prayer before Thy throne,
That theirs may be
The love which knows no ending,
Whom Thou forever more
Dost join in one.

O perfect life be Thou their full assurance,
Of tender charity and steadfast faith,
Of patient hope and quiet, brave endurance,
With childlike trust that fears no pain nor death.

Grant them the joy which brightens earthy sorrow,
Grant them the peace which calms all  earthly strife;
And to life's day the glorious unknown morrow,
That dawns upon eternal love and life."

My soul takes delight,
On Whom in affliction I call
My Comfort by day
And my Song in the night,

Where dost Thou, dear Shepherd,
Resort with Thy sheep.
To feed them in pastures of love?
Say, why in the valley,
Of death should I weep,
Or alone in this wilderness rove?

Verse 3
O, why should I wander,
An alien from Thee,
Or cry in the desert
For bread?
Thy foes will rejoice,
When my sorrows they see,
And smile at the tears,
I have shed.

Verse 4
Ye daughters of Zion declare,
Have you seen the star,
That on Israel shone.
Say if in your tents,
My beloved has been,
And where with His flocks
He is gone.

Verse 5
He looks! And ten thousands
Of angels rejoice,
And myriads wait for His word.
He speaks! And eternity,
Filled with His voice,
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.

Dear Shepherd! I hear,
And will follow Thy call;
I know the sweet sound of Thy voice.
Restore and defend me,
For Thou art my all,
And in Thee I will ever rejoice."

It descends to the plain,
And sweetly distills
In the dew and the rain.

The sinner's perfect plea.

It tells me what
my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread
a darksome path,
Yields sunshine
all the way.

It tells of One
whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part,

There to sing forever

Dark may be the night,
But I'll cling more close to Him
He will give me light

Turn my thoughts aside;
But my Lord goes ahead,
Leads whatever betide

When in valleys low I look
Toward the mountain height
And behold my Saviour there,
Leading in the fight
With a tender hand outstretched
Toward the valley low;
Guiding me , I can see
As I onward go.

When before me billows rise
From the mighty deep

He doth safely keep
And He leads me gently on
Through this world below

How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by:

Are met in thee tonight.

And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Descend on us, we pray;

Waving us the fullness
Of your Redemption plan,

And the hearts of the fathers revealed to the son.

Oh Lord we see you in Ezra
In the restoration time,
Seeing the word fulfilled,
Line upon each line;
And standing in the seventh watch
Getting riper in the Son,
Soon we'll hear the trumpet and lo, we will be gone."

Don't you want God's bosom
To be your pillow,
Hide me over in the rock of ages

At the sounding of the trumpet,
At the dawning of the day,
Worldly pleasures with their treasures,
Shall forever pass away.

Poor lost sinners will be crying,
For the home they'll never see,
But the ransomed will be singing
Rock of ages, cleft for me."

Galilee, from Galilee,
For He's done so very
much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins,

Ghost within;

Galilee.

in the temple there one day,
he cried, "" O Lord, be merciful
to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin,
and a deep peace placed within;
He said, "" Come see this Man
from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk,
the dumb  Was man to talk,
That power was spoken with
love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see,
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man from
Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night,
to know the way of right,
He asked the Son of man
what must he do.
These words He said to him,
""Ye must be born again,""
By the spirit of that man fro
Galilee.

The woman at the well, He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands she had at that time.
She was forgiven of every sin, and a deep
Peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that Man from Galilee!"""

When by His grace
I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.

When by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in Heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Savior, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me."

Tender and kind,
Helping the helpless,

Holy and harmless,
Patient and brave;
Meekly enduring
Cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer,
Others to save.

Now to receive
Th' anointing divine,
All that I am and have
I am bringing,

Meet for Thy dwelling,
Fit me for life

Oh, what a change
When I shall see His face

Loneliness changed to reunion complete
Absence exchanged for a place at His feet
Sleeping ones raised in a moment of time
Living ones changed to His image sublime

Sunrise will chase all the darkness away
Night will be changed to the brightness of day
Tempests will change to ineffable calm
Weeping will change to a jubilant psalm

Weakness will change to magnificent strength
Failure will change to perfection at length
Sorrow will change to unending delight
Walking by faith change to walking by sight"

The old rugged cross
Till my trophies
At last I lay down
I will cling to the
Old rugged cross
And exchange it some day
For a crown

So despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction
For me
For the Dear Lamb of God
Left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In the old rugged cross
Stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see.
For 'twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me.

I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach
Gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day
To my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share"

And a million lambs could never
pay the price

Carrying the sins of every man
Upon his shoulders

Tearing down the separating wall
And the price was paid in full

Falls like rain from heavens holy

To everyone who calls upon his

And though we all were sinners
He loved beyond our weaknesses
And though we were unworthy;

He came to suffer in our place
And as his blood fell to the ground
All hope again was found
No longer are we guilty and
oppress
For he has thrown our sins as far
as east is from the west"
1761;Once In Royal David's City;;"Verse 1
Once in royal David's city,
Stood a lowly cattle shed;
Where a mother laid her baby,
In a manger for His bed.
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ, her little Child.

Verse 2
He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all;
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall.
With the poor and meek and lowly,
Lived on earth, our Savior holy.

Verse 3
Jesus is our childhood's pattern,
Day by day like us He grew;
He was little, weak and helpless,
Tears and smiles like us He knew.
And He feels for all our sadness,
And He shares in all our gladness.

Verse 4
And our eyes at last shall see Him,
Through His own redeeming love,
For that Child so dear and gentle,
Is our Lord in heaven above;
And He leads His children on,
To the place where He has gone.

Verse 5
Not in that poor lowly stable,
With the oxen standing by;
We shall see Him but in heaven,
Set at God's right hand on high.
There His children gather round,
Bright like stars with glory crowned.

Verse 6
And through all
His wondrous childhood
He would honor and obey,
Love and watch the lowly maiden
In whose gentle arms He lay;
Christian children,
All must be mild, obedient,
Good as He."
1762;One By One;;"One by one Jesse's sons stood before the prophet.
Their father  knew a king would soon be found.
Each one passed except the last.
No one thought to call him.
Surely he will never wear a crown

Chorus
But when others see a shepherd boy
God may see a king even though your life seems
filled with ordinary things in just a moment
he canl touch u and everything will change.
When others see a shepherd boy God may see a king.

One by one problems come and dreams get shattered
sometimes its hard to understand things
like chance and circumstance they dont really matter
our father holds tomorrow in his hands.

Well he wasn't the oldest he wasn't the strongest
chosen on that day yet the giants fell
and nations trembled they stood in his way."
1763;One Day;;"One day when heaven
Was filled with His praises,
One day when sin
Was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth
To be born of a virgin -
Dwelt amongst men,
My example is He!

CHORUS
Living, He loved me;
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried
My sins far away;
Rising, He justified
Freely forever:
One day He's coming -
Oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him
Up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him
To die on the tree;
Suffering anguish,
Despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins,
My Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him
Alone in the garden,
One day He rested,
From suffering free;
Angels came down
O'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless,
My Saviour is He!

One day the grave could
Conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled
Away from the door;
Then He arose, over death
He had conquered;
Now is ascended,
My Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will
Sound for His coming,
One day the skies with
His glory will shine;
Wonderful day,
My beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour,
This Jesus is mine!"
1764;One Day At A Time;;"verse1
I'm only a human, I'm just a woman
Lord help me believe in what
I could be and all that I am

verse1
Show me the stairway I have to climb
Lord for my sake teach me take
One day at a time

Chorus
One day at a time sweet Jesus
That's all I'm asking from you
Just give me the strength to do
everyday what I have to do

Chorus
Yesterday is gone sweet Jesus
Tomorrow may never be mine
Lord help me today show me the
way one day at a time

verse2
Do you remember when you
walked amongst man?
Well Jesus you know, if you look
here below it's worse now than then.

verse2
Pushing and shoving,
crowding my mind
Lord for my sake teach me to take
One day at a time."
1765;One Day Jesus;;"Some days drag and some
days fly
And some days I think
Of the day I'll die
Some days fill me
And some days drain
And one day Jesus
Will call my name

Chorus
One day Jesus will call
My name
As the days go by
'hope I don't stay the same
I wanna get so close to Him
That's it's no big change
On that day that Jesus calls
my name

Most days I pray
But some daysI curse
And number of days I put
myself first
But it's not what I do,
The cross made that plain
And one day Jesus
will call my name"
1766;One Love;;"Chorus
One love, one love, one love, one love

Verse1
There was a time in the history of man
When he commanded the creation,
And he and his Maker had one love;
And then the deceiver came,
And man lost the power of the Name;

Verse1
For he had broken the bond of one love;
It then took the blood of a spotless lamb
To be an atonement for fallen man,
It was God's substitute for his sin and shame;
It was a part of God's great mystery
To redeem you and me again. Back to..

Verse2
Then one day the real Lamb came,
He came in the Father's Name
To be a ransom for one love.
When on the cross my Saviour died,
The power of death He had defied,
To give us the token of one love;

Verse2
He then changed our destiny,
He could now come and live in you and me,
Making us creatures now bound for eternity;
Brothers and sisters can't you see,
He died to set you and I free
again! Back to..

Verse3
The Holy Ghost the Lord did send,
He fell upon some redeemed men,
They had the Token and one love.
They baptized in Jesus Name;
And of His doctrine they weren't ashamed,
For they were believers in one love;

Verse3
But then as the ages rolled away
From this doctrine evil men did stray;
And the serpent began to ride this trail again.
Beware of the creeds of wicked men,
Designed to bring us back to bondage again. But you stand firm..

Verse4
In the end time the Son of man
came,
He came in His Father's Name
To give us the Token of one love.
Seven Thunders sounded in our souls,
Our Lord had gathered us from this wicked world
To be united in one love;

Verse4
Then we will speak and command creation again,
Sons and daughters in the Father's Name,
Having power and wrapped up in His love;
The trumpet shall sound
And we'll take our flight to the skies
To be in glory where we'll be with our Father again. Back to..

Verse 5
We Can see this was the mind of God
That we have come to be with you now
And we have the Token, and one love
From the other end of the world
The Lord has gathered us for this true worship time
And we are united in one love

Verse 6
Some have come from the far America
To be united with you Zimbabweans
And all others of like precious faith
The trumpet shall sound and will take a flight
to the sky to be in glory
Where will be with the father again
I can see

Verse 7
We Can see this was the mind of God
That we have come to be with you now
And we have the Token, and one love
From the other end of the world
The Lord has gathered us for this true worship time
And we are united in one love

Verse 8
Some have come from the far South Africa
To be united with you Zimbabweans
And all others of like precious faith
The trumpet shall sound and will take a flight
to the sky to be in glory
Where will be with the father again"
1767;One More Time;;"The road that I travel is not always
an easy path.
The trials that I face sometimes they
set me back.
And the mountains that's before me
I wonder if I can climb
For there's one thing that I ask Lord;
ONE MORE TIME.


CHORUS
One more time, dear Jesus, Just give
me grace to stand
One more time dear Jesus, I need your
guiding hand
I'm not asking Lord for you to move the
mountains from my path.
I'm just asking, ONE MORE TIME
For grace that I can stand.


It seems such clouds of darkness are
gathering today.
Though I can see the sunshine break
through along my way.
I know there's good and bad times Lord:
are suffering Christian paths.
So there's one thing that I ask Lord.
ONE MORE TIME LORD."
1768;One Of Them;;"verse 1

And are telling now, both far and wide,
His pow'r is yet the same,
I'm so glad that I can say
I'm one of them!

verse 3
They were gathered in the upper room,
All praying in His name,
They were baptized with the Holy Ghost,
And pow'r for service came;

verse 3
Now what He did for them on that day
He'll do for you the same;
I'm so glad that I can say
I'm one of them!

verse 4
Come, my brother, seek this blessing
That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy-bells ringing
And will keep the soul aflame;

All glory to His name,
I'm so glad that I can say
I'm one of them!"

And Lord how we long for you to come and fill us now
Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly Dove brood over us
Find your resting place in our hearts

And by Your blood we rebuke all lying vanities
Though an host encamp against me
To release fear and insecurity

And only He can change your life
And make you whole.

Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise,
Which can never fail.

At the sign of triumph,
Satan's host doth flee;
On, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise

Loud your anthems raise!

In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honor,
Unto Christ the King;

And the sufferer's tears will dry,
When our Savior shall come back

To Zion then with joy,
And in all His holy mountain
Nothing hurts or shall destroy;
Perfect peace shall reign in every heart,

After Jesus shall come back

No satisfaction for this deep and inward hunger,
Clouds of darkness hovered o'er me trying to blind me,
The Light broke through, the shadows flew, and now I can see.

I have heard about the inspired declaration,
Made by ambassadors for Christ from South in Trinidad,
The move is on for the chosen ones by election;
The local Bride is gathering in for the adoption.

Seven Voices thundered out in this hour,
Anointing hearts and lives with overcoming power;

Changing from glory unto glory for Redemption,
Perfect Love uniting hearts for translation,
Perfect Faith conquering death for resurrection."

Have no fear, have no fear,            You will be there.

Jesus said it's a narrow rugged way,
And few there be that find it,
But broad is the way which leads to destruction
Where millions travel along,
But though our trials are tough and afflictions much,
It's not worthy to be compared
With the joys that the faithful servants of God
Someday shall surely share.

Set your eyes on the White rock
That Light is now shining on,
Turn not your eyes away from God's message today,
Till you shine with the light of the Son.
For you've been made by God to be a reflection of Him,
Let it be settled in your heart and mind,
That we are a Super Race ordained of Grace;
And there's where happiness you will find.
Shoo those buzzards off your sacrifice
When temptations come your
Believe not the devil's lie,
Though those vultures fly,
Continue to watch and pray.
For there's a path that the eye of
Has never, ever seen,
Where you as an eagle can fly perfectly justified
For you are a heavenly being.a"
1795;Out Of Time Into Eternity;;"Verse 1
Storms of life are raging
Gross darkness fills the earth
There
Pestilence and famine And wars on every hand Violence sweeps through the lands

Verse 1
But the Word of our Lord
Reveals a place of refuge
Where the righteous can run
and be saved When we
The death angel can

Out of darkness into light Out of death into life Out of time into eternity

Verse 2
Chaos and confusion Men
As terror strikes around them
Despite all the destruction
They still cling to worldly cares

Verse 2
They keep living in despair
But the children of God Abides
in peace and safety Far away from the oncoming storms
In the cleft of the Rock
We are completely sheltered
As we wait for the last trump to sound

BRIDGE
There
Then none shall be healed none shall be saved
This world is again falling apart as our
Prophet said So enter in now
before it is too late

No more death only life

Spread your wings prepare for
flight Faster than the speed of light
Out of time into eternity"
1796;Over The Next Hill We'll Be Home;;"By the way the land is laying
I think I'll be safe in saying
That over the next hill we'll be home
It's a straight and narrow highway
No detours and no byways
And over the next hill we'll be home

Chorus
From the prophet , I've been hearing
How he said the end is nearing
For I see familiar landmarks all along
By the dreams that I've been dreaming
There will be agreat redeeming
And over the next hill we'll be home

By the speed we been making
I would say there is no mistaking
That over the next hill we'll be home
There's a place that we are nearing
That so many have been fearing
And over the next hill we'll be home

By the pull that has been coming
There will be a great homecoming
And over the next hill we'll be home
There's a place that we are nearing
That so many have been fearing
And over the next hill we'll be home

By the turn the tide is been taking
I would say there is no mistaking
That over the next hill we'll be home
There's a place that we are nearing
That so many have been fearing
And over the next hill we'll be home

When we get there we're certain
That we'll find the gate is open
There will be a refuge from the
coming storm
For the way has been long and weary
For the lost the end is nearing
And over the next hill we'll be home."
1797;Overcomers;;"Seasons change new life springs forth
Showing signs of resurrection
The germ of faith lay dormant in your soul
It's now growing to perfection
The challenges you face
Are not worthy to be compared
with the glory He sees in you
Because you've kept the faith
A stranger did not follow
You believe in who was sent

CHORUS
Over-comers over-comers
You've wrestled with the angel
Till He changed your name
Over-comers over-comers
Your life depict the scriptures
See God is still the same
as He was yesterday

Living epistles read of all men
Prisoners for Jesus
You hold this mystery so dare to your heart
It's now becoming tangible
No longer words on a page
but a living reality God express in you
Because you know who you are
You'll triumph over darkness
You'll triumph over fear

BRIDGE

And as you're walking
your life depict the scripture
We know the mystery
of God is Christ in you
And when you're speaking
you speak with revelation
Revelation 10: 8 to11 that's who you are

CHORUS

Refuse to let the devil rise
And shake you from your place
Over-comer over-comer

See God is still the same
as he was yesterday"
1798;Overcoming Power;;"The Message came in this last age
To prepare a Bride
To walk with Him and talk with Him,
And in His Word abide
It's written in the Spoken Word
And it's laying there
To bring us into Rapturing Grace
And take us out of here

Overcoming power
is what we have today
Overcoming power
to keep the devil away
Overcoming power
so we'll become the Word
That's when we'll leave this
sinful earth and go to meet the Lord

We have passed the seventh age,
The power has to come
The scientists have gone to work,
They're sure to get the job done
Our sins and weights to lay aside
Our sins and weights to lay aside,
And we'll set everything right;
So when the inspiration falls we'll just take off in flight.

Our Moses has already gone,
He has prepared the way,
He brought us to the Jordan,
And he was taken away;
But Joshua is preparing now to sound out His command,
To gather all the saints of God to enter the Promise Land.

This day will I begin to magnify thee in the people's sight,
You and I were eye witnesses at Mc.Allister Street that night;
Also in the Hospital we had witnesses there;
By inspiration, ""In seven days time,
You'll be walking out of here.""

We've planted flags, we've placed our stones,
We had testimonies there,
They will serve as memorials to drive away all doubt and fears.
On June the 3rd that's when the Lord rolled our reproach away,
Beyond a shadow of a doubt,             I, Jesus Christ, is here."

Thank You Jesus, I'm part of Your bride.

1814;Passport To Heaven-poem;;"Passport to Heaven: no border jumper on Jordan Boarder Post;
One of these days, O what a day so close!
One of these close days, O what a great day!
On this great day,

O what a mixed pot!
In this mixed pot, O what a wailing and joy!
When Heaven-Immigration Department shall ask:
Show us your Passport.

Passport to Heaven, everybody ought to have;
A child is born, a gift to the world;
A gift to the world knowing no sin;
Knowing no sin but with a packed sinful nature;

Sinful nature loaded, lies packed and idle;
That child grows, sin catches up, without Sin-Training;
Without the Holy Ghost, the glorious Passport, doomed we are!

Passport to heaven, a requirement not an option;
Israelites in bondage, taskmasters venomously inhuman;
Venomously inhuman upon the chosen nation;
For the chosen nation, a deliverer, at last came;

""Every Israelite, on your doorposts apply the blood!""
Irregardless of the signs and wonders witnessed in multitude,
Everybody were to get that token: the Exodus Passport.

Passport to heaven, amazingly no winding queue at the Passport Office;
Everyone busy, no time to apply, no time to wait;
Just a handful of people willingly to wait in the heat or rain

The Passport Officers, no customer care: serving only the serious;
The process so rugged, birthpains preceeding a perpetual smile
The way up is the way down on your knees: kneeology the way;
Night and day fighting to get that Passport to heaven.

Passport to Heaven, no bribe no dignity, strictly no nepotism;
Everybody to faithfuly wait, His time to ripen;
""I'll not leave thee before thou blesses me!""

Wrestle for the Passport, the document is only for Warriors;
Soldiers of the Cross, Military devine;
The hotter the battle, the sweeter the victory;
Yes, soldier on, the Passport you'll surely hold."
1815;Past The Curtain Of Time;;"There's a curtain that's drawn

Lord, let me look past the curtain
of time.

CHORUS
Lord, let me. look Past the curtain
of sorrows and fear,
Let me view that sunny bright clime;
It would strengthen my faith and
would banish all fear;
Lord, let me look past the curtain
of time.

I'm helpless, alone, and I want to
see Jesus,
And hear the sweet harbor bells
chime,
Where, my friends and dear loved
ones are waiting for me;
Lord, let me look past the curtain
of time.

I'm so homesick and blue, and I
want to see Jesus,
I would like to hear those sweet
harbor bells chime;
It would brighten my Path and
would vanish all fear;
Lord. let me look past the curtain
of time."

By Christ on the cross peace was made,
My debt by His death was all paid,
No other foundation is laid,
For peace, the gift of God's love.

When Jesus as Lord I had crowned,
My heart with this peace did abound,
In Him the rich blessing I found,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

There's nothing but peace doth betide

1833;Pilgrim Journey;;"My pilgrim land journey
Too even and easy,
And dull over long distances,
Across the plains too hard and painful
Up the steep grades of life, I groan.

Chorus
There's an unseen hand
Helping me in trials
And I'll never, will never get lost
Lord Jesus my help,
Never leave me alone,
Help me to the end of this life.

On the summit of the mountain,
A magnificent view
I feel exalted with the tears of joy.
I want to sing
And I wish I had wings
Very painful
For I just can't stay there.

I seem  to forget my summit experience,
As I climb the other side of life,
There's an unseen hand
Helping me all the time
Jesus is my unseen hand of help."

As an elect that's been chosen by grace
And I  see the evil of man
I know I'm from another place

CHORUS
On the earth I'll be a pilgrim
On my way to glory there's so much pain I must endure
I'll fight the good fight, I'll keep the faith
I'm forward to glory and my eternity is assure
Oh I am a pilgrim
Oh a child of God

As I strive daily oh Lord
Lead me by your grace
For my one and only prize
Is to see you face to face

Daily as I walk with Christ
The revelation comes clearer to me
That on this dying earth
I'll have no continuing city.

What will I present to Christ
At the end of my journey ?
I overcome him by the blood
And the word of my testimony."
1835;Possibility;;"Is there a possibility?
Is there a possibility?

Samson now defeated
The victor now a victim
His eyes have been taken out
The seven locks have been shaven
The Philistines now are gathered
For Samson to make spot

Is there a possibility?
Is there a possibility?

Samson
His lips are moving
He
Between the two pillars
A new crop of hair is growing
And he feels a supreme anointing
Then he bows with all his might

Oh!
Just one more time Lord!
Just one more time Lord!
Let me die with the Philistines
But let your power come again x 2

Yes!
There is a possibility
There is a possibility
For dead that he slew were more than they
He had killed in all his life
Yes!
There is a possibility
There is a possibility

Samson caught the vision of the possibility
And he prayed right

Oh!
Just one more time Lord!
Just one more time Lord!
Let me die with the Philistines
But let your power come again x 2

There is a possibility
There is a possibility

Though the churches have organised
To bring the squeeze upon the Bride
But between the two revivals
The seven locks are growing
The Bride a new generation
She feels a supreme anointing
As she stands between the pillars
She
And then she will speak!

Oh! Lord
Just one more time Lord
Just one more time Lord
Let me die to the world and sin
But let your power come again

Just one more time Lord
Just one more time Lord
Let me die to myself
But let your power come again

Let the latter rain come, the revival of the just
Let the seven thunders roar
Giving us rapturing faith
A refilling of the Holy Ghost
The dynamics of this church
Let the persecution rise
For the Spoken Word creation power
Let the Mount Zion showdown come
And God will show who is who
For the Bride will ride this trail again
In the mystery of the second fold
She will wind up the commission
And will take her flight through the sky

Just one more time Lord!
Just one more time Lord!
Let me die with the Philistines
But let your power come again x 2"

CHORUS

There is power in prayer if you believe
He is standing right there for you to receive
For the problems you face
He is all that you need
There is power in prayer

BRIDGE

He is a God that won't fail when friends let you down
So cast all your cares on him cause I've found
He can take your heartaches and turn it around
There is power in prayer

I prayed a prayer but no answer came
My days turned to weeks
My grief turned to pain
And I cried oh Lord, seems like you have not heard my prayer
But God said I heard the first time you called
Satan tried to block your answer to stall
Reinforcements been made
Satan had to withdraw
There is power in prayer

In fond memory appear.

gladness bringing,
From that lovely land
somewhere.

As I travel
on life's pathway,
Know not what the
years may hold;
As I ponder, hope
grows fonder,
Precious memories
flood my soul.

Flood my soul from day
to day,
I remember
scenes so precious
That can never pass away.

I've heard the Message
and Its signal
That day's end is near
at hand,
But I remember that He
promised
He'd return for those
who'd stand.

Precious memories,
glorious meetings
Across this land from
sea to sea
Where I heard the
prophet's Message
That brought Life and
hope to me.

Where the Food was
laid away,
We've returned to where
he stored It,
Spiritual Food against this

Present your body as a living sacrifice

Present your body as a living sacrifice
It's your reasonable service
For you've been bought with a price

The precious blood of Jesus
Of the sinless spotless Lamb
Shed for you and I fallen man
How He loved us with a love
Even before this world began
Considered you and I
In his redemption plan
How we should love him
And be prisoners of his word
Bound by the chains
Of love divine

The whole creation groaneth
And travaileth until now
For the manifestation of the sons of God
He's rent the veil of vain tradition
Brought his image in plain view
Now veils his glory
In oddballs like me and you
Now we despise Satan's Eden
Die to ourselves day by day
Perfect faith is the victory
We must attain

Quote Romans 8:35-39

A servant at suppertime
Came with the secrets
In God's mind
Proclaimed our liberty
Bringing many sons to glory
How we tore out filthy rags
In exchange for robes so clean and white
To sit in God's presence
Taking our place in his plan
How we should be thankful
He has chosen you and me
We are the reason we are his victory"

Life is just an empty dream!
(Just eat, drink and be merry.)
And the soul is dead that slumbers;

And things are not what they seem.
Life is real! And life is earnest!
And the grave is not its goal;
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
Was not spoken of the soul;

Lives of great men remind us,
And we can make our lives sublime,
With partings leave behind us,
Footprints on the sands of time;

Footprints, that perharps another,
Sailing over life's solemn main,
For forlong and shipwreck brother,
Seeing shall take heart again;

Let us be up then and doing,
With a heart wherein we strive,
Be not like dump driven cattle, be a hero.

Behold a new day,
And we sing glory to the Lamb."

Let peaceful waters flow,
Learn to be still my soul.
Let me hear
Jesus walking near,
Touch me Lord, and quiet me.

And dreams not yet begun,

In so little time;
Yet there is nothing that  can replace
All the times I seek Your face;
Oh Lord, I want Your perfect will
For this life of mine."

Down here and planning ahead,
So busy with their fortunes
They forgot what Jesus said:
About the wars and earthquakes
And the fig tree's budding leaves,
But there's a group of people
Getting ready to leave!

CHORUS
Ready to leave
In a twinkling of an eye,
Making investments
In the bank up in the sky!
I've made preparations -
Not a reason to grieve.
Are you in that number
Getting ready to leave?

Sinner, what's the reason
For your needless delay -
While you're hesitating,
Christ could come just any day!
Heed the Spirit's calling,
Make your way to Calvary,
And get in that number
Getting ready to leave!"

Chorus
I'm ready to move, move on up to another dimension
I'm ready to change relocate to another location
There's nothing to hold me here no more
I'm already out the door
I've got the Holy Ghost here to prove
I'm ready to move

Well, everything that I need is in order
Ready now to cross the border
To a brand new country bright and fair
But I hold a little revelation
This body is gonna see a translation
Moving up to my mansion in the air."

Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night."
1881;Redemption By Blood;;"I felt death's sting, I had sensed its snares,
Its cruel pain brought bitter tears;
How could I escape when judgement was sure?
Who could plead my cause?
And when God saw there was no one
He sent to die His only Son,
For only through blood His wrath could have been appeased.
His justice was satisfied when blood flowed from Calvary.

CHORUS
Redemption by blood,
Oh wretched man that I am,
Who shall deliver me
From the body of this death,
And who should set me free,
taking me out of this desert?
But I thank God through Jesus Christ,
And His death on Calvary,
It brought for me redemption by blood.

I felt the chains bind my soul within,
Serving that slave master sin
By reason of my bondage I sighed
And God heard my cry,
Remembering His covenant
A prophet He did truly send
With the Word of truth
To break the strongholds within,
And totally deliver me from the power of in-dwelling sin.

CHORUS

Redemption by power,
Oh wretched slave I was made,
Who shall deliver me from the bonds of slavery?
And who shall set me free,
Taking me from my captivity?
But I thank God through Jesus Christ,
And His death on Calvary,
It brought for me redemption by power.
Redemption by blood, redemption by power,
In completeness and joy
Redemption for me."

I was living in darkness
He shined a light around me
So I could see  my way out
But when the Lamb wrote the claim
I clearly saw my name
When  stop to think about it
I let out a great big shout.

It is there he suffered and died
And by His stripes believe you are healed
So when your burden seems so heavy
Like you can't go on
Remember Calvary

When they nail Him on the cross
I was on his mind.
Who am I?
That a king should bleed and die
When I think about Jesus
And all that He has done
I remember Calvary

For the mountains shall depart
And the hill be removed
But my kindness shall not depart from you
Don't let the things of this world
Disturb your peace
Remember Calvary

The love of Jesus is so pure
That's the reason why we must love Him so
So I will lay down my life as a living sacrifice
Because of Calvary"

We were not made to be affected by the underworld

Where all his attributes
They will be expressed

And as the time draws closer and closer
And time elapses into eternity
In my heart there grows a faith
To quicken this mortal state
And make me what I ought to be

To take my flight like the eagles in the sky
My face is set towards the sun
And the day is almost done
Like the eagle we will be renewed

Verse2
We were not made to live under pressure
We were not made to live up and down each day
But God had it in his mind
He had a space of time
Where he

Verse2
And as the end draws closer and closer
We feel the pull from the celestial world
And the things of earth just fade
And our burdens roll away
When we think of the things that are to be

Verse3
Where there
Where there
And we heard so many times of this place beyond sublime
And this is where, where I long to be
And the line grows thinner and thinner

And we get conscious of the unseen world
The sleeping saints want to return
And we long to be fully robed
Never to be earthbound again"

CHORUS
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

Tho' they are slighting Him,
Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried
That grace can restore:
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken
Will vibrate once more.

Rescue the perishing,
Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor
The Lord will provide:
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand'rer
a Savior has died."
1891;Ressurection Of The Bride;;"I've heard of Moses crossing
The mighty red sea
And I've heard of Joshua leading
Israel to victory
But in this day I'm looking for
Present tense reality
I'm looking for the literal life of Christ
To form in me

CHORUS
In the resurrection of the Bride
We can hear the thunders sounding
The pull is deep inside
And I am hearing Him call my name
So I'm looking for the quickening power
For the rapture and the change

We've heard of Jephthah and Gideon
Of David's mighty men
And we've heard of the power of Samson
When that spirit came on to him
So today we are looking for
The third pull on display
When the mind of Christ is in the Bride she'll say

We know Bro. Willie and Wilson
Bro. Leon too
And Bro. John and Frankie Jacobs
Saints who stood tested tried and true
Sleeping saints and over comers
Victorious in this age
And in the better resurrection
They'll be raised

This pull brought us out from Moab
And from gleaning in the field
Where we met with the Lord of harvest
Whom His chief reaper has revealed
And now is the time of purging
We're on that threshing floor
We're being cleansed and sealed to sin no more
The token is what we're longing for
The end time Words come back to seed
The little Gentile Bride, she must conceive
For a blast of thunders and a prophet's shout
Its full redemption will bring us out
From the field of gleaning
Into God's house

Third pull power and authority
I want my body change
And theophany
Oh yes, the sleeping saints will rise
And the Bride will take her flight
When the resurrection power is formed in me"
1892;Resurrection Morning Medley;;"On that resurrection morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
We'll have a new body praise the Lord
We'll have a new life

With the saints and we shall gather
Over on the other shore,
We'll have a new body
Praise the Lord we'll have a new life

By and by when the morning comes,
When all the saints of God are gathered home;
We'll tell the story how we overcame,
We'll understand it better by and by

Well i've wondered so aimless
Life filled with sin,
I would not let my dear saviour in;
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night,
Praise the Lord i saw the light

I saw the light,
I saw the light
No more in darkness
No more in knight
Jesus has found me
He gave me sight
Praise the Lord
I saw the light

Some glad morning
When this life is o'er
I'll fly away,
To a home on God's
celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

CHORUS
I'll fly away, oh glory,
I'll fly away;
I won't die,
Hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows
Of this life have grown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird from prison
bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more
Weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys
shall never end,
I'll fly away.

There are people almost everywhere,
Whose hearts are all aflame,

They were baptized with the Holy Ghost,

That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy-bells ringing
And will keep the soul aflame;

All glory to His name,
I'm so glad that I can say
I'm one of them!

I know it was the Blood,
I know it was the Blood,
I know it was the Blood for me;
One day when I was lost,
He died upon the Cross,
I know it was the Blood for me.

verse 1
Would you be free
From your burden of sin?
There's pow'r in the blood,
Pow'r in the blood;
Would you o'er evil
a victory win?
There's wonderful pow'r
in the blood.

In the blood of the Lamb;
There is power, power

In the precious blood

Would you be free
From your passion and pride?
There's pow'r in the blood,

Come for a cleansing
to Calvary's tide;
There's wonderful pow'r
in the blood.

verse 3
Would you be whiter,
much whiter than snow?
There's pow'r in the blood,

Sin-stains are lost
in its life-giving flow;
There's wonderful pow'r
in the blood.

Would you live daily
His praises to sing?

Christ our Redeemer
died on the cross
Died for the sinner
paid all his due;
Sprinkle your soul
with the blood of the lamb,
And I will pass ,
will pass over you.

CHORUS
When I see the blood

When I see the blood
I will pass,
will pass over you.

Chiefest of sinners,
Jesus will save;
All He has promised,
that will He do;
Wash in the fountain
opened for sin,
And I will pass,
will pass over you.

Judgement is coming,
all will be there,
Each one receiving
justly his due;
Hide in the saving,
sin cleansing blood,
And I will pass,
will pass over you.

Oh, great compassions!
O boundless love!
O loving kindness,
faithful and true!
Find peace and shelter
under the blood,
And I will pass,

1893;Return Of The Spring Son;;"The bible opens with the seventh seal
Though it took such a long time to be revealed
In the earth there were seeds
God called for light and when He said 'Let there be..'
The seeds were quickened and they sprung forth
Out of a darkened earth they were called
To manifest the life that lay within
Their Creator was glorified in them

At the rising of the S-U-N (3x)
Life springs forth

When Jesus died they laid His body away
But He was destined to rise again and on third day
A Mighty Angel descended from heaven
To give witness He was the new creation
T'was the first dawn and the first sunrise (A dual sunrise)
Quickening power brought His body to life
In victory He marched through death's door
The saints of old arose and walked on earth once more

At the rising of the S-O-N (3x)
(A dual sunrise)
Life springs forth

I sat with Job as he lay on the ash pile
God said
Let nature talk to you for a while
We saw hope for a tree when the stalk is in the ground
At the scent of water it will bud (and bring forth)
The greatest vision broke to us right there
We saw the resurrected Christ appear
Death's wrath was just like winter it must go
We came forth with a testimony of 'I know'

At the return of the Spring Son  (3x)
I'll come forth

We saw the risen Christ when the Cloud appeared
On sunset mountain He met with us there
Said I'll return according to the time of life
In this second cycle we see life signs in the bride
Then He appeared again in 1976
Opened our understanding to the holy script
He made Himself known in the breaking of the bread
Quickened our minds to our promise and our lives to our age

It's the return of the Spring Son  (3x)
And we've come forth

As in the beginning so is it in the end
We are now walking in Revelation 10
We heard the shout, we're now in the voice
Evening time resurrection surely is on
He's now unveiled and to us He appears
Manifestations shows His personal presence is here
We're waiting for the sounding of the last trump
The sleeping saints will rise and we'll be raptured up

It's the return of the Spring Son  (3x)
And we've come forth"

verse 2

I'm just a little lump of vanity,
Like a flower that blooms and fades away,
Its mortal life withers every day.

verse 2
But Lord, You've given me eternal life:
You've even called me Your virtuous wife;
You've brought me to a place,
Right where I belong.

verse 3
Who am I? Lord let me die,
Just let Your Name be glorified,
At Your service Lord, here I stand,
Your wish, oh Lord is my command;

For You died to set me free,
And You did it so willingly,
To bring me to this place,
Right where I belong."
1896;Ring The Bells Of Heaven;;"Chorus 1
Glory! Glory! How the angels sing!

Pealing forth the anthem of the free.

Verse 1
Ring the bells of heaven!
There is joy today,
For a soul returning from the wild!
See the Father meets Him out upon the way,
Welcoming His weary wand'ring child.

Verse 2
Ring the bells of heaven!
There is joy today,
For the wand'rer now is reconciled.
Yes a soul is rescued from His sinful way,
And is born anew a ransomed child.

Verse 3
Ring the bells of heaven!
Spread the feast today!
Angels swell the glad triumphant strain!
Tell the joyful tidings;
Bear it far away!
For a precious soul is born again."

'Cause I'll rise again
Ain't no power on earth,
Can tie me down,

1902;Rise And Shine;;"We lived our past in pleasure

for the Lord has come
We'll rise and shine
we were made to overcome

By holding the vision before every decision that's how we
The Lord is having then the preeminence
We'll trust him ever and doubt him never
All the promises he has made
Realizing there is no need to be afraid for his word can never fail

We'll suffer affliction by his confession the scripture has foretold
We consider our trials more precious than gold
Leaving these worldly pleasures far behind for greater riches we
Never mind the reproaches you bear for his name for God's

Amidst this worlds frustration we have restoration
The earnest of the Promise Land only be thou courageous and
We have the hidden manna six barley measures
We're awaiting that final one
Our Lord won't  rest till his work is done
We'll have the fullness of the sun

It'll  make super humans over every condition by the power of his
Holding our confession unto the end
And by his election we'll change dimensions to a world that's so
No more to be mortal creatures of time
There forever we shall shine"

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save,
and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy Cross I cling.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

Let me hide myself in Thee."

I came to Him, my sins
confessed,
There was room at the
fountain for me;
When I gave up, my heart
was blest,
There's room at the
fountain for thee.

I plunged beneath the
crimson tide,
There was room at the
fountain for me;
And now by faith am
sanctified,
There's room at the
fountain for thee.

I found the crimson
stream I know,
There was room at the
fountain for me;
His blood has washed
me white as snow,
There's room at the
fountain for thee.

He cleansed my heart
from inbred sin,
There was room at the
fountain for me;
And now He keeps me
pure within,
There's room at the
fountain for thee,

I'll praise Him while He
gives me breath,
There was room at the
fountain for me;
He saved me from an
awful death,
There's room at the
fountain for thee.

His blood was shed
but once for all,
There was room at the
fountain for me;
Oh, don't reject sweet
Merey's call,
There's room at the
fountain for thee.

We'll sing with all the
saints above,
There was room at the
fountain for me;
And praise Him for
redeeming love,
There's room at the fountain for thee."

Studying those maps and charts so we won't come up lost

What the prophet to the age did say
This is what our captain says today

Through tempestuous winds and many raging storms
But our captain keeps her steady on her course
Unto the land God has promised us
Many ships and sailors stopped at ports along the way
Others became shipwrecked because their captain did not stay
With the instructions that were given by the angel in this day
To say exactly what the angel says
This is what the captain says today

A power that is to come back to the church
In that hour missing limbs will be restored
The dead raised the sick healed by the word"

For a draught from some cool spring

Only mocked my soul's sad cry.

Untold wealth that never faileth,

His wonders to perform
He plants His feet on every step
And then He rides on every storm
Well He fixed my feet for runnin', boys
Then my eyes were opened up wide
He fixed my tongue so I could say
""Praise God, I'm satisfied.""

Verse 2
Well it was way down yonder in the valley, boys

And then He drew me up to His side."

Lest my heart should yearn for the darkness
And from this light I walk away
Lest I ever try this perfect truth deny
Save me from my erring way
Restore me to the FAITH I pray

I see many come to know this truth that I love so
But with time their faces just can't be found
Take their way to doubting end

By the enemy's deceiving scheme
Till the day He calls for me
Let me faithful be
No matter how hard my way may seem"

And provide a robe and crown.

Lift their songs of saving grace.

Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace."

And bone of my bone.

As He beholds His lovely Bride at last;
And with joy will the angels sing,
What adoration from the Seraphim!

Objections considered, all hollerings will cease,
All other women will have to hold their peace;
He whispered to us in a language unknown,
And now the beauty of His Bride will be shown.

Oh, the mystery that the two have now become one,
And the victory of all ages is finally won;
Flesh of His flesh, bone of His bone, we are the same,
United we stand under that special name.

And leads her unto the promised land,
Humble woman, He has chosen for His own,
Will sit with Him as Queen upon His Throne."

1964;Since God Drew Me;;"Like the prodigal son in sin
I wondered far away
from my father
Although I thought
that I had the answer,
success in life was my goal
But the father I wronged
with sorrow I beheld
Till I came to the end of my road

Chorus
Since God drew me
I found joy everlasting,
joy in my soul
Since God drew me I have peace,
resting peace within my soul

Like Joshua and Caleb
I want to go through
till I reach that promised land
And I know each day
that He will help me
overcome by His amazing grace
By faith I see the victory ahead
Praise God! Hallelujah!
I am shouting victory.

I have peace in my soul"

Since I have been redeemed.

Since Jesus came into my heart,
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Floods of joy o'er my soul

What a wonderful change
In my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul,
For which long I have sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

Verse 2
I have ceased from my
Wandering and going astray
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins which were many
Are all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

Verse 3
There's a light in the
Valley of death now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And the gates of the city
Beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

Verse 4
I shall go there to dwell
In that city I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I'm happy, so happy,
As onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

That is steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart;

Revealed to our hearts by His last day prophet
To quicken the germ of life that laid inside us
And to resurrect the faith that lay dormant;
And no longer are we children held in darkness,
But His bride, looking more to be like Him,
Waiting  to be translated on that great day
At His blessed glorious coming.

CHORUS
Sing glory to God, hallelujah, for His message,
It has quickened our hearts so we can see
The fulfillment of God's Word in this hour,
In the lives of simple you and simple me.

This message was not sent to educate us,
But for us to recognize who we are
And to take away every bit of amnesia from our souls
And to take us back to God where we belong.

Don't you realize, saints, who is here among us?
It is God Himself veiled in human skin,
Fulfilling every Word that He has promised,
And changing us from glory unto glory.

So keep humble, keep sincere, keep obedient
To the Words He has spoken to your hearts;
And He shall bring to pass all that He has spoken,
Making you a living epistle read of all men.

So like Esther, let us submit to Him our head-ship,
And like Ruth mark the spot where He lay;
And like Mary, let our lives in accord to His will,
And like Sarah, let our lives bring forth the promise."

His Son,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
He saves through the
crucified One.

Oh, perfect redemption for sinners,
The purchase of Jesus' own blood,
The vilest offender is pardoned,
Is saved through the promise of God.

Rejoice, then, rejoice all ye people,
The wondrous transaction is done,
The life-gate is opened, come enter,
Through Jesus the crucified One."

His gracious mercy keepeth;
By morning glow or evening shade,
His watchful eye ne'er sleepeth.

To God, all praise and glory.

Verse 3
The Lord is never far away,
But, thru all grief distressing,
And everpresent help and stay,
Our peace and joy and blessing.

He leads His own, His chosen band,
To God, all praise and glory.

CHORUS
Let this song be something about this message,
Like Christ the Mystery of God
Revealed or the Seven Seals,
Desperation, The Token or Leadership or The Future Home,
Lord, let me sing Your bride a song.

Well, I've always wanted to do something special for Jesus,

You saved our souls, provided our every need
Lord, we were lost, but by grace we were found

Why we sing, why we lift our hands,
And there are still many, many who fail to see
That's it's not us but Jesus in you and me.

CHORUS
Sing unto the Lord shout His praises
He's our conqueror, our deliverer, our strength,
Sing unto the Lord, your redeemer
From the ends of the earth, we lift up our voices in praise.


Lord, it is you, who comforts me
In pain and suffering tender mercies we see
We'll not complain, all we can do is praise
With our hands and our lips, our voices to you we raise,

We know that demons flee at the mention of your holy name
So shout to the Lord, let us his name proclaim
Now with one voice we will march, we will sing
Those Jericho walls will fall never to rise again."

Singing I go along life's road,
Praising the Lord, praising the Lord;
Singing I go along life's road,
For Jesus has lifted my load.

Verse 1
The trusting heart to Jesus clings,
Nor any ill forebodes,
But at the cross of Calvary sings,
""Praise God for lifted loads!""

Verse 2
The passing days bring many cares.
""Fear not,"" I hear Him say;
And when my fears are turned to prayers,
The burdens slip away.

Verse 3
He tells me of my Father's love,
And never slumbering eye;
My everlasting King above
Will all my needs supply.

When to the throne of grace I flee,
I find the promise true;
The mighty arms upholding me
Will bear my burdens too."

I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place
Now I live and breathe in freedom with each breath of life I take
Loved and forgiven
Back with the living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace

Verse 1
If you could see what I once was
If you could go with me
Back to where I started from
Then I know you would see
A miracle of love that took me in it's sweet embrace
And made me what I am today
Just an old sinner saved by grace.

Verse 2
How could I boast of anything I've ever seen or done?
How could I dare to claim as mine the vict'ries God has won?
Where would I be had God not brought me gently to this place?
I'm here to say I'm nothing but a sinner saved by grace

Let
The last seal has been opened,
The three-fold mystery has been proclaimed,
The message of the smaller birds was healing,
The message of the larger birds was discernment,

The constellation of angels is the coming of the Lord,
And all these things have been accomplished and we are living in them.

O what words I hear him say!
Happy place! so near, so precious!
May it find me there each day;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
I would look upon the past;
For His love has been so gracious,
It has won my heart at last.

Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Where can mortal be more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And, when weary, find sweet rest;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
There I love to weep and pray,
While I from his fullness gather
Grace and comfort every day.

Bless me, oh my Savior, bless me,
As I sit low at Thy feet;
Oh look down in love upon me,
Let me see Thy face so sweet,
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
Make me holy as He is;
May I prove I've been with Jesus,
Who is all my righteousness."

1983;Snared In An Evil Net;;"A mighty hunter is on the loose
He's capturing everyone he could
He found a way to connect the world
He's got them now under his control
Could you see how the trap is set
The whole world is caught in the net
Many think it's just a brand new wave
But it's the return of the Global Village
The mighty hunter has found the way
To catch his prey in this evil day

Chorus
But thank God we're free
He's given us eyes to see
So we could escape this evil captivity

See the thoughts of a foolish man
He thinks he has such a very good plan
But he's built on sand so his house will shift
Cause his foundation a silicone chip
See how the world has gone off to sleep
Through that window they took a peep
The web has bound them they can't escape
They're being taken through Hell's gate

See how this hunter lures his prey
Enticing the world with the words he says
Through Jezebel (he) evokes laws, speaks lies
With painted faces it's all disguised
But little bride this word you hear
Is to deliver you from his snare
Watch ye therefore and pray always
That you counted worthy to escape"

His burden light
His yoke is easy
No fuss nor fight
May I never complain
Or murmur Lord
His yoke is easy
His burden is light

He gave His Life for me
Made everything right
He is my Everything  ---, He is my All"

We know the end time

Chorus
So just be faithful
Believe His Word
Stay with the Message
That you have heard
List' to His prophet
His Message heed
Walk in the Light where
His star doth lead

In every church age
A star did shine
To help God's people
A truth to find
In this last church age
A star shines bright
So friend receive it
Walk in the light

Do not be fearful
Or filled with dread
Your prophet sleepeth
He is not dead
The Bride is waiting
Now for that Voice
And in this hope
We can now rejoice

His Word of promise
He gave the Bride
From his white Charger
The prophet cried
""Yet one more time shall
I ride this trail""
Thus Saith The Lord
Can never fail"

When Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger
And heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

Time is now fleeting,
The moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering,
Death's night is coming,
Coming for you and for me.

Oh! for the wonderful love
He has promised,
Promised for you and for me;
Though we have sinned,
He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me."
1988;Sold Out;;"I count all things but down,
That I may win Christ in this day,
And all myself and pride, Lord please take it all away,
I lay aside every weight of sin,
The law of flesh have no more part with me,
I circumcised it all; my life no longer belongs to me

CHORUS
Because I am sold out to Jesus,
Though tested and tried, I will still glorify his name,
I testify of him without fear of persecution,
He deserves the glory, the honour and praise

A burden in my soul,
To bring onto my king a clean fresh drink,
When I see his desire, I can
Out of this virtual world, he brought me into an unfailing reality,
I am sealed within; my life no longer belongs to me

Where he leads me, I will follow,
Where he sends me, I will go,

Help the wounded,
Though it hurts you leave the dead.

At the ready all the time,
Be of courage and conviction
Hit the mark, toe the line.

I know you've done your best.
Let  me give you peace,
Let me hold you for a while,

But don't forget, don't forget,
You're still My child.

Soldier, standing on the battle line,
Finding comfort in my water and new wine,
Know I am with you when the
world keeps a-charging in,
And I'll be with you,
I'll see you through to the very end.

Soldier, keep my flag flying high,
Don't let it fall in battle,
Or be stolen in the night,

Don't you lose your battle cry,
'Cause My army's fighting with you,
And I am standing by your side."

I just feel like something good is on its way;
He has promised that He'll open all of heaven,
And brother this could be that very day,
When God's people humble themselves and call on Jesus;
And they look to heaven expecting as they pray,
I just feel like something good is about to happen;
And brother this could be this very day.

I have learnt in all that happens just to praise Him,
For I know He's working all things for my good,
Every tear I shed is worth the investment,
For I know He will see me through,
He said He would;
He had promised eye or ear could hardly fathom,
All the things He has in store for those who pray,
I just feel like something good is about to happen and brother this

Yes, I've noticed all the bad news in the papers,
And it seems like things are getting bleaker every day,
But for the child of God it makes no difference,
Things are gonna get better any way,

Sunshine always bursting through the cloud of gray,
I just feel like something good is about to happen,
And brother this could be the very day."

Something is breaking between mortal and immortal
The son's coming up removing darkness of night
The key's being given opening dimensions
Life and immortality is coming to light

A seal breaks open, a man caught a vision
Heard the voice of a prophet saying ""sail on, sail on""
And just like Abraham he's in search of another land
The unseen is now being made visible
As dove leads eagle

When crisis arises the world gets in birth pains
They see the need to go forward
Then the anointing falls upon the vessel
Who has been ordained
To lift us up on a higher plain

Through each unfolding, the way is opening
Spiritual scientist working by laws to achieve this rapturing faith
Thru secret passages, seven steps up the pyramid
Where we'll  run through death
Leap over into supernatural realms

Something is breaking between mortal and immortal
The Son's coming up removing the darkness of night
After this mountain eternity sets in
That's the real world we're gonna live in"
1998;Something Is Gonna Happen Here;;"God knew we didn't have a revelation of how to approach him

A church without sin where his gifts can manifest
So how we settle for a weak and empty life
When the spirit is calling us to higher heights
Saying stay here at Mizpah

Something is going to happen here
There are ministries of angels
Something is going to happen here
Cast not away your confidence
Something is going to happen here
It's God strength versus human strength
Something is going to happen here

So as we pray we lift you up Father
For we see what you have done for us and we glorify your Name
We remember what was done in the bible at Mizpah when our
When they offered up their sacrifices

And I wondered could there be anything
That You could make or use in me
But then the Son came out one day in all His glory
And I felt in me a change
And I knew right there and then the way I was dying
That I was being born again

Something so wonderful
You've made me so much more
Than I ever thought I could be

My leaves are green with fellowship
And my bough goes over the wall

By the rising of the Son
New life in me has begun
Something so beautiful
You have made of me"

For there's just something special about that mountain,
Though many valleys to cross
He's more than worth the pain,
There's just something special about that mountain,

With the One who has chosen me to bear His name.
I just want to be faithful,
Just to love and serve Him again and again.

I long for the fullness of Eternal Life
To share a glory that will never fade away;
And I long for my precious new body
Where no sickness or pain would ever be again.

I long for full dominion,
It's my inheritance, a son of God I am;
I long to go back to Eden,
It's my future home where I'll
always be.

For there's just something special about that mountain,
Though many valleys to cross
He's more than worth the pain.

Iniquity all around
Judgment has come down
For rejection of God
We see Lucifer and his kingdom
Come to kill and take possession
With Jezebel at his side
To persecute this little Bride
Sound the alarm in Zion!

This message has been preached
Gone out to the elected

Will be filthy still

To Israel God will turn
The tares bundled to be burnt

Having known who we are;

are.

We have arrived at that junction in His Word,
We have arrived where something must give way;
The faith of God that is locked up in our hearts,
We'll speak this very Word;
We'll see His glory pass.

Our prophet spoke and he believed the Word,
Our prophet spoke and squirrels did appear;
God's redeemed Church  has reached up to that sphere,
Inside that little room where the power cannot fail.

Enter in there where the Light went in that room,
Enter in there where the Angel said He'll meet you;
You'll come out whole, with your crutches in your hand,
Leaping and praising God for there's power in that room."

touched the prophet,
Making him as pure

When the voice of God,
said ""Who'll go for us?""
Then he answered,
""Here I am send me.""

Listen to their sad

Hasten, brother
Hasten to the rescue

May the Lord of harvest

May we hear His blessed

Speaking better things for me
Speaking pardon and liberty
Showing me what was done on Calvary

It has told me my sins are gone
It has told me I am his son
It has told me he has prepared a place for me

I've seen his vesture dipped in blood
I've come back to renew my vows to him
That is why I am here again
I've come back to see the Lamb that was slain

We heard the emancipation proclamation
We have seen the risen Son
Out from the slave fields of sin we came
In search of another land

We keep coming back to this place
Cause it holds for us such great treasure
Each time we see this bloodstained vesture
The price of our freedom we remember

And praise this lamb who for us was slain
And with him we will be in eternity

And I thank God for the old rugged cross
It's shame and reproach I gladly bear
I'll cherish the old rugged cross
And I'll exchange it some day for a crown"

Looking towards the sky
When I saw a storm approaching
And I feared that I would die
And I saw Gods creature's run and seek
A better place to hide
As the thunders roared down in my soul
And I bowed my head and cried

As the clouds was moving faster
Lightning flashing bright
Clouds so dark they hid the sun
And it seemed that it was night
When all at once there was a feeling like I never had before
Up above those clouds you should have heard me singing
God has given me eagles wings

So spread your wings little eagle and fly
You weren't born for the valley you were born for the sky
Don't let your trials get you down or dive your spirit to the ground
Mount up with wings little eagle and fly

All at once God's spirit moved me high above it all
I didn't even have to move my wings
The holy spirit had control
I was soaring high above my circumstances
My confusion and all my pain
Though I spent many years in the old barn yard
I was always an eagle by his name"

Oh, say, can you see,
By the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,
Thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched,
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare,
The bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night,
That our flag was still there.
Oh, say, does that star-spangled
Banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free,
And the home of the brave?

Verse 2
Oh, thus be it ever,
When freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes,
And the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace,
May the heav'n rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made.
And preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must,
When our cause it is just;
And this be our motto:
""In God is our trust!""
And the star-spangled banner
In triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free,
And the home of the brave.

Verse 3
On the shore, dimly seen
Thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host
In dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze,
O'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows,
Half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam
Of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected,
Now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner;
Oh, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free,
And the home of the brave.

Verse 4
And where is that band,
Who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war
And the battle's confusion,
A home and a country
Should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out
Their foul footsteps' pollution;
No refuge could save
The hireling and slave
From the terror of flight
Or the gloom of the grave.
And the star-spangled banner
In triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free,
And the home of the brave."

than He was the day before.

Chorus
The half cannot be fancied
this side the golden shore;
Oh, there He'll be still sweeter

His glory broke upon me
when I saw Him from afar;
He's fairer than the lily,
brighter than the morning star;
He fills and satisfies
my longing spirit o'er and o'er;
Each day He grows still sweeter
than He was the day before.

My heart is sometimes heavy,
but He comes with sweet relief;
He folds me to His bosom
when I droop with blighting grief;
I love the Christ who all my burdens
in His body bore;
Each day He grows still sweeter
than He was the day before."

A mighty man of valour
You faced your enemy
And with the sword you've slaughtered
You had sweet victory
But it gets bitter
When you're tried in the fire
And it gets hard sometimes
But pleasing to the soul;

Yet if you choose to leave your place
Who will stand instead
For this cause were you chosen
To see that devil dead
So keep on fighting
Fighting with all the faith
Keep looking towards the vision
For the hour now is late.

CHORUS
So I'll put on the armour of God
I'll put on the shield of faith
Trusting in the Sword of the Spirit
Pray with sincerity and truth
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood
But principalities and powers
And rulers of darkness
And here I stand in truth
Still tied to my Absolute.

Verse2
I've read it in the Bible
Joshua 5:14
God came down as Lord of Hosts
Israel was defended and positioned
And David slew the lion
Looked back  to his experiences
And then he smote Goliath;

Verse2
And I am of that pedigree
Why should I run and fear
I'll speak the Word with revelation
I will not surrender till I walk upon
The ashes of that wicked one
Till I stand face to face

Verse 1
As it was in the days of Noe,
Science was more advanced than now;
It's one minute before midnight,
It's later than we think;
Jesus shall come
(To catch His Bride away) x2

Chorus 1

Narrow is the way;
There'll be a few
That find this way.

Make a choice now,
Make a choice for Christ
Or die with the lost
In doctrines of men;
(You'll be cast away on that day) x2

Verse 2
Millions claim to be Christians,
But denying the very power of God,
It's one minute before midnight;
Blind leading blind,
They'll fall,
Yes, falling in the ditch;

Strengthen my hands for war

Strengthen my hands for war
I want to fulfill this word with power

For though two hundred million is gathered against me
In this I'll be confident
If God before me tell me who could be against me
For they are more with us than they with them

For there remaineth much land yet to be possessed
Many promises to be fulfilled
Can't let circumstances or conditions get us down
For we must fulfill his will

For the mark of this age is perfection
And to miss that mark saints is sin
For Alpha must become Omega
The Word made flesh again

For we know that the walls will be built in troublous times
In a time of scoffers and mockers
But we are determined that the House of God will live again

But my life was always protected by an unseen power;
Greater was He that's in me than the white horse rider,
As my eagle wings of faith grew stronger and stronger;
Now I'm risen far above the powers of deception,
I have mounted the heavenly currents by revelation.

From darkness I've been lifted to heavenly places,
Amazing grace has taken me from unrighteousness;
Born a star, I do delight in His glory,
But what of my people who yet stumble in iniquity;
Now in position, set in my course,
I'll reflect a light beam in their way,
Oh, let the risen Son turn their darkness into day.

Queen Esther, your light is becoming brighter,
Not many days now, you'll display the King's power;
Rise and shine, oh let your light shine in this hour,
Let this wicked world be shaken by a supernova.

And run not before Him,
Whatever betide.

Still trust in His word.

Take time to be holy,
Be calm in thy soul;
Each thought and each motive
Beneath His control;
Thus led by His Spirit
To fountains of love,
Thou soon shalt be fitted
For service above."

But we'll meet where death has no victory
In a land where we'll never grow old

To restore her purity.

Oh, tell me of the greatest love story,
Oh, tell me about of a Man called Jesus,
Who died for me.

Who died for me.

I look back and see.  He was always leading me.
What was meant for evil,
God has used to show me His great love.
I now understand the tender hand of Jehovah.

Many Jews were killed and sawn asunder.
It seemed that God had left His very own.
But through it all God had a plan, little did they know,
That He would lead His children all back home.

So how can I deny His hand of mercy?
When trouble came and left no reason why?
I just stand and say that everything has worked out for my good.
He has all the answers to my life.

CHORUS
It was the tender hand of Jehovah.
I look back and see.  He was always leading me.

Before the class would start

Each life somehow touched by your generosity

Sacrifices made

But I know they were tears in your eye

She always takes the time to
Let me know I'm understood
And I remember thru the trials
She'd say He's working for my good
And she prayed for my dreams
And she prayed for me.

Can be a lovely thing

And these clothes are not new
I don't have much money
But Lord I have You
And to me that's all that matters;
Though the world may not see,
Oh thank you Lord for Your blessings on me."
2110;Thank You My Lord;;"Thank You my Lord
I want to thank You
For the rest of life."
2111;Thanks, Thanks;;"Verse 1
Thank You Lord for the strength you give
To simply carry on
Through those scolds and tests,
And the worst and best,
I'm never left alone.

Verse 1
You're always right beside me
To hear me when I pray.
Since I first began You've been my dearest friend,
I give You all the praise.

CHORUS 1
Thanks, Thanks I give You thanks,
For all You've done.
I am so blessed,
My soul is at rest,
Oh Lord, I give You thanks.

Verse 2
I give You thanks this moment
And I will continually.
For each day I live Your grace
You give,

Verse 2
I am blessed abundantly,
And I won't forget that moment
When, in my life, You made such a change.
Since the Spirit came I've not been the same,
I want to give You praise.

Chorus 2
Thanks, Thanks we give You thanks,
For all You've done.
We are so blessed,
Our souls have found rest,
Oh Lord, we give You thanks."
2112;That Beautiful Name;;"Chorus 1
That beautiful name! That beautiful name
From sin has power to free us!
That beautiful name! That wonderful name!
That matchless name is Jesus.

Verse 1
I know of a name, a beautiful name
That angels brought down to earth.
They whispered it low,
One night long ago
To a maiden of lowly birth.

Verse 2
I know of a name, a beautiful name
That unto a babe was given.
The stars glittered bright
Throughout that glad nigh,
And angels praised God in heaven.

Verse 3
The One of that name, my Savior became
My Savior of Calvary.
My sins nailed Him there,
My burdens He bare.

Verse 4
I love that blest name
Made higher than all in heaven.
'Twas whispered, I know,
In my heart long ago.
To Jesus my life I've given."
2113;That Man From Galilee;;"In a manger long ago,
I know it's really so,
A Babe was born
To save men from their sin.
John saw Him on the shore,
The Lamb forevermore,
Oh, the Christ,
The Crucified of Calvary.

CHORUS
Oh I love that Man from Galilee,
For He's done so very much for me.
He's forgiven all my sins,
Placed the Holy Ghost within;
Oh I love that man
from Galilee.

The publican went to pray
In the temple there one day,
He cried, ""O Lord
be merciful to me!""
He was forgiven of every sin,
And a deep peace placed within;
He said, ""Come see this Man
from Galilee.""

The lame was made to walk,
The dumb was made to talk,
That power was spoken with
Love upon the sea;
The blind was made to see,
I know it could only be
The mercy of that Man
from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night,
To know the way of right,
He asked the Son of Man
What must he do.
These words He said to him,
""Ye must be born again,""
By the Spirit of that Man
from Galilee.

The woman at the well,
He all her sins did tell,
How five husbands
She had at that time,
She was forgiven of every sin,
And a deep peace came within;
Then she cried, ""Come see that
Man from Galilee!"""
2114;That Soundds Like Home To Me;;"Verse 1
Somewhere just across the Jordan river
There is a place of everlasting joy
And a crown of life is waiting there for me

Chorus
That sounds like home to me,
Thats where i long to be
There will be no tears to
fill our eyes again
As we sing of His grace and
Glory where the saints of God will be
That sounds like home to me

Verse 2
They say there are mansions
there inside the city
The crystal river flowing
down the tree of life
No pain no disappointments
there forever
And Jesus Christ our God
will be the light

"
2115;That Sounds Like Heaven To Me;;"That sounds like home to me,
Like where I want to be.
There'll be no tears
To dim our eyes again.
The hills will echo with the story
As we sing of His grace and glory;
Where the saints of God will be--
That sounds like home to me."
2116;That's What We're Here For;;"
CHORUS
Let us come with a singleness
Of heart with one purpose
Let's achieve the plan of God for
Our lives while we're in this body
That's what we're here for x2
Let's drink from the fountain
Of God the living Word

Now is the time where we are
Have to fight to win the battle
Now is the time to receive the
Holy Ghost inoculation to be able
To overcome the world
There is no more room for
Playing church
For we're facing the dawn
Of a new day
Let's all rise from our sleep
And fight with everything that
Is within us

Let's lay aside every weight of unbelief
Let's go back to the path of the old fashioned Holy Ghost gospel
Every soldier back to your position!
Hold firm the sword of the Word.
With diligence let's get rid of sin from our lives
Then we are sure to reach the mark of perfection.
"
2117;That's When;;"Verse 1
When you have a work to do,
And the task ahead seems bigger than you,
That's when He steps in;
When you know in your  heart,
It's God's command: Takes more,
Than can be done by man,
That's when He steps in.

Verse 1
He sees you at the point of your need,
He sees you at the point of crossing,
Your Red Sea;
In that moment you call,
When you give Him your all,
He steps in, He steps in...
And He'll say...

Chorus
What's that you have
In your hand?
I can use it,
If you're willing to lose it;
Just take a little you have,
And make it great,
For I Am El-Shaddai.
I can more than supply your need.

Verse 2
When all you have,
Is oil in a jar,
Tha'ts a reflection of where,
You're now,
That's when He steps in.

Verse 2
A llittle boy's lunch of fish and bread,
Is all you you have,
For the need ahead,
That's when He steps in,
Let Him take it,
And bless it,
And break it,
And give  it,
He'll multiply it.

Verse 2
In the moment you eat,
In that moment you call
When you give Him your all,
He steps in,
He steps in...
And He will say..."
2118;That's Why I Call Lord;;"I was taken from His side
When my Lord bled and died,
The earth shook, and all of nature's pillars cried.
On that sad and mournful day,
The sun went down and hid away,
When by blood, Jehovah-God purchased His Bride.

CHORUS
That's why I call Him Lord,
Lord Jesus Christ,
That's why I call Him Lord,
Jesus Christ.
I'm a new creation,
I'm His flesh, I'm His spirit, I'm His bones,
And I'll tell the world He's Lord,
And we two are one.

Several times I've let Him down,
But my slide made His love more strong,
From His side flowed reconciling love,
Such a Love the world don't know;
Such a Love it could never show;
It took the Dove to bring it down from up above.

For a sign, just to show the world,
That my Gene was celestial,
From His side, royal blood did
flow.
Oh, the serpent's head was crushed well done,
Hallelujah to God's Holy One!
Who by His blood has brought me back to my God."

2121;That’s My Prayer- Victor Cicia;;"I REMEMBER MANY YEARS AGO WHEN ABRAHAM
WAS RETURNING FROM THE SLAUGHTER OF KINGS
HE MET THE UNSEEN KING OF SALEM, WITHOUT FATHER,
WITHOUT MOTHER, OH WITHOUT GENEALOGY,
HAVING NEITHER BEGINNING OF DAYS NOR END OF LIFE.
EVEN HIS NEPHEW LOT, MUST HAVE SCRATCED HIS HEAD
IN DISBELIEF, HOW COULD AUNCLE DEFEAT THE ALLIED FORCES.

CHORUS
THAT
TO WALK BY FAITH AND NOT BY SIGHT IN THIS
MOST EVIL AGE.
I HAVE GOT THE MECHANICS BUT WITHOUT THE DYNAMICS
TO KEEP ME MARCHING ALONG THE KING

I REMEMBER MANY YEARS AGO WHEN MOSES WAS,
UNDOUBTEDLY, TO BECOME THE NEXT PHARAOH.
WITH THE KINGSHIP OF THE ENTIRE WORLD ALL IN HIS HANDS
BUT HE CHOSE TO LOOK AT THE UNSEEN.
HAVING LOOKED AT THE UNSEEN HE HAD TESTED SHIKINAH GLORY
FOR HE WAS YOURS BY ELECTION AND NOT BY JOINING.
EVEN THE RULLING PHARAOH MUST HAVE SCRATCED HIS HEAD
IN DISBELIEF, HOW COULD MOSES TURN DOWN SUCH AN OFFER."
2122;The Access;;"What is it with the secret of the access
which Abel found
When man was lost and fell away from God
This shepherd brought a sacrifice of blood
The tree of life by then was sealed
But as he approached he held the key
That opened up the way to God
He could have fellowship
With the father once more

What is it with this secret
Enoch caught the revelation of
That he built the pyramid
Encrypting things for ages to come
This way through blood  revealed to him
Seven steps to the chamber of  the king
He walked with God and was not found
He transcended dimensions

It was the same access  shown in Jacob
The gate to heaven to him was revealed
Angels passing to and from with
messages for the redeemed
Oh what great value is  the access given you and me
The secret of the access (3x)

What is it with the secret of the access Paul unveiled
He showed that lamb was Jesus Christ
How He became our perfect sacrifice
And the work done on the cross
Completely redeemed Adam
Access by faith into this grace
We now have peace
With the father once more

What is it with the secret of the access our prophet had
That formed him in the image  again
The stature of a perfect man
The spoken word made manifest
Was displayed  as evidence
Seven seals opened up the way

Bringing man across the chasm again
We gained this access when the cycle returned
By Him decrypting to us the language unknown
Entrance ministered abundantly
The pathway to glory is clearly seen
Angelic ministry initiated us into this mystery

Verse1
The secret of the access which Abel found
He brought a lamb
The secret Enoch caught a revelation of
Transcending  dimensions
Job
I have heard but now I see
The access Abraham received

Verse2
Was bread and wine from King Theophany
The secret of the access in Jacob
Moses used this  access and the Red  Sea was opened
The secret of the access Joshua found
He spoke and stopped the sun
The secret of the access through sacrifice
Elijah brought the rain

Verse3
In God
Prayer and faith was the access key
The secret of the access Paul unveiled
The perfect sacrifice
The secret of the access Brother Branham had
Spoken word created squirrels
The secret of the access Hattie Wright received

Verse4
She struck the channel God responded
The secret of the access Revelation 10:7 had
The secret of the access Revelation 10: 8-11 has
The Bride
You Queen Esther has
The secret of the access that we have
The secret of the access

Oh what great value is the access given you and me
The secret of the access"
2123;The Adoption;;"chorus
The Adoption -
full Redemption
All authority and power
Is restored unto
the Bride
In this great hour

verse 1
I was troubled
and confused in Laodicea
No satisfaction for this deep
and inner hunger
Clouds of darkness
hovered o'er me;

Verse 1
Trying to blind me
The Light broke through
the shadows flew
And now I can see.

Verse 2
We are quickened
by this blessed revelation
Changing from glory
unto glory for Redemption;

Verse 2
Perfect Love uniting
hearts for translation
Perfect Faith conquering
death for resurrection."
2124;The Advent Of Our God;;"Verse 1
The advent of our God,
With eager hearts we greet;
And we must praise Him in this hour,
With hymns and anthems sweet.

Verse 2
All glory to the Son,
Who comes to set us free;
With Father, Spirit ever One,
Through all eternity.

Verse 3
The everlasting Son,
Incarnate stoops to be;
Himself the servant's form
Puts on to set his people free.

Verse 4
Come, Zion's daughter,
Rise to meet your lowly King;
Nor let your faithless heart despise
The peace He comes to bring.

Verse 5
As judge, on clouds of light,
He soon will come again;
And all His scattered saints
Unite with Him on high to reign.

Verse 6
Before the dawning day
Let sin be put to flight;
No longer let the law hold sway,
But walk in freedom's light."
2125;The Altar;;"Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

The service is nearing an end
The choir is singing ""Just as I am""
And now as the old song is played
People at the altar are kneeling down to pray
Some are finding mercy forgiveness for their sins
Some are fighting battles and they are struggling to win
The time has come to give them to the Lord
That's what the altar is for

That's what the altar is for
You don't have to carry those burdens anymore
There is light in the darkness there is a love that's true
Jesus is waiting he is waiting here for you
Go quickly now before they close the door
That's what the altar is for

The father is praying with his son
The mother kneels besides them
Thanking God they've come
An old man standing there in tears
Giving up his whole life, back to the Lord
Hearts are being broken, lives are being changed
Those who call upon him will never be the same
The time has come to give them to the Lord
That's what the altar is for

That's what the altar is for
You don't have to carry those burdens anymore
There is light in the darkness there is a love that's true
Jesus is waiting he is waiting here for you
Go quickly now before they close the door
[you can give those burdens to the Lord]
That's what the altar is for"
2126;The Anchor Holds;;"I have journeyed,
Through a lone dark night
Along the open sea
By faith alone, sight unknown
And yet His eye is watching me

Chorus
The Anchor holds,
Though the ship is battered
The Anchor holds,
Though the sails are torn
I have fallen on my knees
As I faced the raging sea
But the Anchor holds
In spite of the storm

I've had visions,
And I've had dreams
And I even held them in my hands
But I never knew all those dreams
Could slip right through
Like they were only grains of sand

Well I have been young,
But I'm older now
And there has been beauty
These eyes have seen
But it was in the night,
I faced the storms of my life
But that's when
God proved His love to me"
2127;The Ancient Of Days;;"I beheld in the courts of Heaven
Where great treason was opposed:
Michael fought the great red Dragon
Who wanted to take control.
Kicked out of Heaven with the
Third of the stars,
Like lightning they fell to the earth,
They mingled the seed of men,
And by deceit, they gained control,
Until...

CHORUS
The Ancient of day
With experience, maturity and wisdom;
The Ancient of days did come,
Restoring full dominion.
The Ancient of  days did come
With experience, maturity and  wisdom
The Ancient of days did come
And we must overcome.

MONOLOGUE
I beheld this same dragon on the earth
was a dreadful beast:
He plundered and devoured,
having kings to bow at his feet.
But, I beheld till the Prince
of Princes came,
Great Michael, en morphe
As the bloody Lamb that was slain,
He brought to us the victory.
He is ....

I beheld this beast was wounded
But his deadly wound was healed:
He cast down the truth, exalted a lie,
Having the whole world to be deceived.
I beheld till a Mighty Angel came
With an open book in His hand,
He gave me skill and wisdom
To understand God

MONOLOGUE
I stood in the ranks of a great army,
They were the saints of the most high God;
We fought the dragon and overcame
By Michael"
2128;The Answer Is On The Way;;"CHORUS
The answer is on the way,
Yes I know,
Jesus said it, I believe it
And it's so;
Our heavenly Father knows our needs before we pray,
And we can rest assured the answer's on the way.

verse 1
How many times I bow beneath a heavy load,
On bended knees to God a prayer I pray
As I knelt there on the floor,
He reminds me just once more
That the answer is already on the way.

verse 2
If there's a special need within your life my friend,
And you seeking for an answer everyday;
If by faith you'll start believing
Mighty soon you'll be receiving,
For the answer is already on the way."
2129;The Battle Is On;;"Blessed are you oh Lord our God
Eternity only King
In the beginning when God thought  of man
He was perfect before Him
But He knew that man will fall
So a way was made for Him

CHORUS
Then the battle was on
The battle is on
The Lord has descended
He's come
The battle is on
The battle is on
For the day of our Lord has come

Now we can see God's plan
For His thoughts was to redeem man
The book of Daniel is now made plain
Two kings two kingdoms but one will reign
For the beast is taking his throne
But with Michael we will stand again

My peace I give to you
For you are my chosen few
Though the battles seems hard and long
By my word you will overcome
For great is our Lord
Who has fought to redeem us."
2130;The Beauty Of Jesus;;"Let the beauty of Jesus be
seen in me,
All His wonderful passion
and purity;
O Thou Spirit divine, all my
nature refine,
Till the beauty of Jesus is
seen in me."
2131;The Believer's Authority;;"Adam, the first man on earth,
Had authority over the earth;
An amateur god below,
His orders nature did follow;

""Lion come here,"" and it did,
""Wind stop!"" and it did;
Believer's authority on display!

On earth, man started with a bang!
Against him, nature could not gang;
God created not a weak man,
But a mighty authoritative man;

As long as man abides in his position,
His power is endless like an ocean,
That's the believer

He had dominion even over the serpent,
To shut its mouth in a second;
Sadly he gave in to a creature,
His dominion could not feature;

After the fall, same power was
Repeated to Noah,
Same magnitude, not any lower;
Believer's authority in continuity

Wash your blindness O church,
The vision of power do catch;
You're greater than Adam and Eve,
If on the Word you do believe;

We reign over demon power,
Victors from hour to hour!
That's the believer's authority!

We're masters of our circumstances,
Conquerors in all instances;
Instead of waking up sleeping Jesus,
Wake up your sleeping faith,

And face the elements of the earth;
""What manner of man is this?""
Should be Satan's wonder concerning you,
That's the believer's authority

We're the apple of the Lord's eye,
Loving us more than we do steak pie;
He gave us power above every power,
To rapture us high above every tower;

Demons high & below are under our feet,
Give them a running lesson, O what a fleet!
That's the believer's authority

Trouble is not a trouble,
To us, it's just a lying fable;
We wanna reduce Satan to size,
To underfeet knowing only our shoe size;

We're not ordered to pray for demons to go,
But to cast them out, negotiations no!
Yes that authority lays in us!

He didn't say if you pray for the mountain,
He said if you say to the mountain;
Be cast into the sea, and it will,
Power in our words, demons to kill;

Fear not to speak, God backs your words,
By the word He created the worlds;
Even so, our words have full authority!

We're an army of a higher category,
To invade and overtake Satan's territory;
Originality is the mystery of invincibility,
Take the Word as it is, doubt not its ability;

You can even cast demons out of yourself,
As long as God Himself is in yourself,
Say yes to the authority in you!

Who art thou great mountain?
His power overflows like a fountain;
BP, Diabetes, Cancer, HIV, Ebola,

Are all simple just like drinking CocaCola,
O friend, faith is simple like a picnic,
Simply believe even in that clinic;
You are a threat to Satan's kingdom
"
2132;The Best Way;;"The best way to have a revival
Is to pray everyday
And read your Bible
Put your feelings on the shelf
Love your neighbour as yourself
The best way to have a revival

CHORUS
Read your bible pray everyday
Pray everyday, pray every day
Read your Bible pray everyday
If you want to grow

The best way to have a revival
Is to pray everyday
And read your Bible
Put your feelings on the shelf
Love your neighbour as yourself
The best way to have a revival"
2133;The Bible Stands;;"Chorus 1
The Bible stands tho' the hills may tumble,
It will firmly stand when the earth shall crumble.
I will plant my feet on its firm foundation,
For the Bible stands, the Bible stands.

Verse 1
The Bible stands like a rock undaunted,
Mid the raging storms of time.
Its pages burn with the truth eternal,
And they glow with a light sublime.

Verse 2
The Bible stands like a mountain towering,
Far above the works of man.
Its truth by none ever was refuted,
And destroy it they never can.

Verse 3
The Bible stands, and it will forever,
When the world has passed away.
By inspiration it has been given,
All its precepts I will obey.

Verse 4
The Bible stands every test we give it,
For its Author is divine.
By grace alone I expect to live it,
And to prove it and make it mine."
2134;The Big Picture;;"Verse 1
Sometimes you wonder and you cry to the Lord,
Why I'm going through situations in my life,
I've failed to an answer for them
They just seem to overcome me,
Seems like a trail,
Test upon test;

Verse 1
And you feel so blue,
Like you are going down,
But the Lord is a man of vision,
He'll say child I know what I'm doing,
And if you knew the big picture,
And if you knew the the big picture,
You will volunteer.

Chorus
If you knew you knew the big picture,
You will volunteer for it,
For I am God, I'm sovereign,
I do what what I want with my creation,
My dear child;

Chorus
You might fail to understand it now,
But one day the picture,
Will be crystal clear in your life,
If you knew the big picture,
You will volunteer for it.

Verse 2
I've ordained your destiny path,
That's unique to yourself,
Don't compare your life with others,
I have a purpose in your life,
For you are clay in my hands;

Verse 2
Moulded according to the will of the Porter,
To come to that perfect I have in my mind,
If you only knew the expected end
I have for you;

Verse 2
And those trials you are facing,
Are just for a reason,
Just surrender yourself,
Look up to me,
I'm making you a masterpiece
For my own glory,
And if you knew the big picture,
You will volunteer in.

Bridge
Like did Job, Abraham, Joseph, Daniel,
Shadreck, Misheck, Abednego,
And the rest of the saints
That through their trials and test,
God made a bigger picture,
After the trials they were made much
stronger;

Bridge
My glory shall be right in deep dark
trials,
You're going through
My power shall be known through those
helpless trying moments;

Bridge
When you feel all hope is gone,
I shall be known in your weak times
Perfect strength by perfect weaknesses,
I'll make your test a testimony,
To prove that I am God.

And if you knew the big picture,
You will volunteer in"
2135;The Birthday Of A King;;"Chorus 1
Alleluia! O how the angels sang!
Alleluia! How it rang!
And the sky was bright with a holy light,
'Twas the birthday of a King.

Verse 1
In the little village of Bethlehem,
There lay a Child one day;
And the sky was bright with a holy light,
O'er the place where Jesus lay.

Verse 2
'Twas a humble birthplace,
But oh, how much God gave to us that day;
From the manger bed what a path has led,
What a perfect holy way.

Neither His bloody footprints,
that marked the path to His suffering.
As the nails pierced His hands and feet,
The veil was rent in two.

He saw the vision,
This blood-bought church
He saw me, he saw you.
Now we are loosed from all our bondage.
Our shackles are gone.
Death, you still have no sting.
I can still hear His blood cry,
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

CHORUS
The blood still cries freedom
From bondage and sin
You don

He wrote our names
Sealed with the blood of the spotless Lamb
Hold on to God
The blood still cries freedom

And It Dries All My Tears
The Blood That Gives Me Strength
From Day To Day
It Will Never Lose Its Power

2139;The Brazen Serpent;;"Chorus
The brazen serpent x3
Is in the camp

Verse 1
When the serpent deceived Eve in the Garden of Eden,
The brazen serpent came down to condemn the serpent,
To cover His children

Verse 2
When the children of Israel were in the wilderness,
They were bitten by fiery snakes,
But their deliverance was in the brazen serpent.

Verse 3
Today that brazen serpent appeared in the cloud of glory
I beheld His face, beard, eyes and hair

Verse 4
Even if the serpent bit I have deliverance in the brazen serpent
That brazen serpent is the Lord Jesus Christ,
The message of the hour
He is in the camp."
2140;The Breaking Of The Day;;"'Tis almost time for the Lord to come,
I hear the people say;
The stars of heav'n are growing dim:
It must be the breaking of the day.

Chorus
O, it must be the breaking of the day,
O, it must be the breaking of the day;
The night is almost gone,
The day is coming on:
O, it must be the breaking of the day.

The signs foretold in the sun and moon,
In earth and sea and sky,
Aloud proclaim to mortal men,
That the coming of the Master
draweth nigh.

It must be time for the waiting church
To cast her pride away,
With girded loins and burning lamps
To look for the breaking of the day.

There must be those in the field of sin,
Far from the fold astray,
Who once were happy in Jesus' love,
And looking for the breaking of the day.

Go quickly out in the streets and lanes,
And in the broad highway,
And call the maimed, the halt and blind,
To be ready for the breaking of the day."
2141;The Bridal Call;;"God has promised a rapture in this day,
A Bride He's preparing to take away;
But only His elected ones will go,
And we shall be with our blessed Saviour forever more.

CHORUS
So we must get our lamps trimmed and filled with oil,
Don't get your garments spotted by the things of this world;
But only watch and pray to the coming of that day,
When we shall see our blessed Saviour face to face.

O sinner please harken to His call,
For this might be the last time you hear His voice;
For this word you hear shall be heard no more,
When the bridegroom comes to take His bride away.

O Christian, don't get tied up with this world,
Keep your garments snowy white to the coming of the Lord;
For we don't have much time again,
For He shall come and He shall not tarry, tarry no more.

What a glorious day when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound;
The sleeping saints shall rise to meet the Lord,
And we who are alive and remain
Shall be caught up to meet them in the air."
2142;The Bride Of Christ Is An Odd Ball;;"verse 1
The Bride of Christ is an odd ball
She stands like a great speckled bird

She is mocked by the world and the churches
She bears the reproach of the Word

The bride groom has placed in her finger
A ring of unmerited grace
The marriage certificate has been written
And that
The marriage has already been concluded;

The Bride is going to the marriage supper

2143;The Bridge To Heaven;;"Left the splendour of His throne,
Came down to earth,
Had one purpose in His mind.
Tempted in all points as we are
Yet without sin,
Most worthy High Priest,
He's the Supreme Sacrifice.

CHORUS
He is the bridge from Earth to Heaven, X2
We now live in God's presence forever.

I'll always look to Calvary where
Redemption price was paid for me,
There on the cross, crucified with
Him.
There on the cross I was in Him,
There on the cross I paid for my sin,
And His glory, I now boldly enter in.

Lift your eyes to Calvary,
see where He has set you free,
Loosed from the grips of sin and shame.
Sin has no more dominion over you,
You're ordained to do just what you do,
He's that bridge to Heaven for me and you.

To the splendour of His throne,
His Bride now leaves the Earth,
Quickening power now breaks the hold of time;
Travelling faster than the speed of light,
We'll be changed in the twinkling of an eye,
And that bridge to Heaven will be no more"
2144;The Church's One Foundation;;"The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord:
She is His new creation
By water and the Word.
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth,
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their watch are keeping
Their cry goes up, ""How long?""
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song.

Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore.
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the church at rest."
2145;The Circuit Rider;;"The circuit rider preacher went
riding through the land
With a rifle on his shoulder and
a Bible in his hand
He told the praire people of a
blessed Promised land
As he went riding, singing along

Leaning, leaning
Leaning on the everlasting arm
Leaning, leaning
Leaning on the everlasting arm

He preached the coming
judgment of fire and brimstone
And a glorious endless Heaven
of the justified alone
As he rode across the mountains
you could hear him sing this song



There is power, power, wonder
working power
In the blood of the lamb
There is power, power, wonder
working power
In the precious blood of the lamb.

His rifle is old and rusty and
hanging on the wall
His Bible's worn and dusty and its'
seldom touched at all;
But his Message from this Bible
will meet us at Judgment Day
For God's truth keeps marching on.

Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His truth is marching on

Daar is krag krag wonderbare
Krag in die dierbare bloed van die Lam"
2146;The Cleansing Wave;;"Oh! now I see the crimson wave,
The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save
Points to His wounded side.

CHORUS
The cleansing stream, I see, I see!
I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me!
Oh! praise the Lord, it cleanseth me,
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me!

I see the new creation rise,
I hear the speaking blood,
It speaks! polluted nature dies!
Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.

I rise to walk in heav'n's own light
Above the world and sin,
With heart made pure, and
garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

Amazing grace! 'tis heav'n below
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus know,
My Jesus crucified."
2147;The Cloud And Fire;;"As of old, when the hosts  of Israel
Were compelled in the  wilderness
to dwell,
Trusting they in their God
to lead the way
To the light of perfect day.

CHORUS
So the sign of the fire by night,
And the sign of the cloud by day,
Hovering o'er, just before,
As they journey on their way,
Shall a guide and a leader be,
Till the wilderness be past,
For the Lord, our God, in His
own good time
Shall lead to the light at last.

To and fro, as a ship without
a sail,
Not a compass to guide them
through the vale,
But the sign of their God was
ever near,
Thus their fainting hearts
to cheer.

All the days of their wanderings
they were fed,
To the land of the promise they
were led;
By the hand of the Lord in
guidance sure,
They were brought to Canaan's
shore."
2148;The Cloud Of Glory;;"The Cloud of Glory is moving
Move with the Cloud

In His own image, formed from His own hand,
Satan, Oh satan, tempted man to fall;

2152;The Day He Wore My Crown;;"The City was Jerusalem;
The time was long ago;
The people called Him Jesus,
The crime was the love He showed.
And I'm the one to blame;
I caused all the pain.
He gave Himself the day He wore my crown.

He brought me love that only He could give;
I brought Him cause to cry.
And though He taught me how to live,
I taught Him how to die.
And I'm the one to blame,
I caused all the pain.
He gave Himself the day He wore my crown.

CHORUS
He could have called His Holy Father and said,
""Take me away,  please,  take me away.""
He could have said,
""I'm not guilty and
I'm not gonna stay,
I'm not gonna pay.""

But He walked right through the gate;
And then on up the hill.
And as He fell beneath the weight
He cried, ""Father not my will.""
Still I'm the one to blame,
I caused all the pain.
He gave Himself the day He wore my crown."
2153;The Day Of Redemption;;"Nations are breaking,
Israel's awaking,
The signs that the prophets
foretold;
The Gentile days numbered,
With horrors encumbered;
Eternity soon will unfold.

CHORUS
The day of redemption is near,
Men's hearts are failing for fear;
Be filled with the Spirit,
Your lamps trimmed and clear,
Look up! Your redemption is here.

The fig tree is growing;
Jerusalem's restoring
Her national life, long dethroned;
Today she is calling,
Her latter rain's falling,
""Return, Oh dispersed, to your own.""

Heaven's powers are shaking,
And many are mistaking
God's meaning to be of the sky;
God's Church is the power
That's shaking this hour:
The day of redemption is nigh.

False prophets are lying,
God's Truth they're denying,
That Jesus the Christ is our God;
Though this generation
Spurns God's revelation,
We'll walk where the apostles
have trod."
2154;The Decision Is Yours To Make;;"I have heard about some people
They're  written of in the bible
God promised them a land beyond the Jordan
But some had their own ideas
They were thinking of their own affairs
At the borderline they settled down

CHORUS
But where do you choose to live
What benefits does it have to give
Is it an  investment in eternal life
Or keeps you at the border line
The decision is yours to make

We can have lots of fancy things
We can live close to earthly kings
Like Lot you can be famous   in Sodom
Just remember there'll come a time
When those thing won't be worth a dime
When the fire falls it will all be burnt up

Friends if we want a deeper life
We got to make a greater sacrifice
We have to be more sincere
This would mean a lot of shaking down
But we really have to move on
By grace alone we'll make it there"
2155;The Deed That Came;;"Verse 1
This is what we have been taught
By the prophet of God today.

Let us lift our voices together and shout,
Hallelujah! to our God
Who has redeemed us by His blood,
The Deed that came.

Verse 2
This great mystery that was sealed
In our day has been made so real.
'Twas the abstract title deed,
The promise God made to Abraham's seed;

Verse 2
Seven deaths and seven steps,
That the Christ may be formed in me,
The Deed that came.

Verse 3
This dominion that Adam lost,
In our day has been displayed;
By a simple, humble man;
One who stood true to God's great plan;

Verse 3
And from flesh to Word he came,
Spoke a word and squirrels came,
The Deed that came."

I may be sick but I'll keep on believing
I know that I'll be healed in Jesus name
The devil tries to rob me from my inheritance

Verse 1
And the blessing the Lord has promised
I looked at my lying vanities and said
I'm going to walk into my victory.

CHORUS 1
The Dove flew into my heart
I know that He did,
He has led me through the storms
I firmly believe
The Lord has raised me up so high

Chorus
To believe what He has done for me
I'm an eagle to soar above the troubled waters;
He has fluttered His wings in my heart
The Dove flew into my heart I firmly believe
The Dove flew into my heart I know that He did.

Verse 2
I may be troubled, confused and shattered
I may be scarred but I'll never give up
He has promised deliverance from all my bondage

Verse 2
He wouldn't deny what He has promised
Jesus has provided all my needs
Whenever I call on His name."

If you hasten off to glory,
Linger near the Eastern Gate.,
For I'm coming in the morning,
So you'll not have long to wait.

sorrowing picture,

CHORUS
The end is here,

The Bride is gathering;

Was to certain poor shepherds,
In fields as they lay;
In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east,
Beyond them far,
And to the earth
It gave great light,
And so it continued
Both day and night.

Three wise men came
From country far;
To seek for a King
Was their intent,
And to follow the star,
Wherever it went.

To the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem
It took its rest,
And there it did
Both stop and stay,
Right over the place
Where Jesus lay.

Full rev'rently
Upon their knee,
And offered there
In His presence,
Their gold, and myrrh,
And frankincense.

And earth of naught,

He by Himself hath sworn,
I on His oath depend;
I shall on eagles wings upborne,
To heaven ascend.
I shall behold His face,
I shall His power adore;
And sing the wonders
Of His grace forevermore.

Verse 4
The whole triumphant host,
Give thanks to God on high;
""Hail, Father, Son and Holy Ghost!""
They ever cry.
Hail, Abraham's God and mine!
I join the heavenly lays,
All might and majesty are Thine;
And endless praise.
Amen."
2169;The God Of The Mountain;;"Life is easy, when youre up on the mountain
And youve got peace of mind, like youve never known
But things change, when youre down in the valley
Dont lose faith, for your never alone

Chorus
For the God on the mountain, is still God in the valley
When things go wrong, he'll make them right
And the God of the good times, is still God in the bad times
The God of the day, is still God in the night.

We talk of faith way up on the mountain
But talk comes easy, when lifes at its best
Now its down in the valleys, trials and temptations
Thats where your faith is really put to the test

For the God on the mountain, is still God in the valley,
When things go wrong, he'll make them right
And the God of the good times, is still God in the bad times
The God of the day, is still God in the night
The God of the day, is still God in the night"
2170;The God Of This Evil Age;;"The God of this evil age,
Has blinded their eyes today,
A people who walk their
own way
Not according to God's Word.
They're denying the things
He's done,
Rejecting His only Son,
And accepting the creeds of man;
Oh, this is the evening time.

CHORUS
This is the evening time,
It's later than you think;
The Bride is preparing now,
For her Lord to meet.
All things are ready now,
The combine is here.
He that hath an ear to hear,
The evening time is here.

Gross darkness throughout the land,
And people can't understand,
God's prophet has warned the land
Proclaiming the Word to men;
So if you'll be saved today,
Just follow that way He gave,
That's accepting the Word of God
Oh, this is the evening time.

Seven thunders they don't believe,
How else could the Seals be
revealed
To give the Bride rapturing faith,
Sleeping saints and our Lord to meet.
If you want to be raptured today,
Follow Ephesians 0:11's way,
It's the anointed Word today,
Oh, this is the evening time."
2171;The Goodness Of Jesus;;"When I think of the goodness of Jesus,
And all He has done for me.
Then my soul cries out, ""Hallelujah,
Praise God for saving me."""
2172;The Gospel Train;;"Chorus 1
Oh I'm trav'ling on the hallelujah line,
On the good old gospel train.
I am on the right track,
And never will go back
To the station of sin again.
I am trav'ling on the hallelujah line,
On the good old gospel train.
I need no fare, I'm riding on a pass,
'Tis the blood for sinners slain."
2173;The Grass Is Greener;;"Well I watched a hand today
Reach out to a loved one,
And it nearly broke my heart to say good-bye
When I heard my brother say that He was leaving,
I've been waiting, oh so long, for God's chariot to take me home
Where the grass is greener on the other side,
Where the grass is greener on the other side.

CHORUS
Where the roses never ever die,
God's river never runs dry,
Children play forever on the hills of freedom;
No more war, no more pain,
No more parting ever again,
The grass is greener on the other side,
Where the grass is greener on the other side.

Oh, this earth with all of its beauty holds so little,
And if I could leave today, I'll be satisfied.
Well I hope that you won't think that I'm ungrateful,
But my heart is set on glory,
And my mind is fixed on glory,
Where the grass is greener on the other side,
Where the grass is greener on the other side."
2174;The Great Emancipator;;"Once my heart and soul were fettered
By the binding chains of sin,
But the Great Emancipator
Set me free to worship Him.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Blessed be His holy name!
He's the Great Emancipator,
That's the song of the Redeemed!

Like a lost lamb I was drifting
Oh so helpless and alone,
But the seeking Shepherd found me,
Led me to my Father's home."
2175;The Great Exodus;;"Verse 1
The Lord has called  a great
Exodus in this evil day,
For He has promised in His Word ,
That a people must be changed
And taken away;

Verse 1
Once again the Token
Is required of every man,
As the death angel moves
Swiftly throughout the land;

Verse 1
For the plagues of Egypt
Are throughout the land,
Gross darkness on the people,
They don't understand
(We are living in the time of
mercy and judgement.)x2

Verse 2
The mystery Cloud has shown
The Supreme Judge in our day,
He'll judge and make war
With evil Scientists
Who have despised His way;

Verse 2
They are corrupting
And destroying the earth
With Satan's wisdom,
They've made it a time bomb
Activated for sure destruction;

Verse 2
But rejoice you saints who sigh and cry,
The Cloud has brought our redemption nigh;
(You shall leap over walls
into a new dimension) x 2

Verse 3
Volcanic lava shall spew forth
From the centre of the earth,
A regeneration to a new civilization,
This earth shall give birth;

Verse 3
But like Noah,
We shall be lifted
Above the judgements again,
When fire and hailstones fall
From the skies like rain;

Verse 3
For on the ashes of the wicked
Shall the righteous stand,
The meek of the earth
Shall inherit the land;
(Oh rejoice ye citizens of new  Jerusalem.)

Verse 4
Your tormentors and oppressors
You shall see them no more,
For the Holy Fire of God's wrath
Shall make your exodus sure;

Verse 4
No more demons to disrupt
And pollute our atmosphere,
God will purge the earth;
The rivers of water
Shall be crystal clear;

Verse 4
Edenic beauty shall cover the earth again,
No more sickness, no more sorrows,
No more pain;
(God and man, heaven and
will be one again.)"
2176;The Great Healer;;"On the Cross crucified, in great sorrow He died;
The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised and rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary.

CHORUS
He was wounded for our
transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid,
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgement hall,
Now His suffering affords perfect healing for all,
This wonderful Healer's mine.

Came the leper to Christ, saying ""Surely I know,
That Thou, Lord, can'st make me whole.""
When His great faith was seen,
Jesus said, ""Yes I will'""
And touched him and made him clean.

He has healed my sick soul,
Made me every whit whole,
And He'll do the same for you.
He's the same yesterday and today and forever,
This Healer of men today."
2177;The Great I Am;;"I AM that spoke to Moses in
the burning bush of fire
I AM the God of Abraham, the
Bright and Morning Star.
I AM the Rose of Sharon, from
beginning whence I came;
I AM the whole creation, and
Jesus is My Name.

CHORUS
Oh, who do you say I am,
and whence do you say I came,
Do you know the Father,
and can you tell His Name?
In Jesus dwells the fullness
of the Godhead, don't you see;
Jesus is the great I AM,
and the Lord of lords is He.

I AM was before old Abraham,
""He rejoiced to see MY day."" .
When Jesus spoke these
precious  words, they stoned
Him right away.
""Why do you stone Me?"" Jesus
said, in a holy, sweet command.
""Because you say you're the
great I AM, we believe you're
just a man

It was on the Day of Pentecost,
oh, how the fire did fall;
The Holy Ghost descended
and filled them one and all.
Then Peter told the multitude,
""Repent of all your sins.""
About three thousand souls
were buried in Jesus'
precious Name."
2178;The Great Judgement Morning;;"I dreamed that the great judgement
morning.
Had dawned and the trumpet had blown
I dreamed that the nations were gathered
To judgement before the white throne
From the throne came a bright shining
angel
And stood on the land and the sea
And swore with his hand raised to heaven
That time was no longer to be.

Chorus
And O, what a weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate
They cried to the rocks and the mountains
They prayed but their prayers were too late

The rich man was there but his money
Had melted and vanished away;
A pauper he stood in the judgement,
His debts were too heavy to pay;
The great man was there but his greatness
When death came was left far behind
The angel that opened the records,
Not a trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there and the orphans,
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven for ever,
God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
The gambler was there and the drunkard ,
And the man that had sold them the drink
With the people who gave them the license.
Together in hell they did sink.

The moral man came to the judgement
But his self-righteous rags would not do;
The men who had crucified Jesus
Had passed off as the moral men, too;
The soul that had put off salvation,
""Not tonight; I'll get saved by and by,
No time now to think of religion
At last they had found time to die"
2179;The Great Physician;;"Verse 1
The great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus.
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer.
O hear the voice of Jesus!

Chorus 1
Sweetest note
in seraph song,
Sweetest name
on mortal tongue,
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

Verse 2
Your many sins
are all forgiven,
O hear the voice of Jesus!
Go on your way,
In peace to heaven,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

Verse 3
All glory to
the dying Lamb,
I now believe in Jesus.
I love the blessed Savior's name;
I love the name of Jesus.

Verse 4
His name dispels
my guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus;
O how my soul
delights to hear
The charming name
of Jesus"

2183;The Greatest Love Story;;"verse 1
I left a barren land
Searching for rest,
Stumbling 'round in amnesia,
Bitterness and distress

Verse 1
But then I met the Kinsman Redeemer
Who is called the Mighty One,
He took this old Moabite from the field
To bring me to His house.

Chorus
He said fear not my child
For you are part of me,
And I'll not rest
Till you are at my side;

Chorus
I will do all that you ask of Me
You're a jewel in my eyes,
Virtuous woman,
You are my Bride.

verse 2
I have responded to your call
And You've covered me,
With eyes of faith I see
All the mysteries being revealed;

Verse 2
And now I see who I am
I make claim to all that's mine,
I am the Lamb's wife
I was bought with a price.

verse 3
When I look back and see
How much grace and love
You showed me,
Lord it brings me to my knees
That You can even think about me;

Verse 3
When I am in need
You are still Jehovah Jireh
Jehovah Rapha
You are still the Great Healer
With faith I'll stand on Your word
Because You are more than able.

I woke up this morning,
wondering could this be the day
When those who beneath us are resting,
Would arise to bring on that new day;

Then my heart began to beat for joy
knowing what day that would be
For the Bride will go to meet Jesus,

2185;The Hallelujah Side;;"Once a sinner far from Jesus,
I was perishing with cold,
But the blessed Savior
Heard me when I cried;
Then He threw His robe around me,
And He led me to His fold,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

CHORUS
Oh, glory be to Jesus,
Let the hallelujahs roll;
Help me ring the Savior's praises
far and wide,
For I've opened up tow'rd heaven
All the windows of my soul,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Tho' the world may sweep around me
With her dazzle and her dreams,
Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,
For my soul looks up to heaven
Where the golden sunlight gleams,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Not for all earth's golden millions
Would I leave this precious place,
Tho' the tempter to persuade me
oft has tried,
For I'm safe in God's pavilion,
Happy in His love and grace,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

Here the sun is always shining,
Here the sky is always bright;
'Tis no place for gloomy
Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music
And my heart with great delight,
And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

And upon the streets of Glory,
When we reach the other shore,
And have safely crossed the Jordan's
rolling tide,
You will find me shouting ""Glory""
Just outside my mansion door,
Where I'm living on the hallelujah side."
2186;The Haven Of Rest;;"My soul in sad exile
Was out on life's sea,
So burdened with sin
and distressed,
Till I heard a sweet voice
Saying, ""Make me your choice;""
And I entered the Haven of Rest.

CHORUS
I've anchored my soul
In the Haven of Rest,
I'll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep
O'er the wild, stormy deep;
In Jesus I'm safe evermore.

I yielded myself
To his tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off,
And I anchored my soul;
The Haven of Rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul,
Since the Lord made me whole,
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus who'll save
Whosoever will have
A home in the Haven of Rest.

How precious the thought
That we all may recline,
Like John the beloved and blest,
On Jesus' strong arm
Where no tempest can harm,
Secure in the Haven of Rest.

Oh come to the Savior,
He patiently waits,
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul
In the Haven of Rest,
And say, ""My Beloved is mine."""

Yet my Lord was despised and rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary.

Chorus

He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid,

Oh, there's peace and rest and love,
Where the healing waters flow!

Now with Jesus crucified,
At his feet I'm resting low;
Let me evermore abide
Where the healing waters flow.

Oh, this precious perfect love!
How it keeps the heart aglow,
Streaming from the fount above,
Where the healing waters flow.

Oh, to lean on Jesus' breast,
While the tempests come and go!
Here is blessed peace and rest,
Where the healing waters flow.

Cleansed from ev'ry sin and stain,
Whiter than the driven snow,
Now I sing my sweet refrain,
Where the healing waters flow."

Oh, the depth of the knowledge
And the wisdom of the Lord!
His judgements are unsearchable,
And His ways past finding out;

Verse 1
Who hath directed His Spirit?
And whose counsel did He take?
For by Him and through Him
Are all things on earth made.

CHORUS
And we know that all things work together for our good,
The footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord;
Even though things don't work out
The way we think they should,
Yet we know in all things,
That the heavens surely rule.

Verse 2
Which of us by taking thought could add to ourselves?
Why do we yet so many times resist His will?
We've got to realize salvation is wholly of the Lord;
Just stand still and consider
All the wondrous works of God.

Verse 3
There is nothing that happens
without a real intent,
Our experiences were ordained,
Our trials have been set

Verse 3
That we might manifest the purpose
Unto which we have been called,
So in perfect confidence
We can submit to Him our all."

We bring the praises back to You.

Chorus
We exalt You God Almighty;
You are worthy to be praised,
Let all nations bow before You;

Where the enemy is running with
Confusion all about,

Raise them high, His Word is true;

We bring the praise back to You.

2192;The Homecoming Week;;"Upon our journey here below
we meet with pain and loss;
Sometimes there is a crown of thorns,
sometimes the heavy cross.
The dreary road to Calvary,
the bitter goad and sting,
But what's inside those gates of pearl
will be worth everything.

CHORUS
When we're inside the gates of pearl,
We'll learn a lot of things,
We'll have a harp that's made of gold,
Perhaps a thousand strings;
We'll sing and shout and dance about,
The Lamb will dry our tears;
We'll have a grand homecoming week,
The first ten thousand years.

The shadows now begin to fall,
the time is drawing nigh,
When Christ our Lord shall come again
like lightning from the sky.
And while we wait and suffer here,
praise God, we'll shout and sing,
For one glimpse through those gates
of pearl will be worth everything.

The precious blood of God's own Son
has saved and sanctified
A wondrous people for His name
and they are called the Bride.
Though here neglected and despised,
one day the Lord will bring
His chosen ones within the gates,
and that's worth everything."
2193;The Honest In Heart;;"The first pull contacted the flesh of men,
But did not reach the soul

And the third went back for them
He's promised a second ride
And has returned to prove His word
He's here with us who're honest in heart.x2

chorus
He's going back for the honest in heart
Who laid down their lives within the sacrifice
He's going back for the honest in heart
Going back for the honest in heart

By faith Rahab the harlot
Perished not with all the rest
She received the spies with peace
And she was blessed
The token was applied
And even though the walls fell down
(The spies went back for her)
(She was saved) she was honest in her heart.x2

On His way to Jerusalem
He picked up the ones and twos
Blind man Bartemaeus
And little Zacchaeus too
We've seen Him repeated in the bride
As she moves on
He's seeking out all the honest in their heart x2

Our lord so rich in mercy
Even there upon the cross
Love burned deep within His heart
To reach out for the lost
The thief hung at His side
Humbly asked to be remembered
And in that hour He reached out for an honest one.

Even way down in South Africa
As we've heard it testified
How the Lord worked things out
He never forgets his own
No matter what condition
He kept His word
He reached out for the honest in the heart x2"

And home rejoicing brought me.

In death's dark vale I'll fear no ill,

Enoch seven steps to the King's chamber
Oh what a language it is to us in this hour

Arise my people and see this reality
Under one headship, one language
In this evening time.

What a language it is from the dust to the stars above

give to me
When He shall appear
So when He comes He'll find me
waiting here
So here I stand

before
I cross over on the other side
From here I see the new world
The new Jerusalem
Someday soon I'll cross the great
divide
Someday soon I'll be on the other
side

verse 2
I've been battle scared, been
through many wars
But they have only made me
strong
So I'll keep fighting on
In the midst of all adversity I've
stood victoriously It is God's grace
that gives me victory
So here I stand

Feeling that strange call of God
I know it's time to leave
Calling me to my Father's house
Things that are to be
I see the setting sun
I know I'll find what I'm looking for
From where I stand
I'll walk through the open door"

2202;The Lifeboat;;"We're floating down the stream of time,
We have not long to stay;
The stormy clouds of darkness
Will turn to brightest day.

For we're not left alone;
The lifeboat soon is coming
To gather the Jewels home.

Chorus
Then cheer, my brother, cheer,
Our trials will soon be o'er,
Our loved ones we shall meet, shall meet,
Upon the golden shore.
We're pilgrims and we're strangers here,
We're seeking a city to come,
The lifeboat soon is coming,
To gather the Jewels home.

Sometimes the Devil tempts me,
And says it's all in vain
To try to live a Christian life
And walk in Jesus' name;
But then we hear the Master say,
""I'll lend you a helping hand,
And if you'll only trletust Me,
I'll guide you to the land.""

The lifeboat soon is coming,
By eyes of faith I see
As she sweeps through the waters
To rescue you and me,
And land us safely in the port
With friends we love so dear.
""Get ready,"" cries the Captain;
""Oh, look, she's almost here.""

Oh, now's the time to get on board,
While she is passing by;
But if you stand and wait too long,
You shall forever die;
The fare is paid for one and all,
The Captain bids you come,
And get on board the lifeboat,
She'll carry you safely home."
2203;The Lighthouse;;"Verse 1
There's a lighthouse on the hillside,
That overlooks life's sea;
When I'm tossed it sends out a
light,
That I might see;
And the light that shines in darkness now,
Will safely lead me o'er;
If it wasn't for that lighthouse
My ship would sail no more.

Verse 1
Everybody that lives around us,
Says tear that old lighthouse down,
The big ships don't sail this way anymore,
There's no use of it standing round
But then my mind goes back to that stormy night,
When just in time, I saw  the Light,
Yes, the Light from that old Lighthouse
That's stands up there on the hill.

CHORUS
I thank God for the Lighthouse,
I owe my life to Him;
Jesus is the Lighthouse,
And from the rocks of sin
He has shone the Light around me,
That I could clearly see;
If it wasn't for that Lighthouse
Tell me where would this ship be.

Bridge
Everybody that lives around us,
Says tear that old lighthouse down,
The big ships don't sail this way anymore,

But then my mind goes back to that stormy night,
When just in time, I saw  the Light,
Yes, the Light from that old Lighthouse
That's stands up there on the hill."

All I need to cleanse
And make me fully whole.

Verse1
In sorrow He's my comfort,
In trouble He's my stay
He tells me every care
On Him to roll.

CHORUS
He's the Lily of the Valley,
The bright and morning star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand
to my soul.

Verse2
He all my grief has taken,
And all my sorrows borne;
In temptation He's my
Strong and mighty tower;
I have all for Him forsaken,
And all my idols torn from my heart,
And now He keeps me by His power.

Verse2
Though all the world forsake me,
And Satan tempts me sore,
Through Jesus I shall
Safely reach the goal;

Verse3
He will never, never leave me,
Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith
And do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me,
I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He
My hungry soul shall fill.

Verse3
Then sweeping up to glory,
To see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll!"
2205;The Lion Hath Prevailed;;"John could see the elders, gathered round the throne
He saw a book in His right hand closed and unknown
It held the names and redemption claims of every child of God
If no one came to take the book creation would be lost.

Then suddenly and elder said, there is a worthy one
A lion and a bloody lamb He prevailed and won
He came and took this wondrous book and He tore the seals away
and everyone bowed down and sang with voices filled with praise

Let us worship for the lion hath prevailed
The book with our inheritance has been opened and unveiled
Hallelujah give Him glory satan's plans have failed
Because the Lion hath prevailed.

He has made us kings and priests and redeemed us by His grace
We shall rule and Reign."

Whom shall I fear?

When the wicked even my enemies
Came upon me, they stumbled
And fell.

Chorus
For by my God I can run through
A troop of death;
I've  leapt over a wall Into higher realms;
I have conquered all the gates of hell.
It's through faith;
All these things I have done
By my God.

In the time of trouble
In His Pavilion I'll hide;

In the secret of His Tabernacle
Is where I'll abide.
When all host should encamp against me;
My heart shall not fear The walls shall rise."

In the presence of my enemies

The Lord will make a way somehow
When beneath the cross I bow
He will take away each sorrow
Let Him have your burdens now

When the load sows down so heavy
The weight is thrown upon my brow

But when I try to do the right thing
Evil is present on every hand

I look up and wonder why
Good fortune will soon pass me by
But I say to myself,
The Lord will make a way somehow

Verse 3
Often there
About the good I do
I go to friends for consolation
I find them complaining too

Oh at night I toss in pain
Wondering what the day will bring

2215;The Love Of God;;"verse 1
The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell;

verse 1
The guilty pair,
bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.

CHORUS
Oh, love of God,
how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall
forevermore endure,
The saints
and angels song.

verse 2
When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;


verse 2
God's love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race,
The saints and angels' song.

verse 3
Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;

To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky."

You have heard of little Moses in the bulrush,
You have heard of fearless David and his sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming
Joseph,

Verse1

There are many, many others through the Bible,
I should like to meet them all, I do declare!
By and by the Lord will surely let us meet them,
At the meeting in the air.

There is going to be a meeting in the air.
In the sweet, sweet by and by;

In that home beyond the sky;

Chorus2
Such singing you will hear,
Never heard by mortal ear,
'Twill be glorious, I do declare!
And God's own Son will be the leading One
At the meeting in the air.

Verse2
Many things will there be missing
In that meeting:
For the mourners bench
Will have no place at all;
There will never be a sermon
Preached to sinners,

Verse2
For the sinner had refused to heed the call.
There will be no mourning
Over wayward loved ones,
There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer;
All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted
At that meeting in the air.

Verse3
There the doubters will be missing altogether,
All the skeptics will be absent on that day;
There will be no grumblers present to disturb us,
And the Achans will be busy far away.

Verse3
There the saints will have His
""Seal upon their foreheads,""
Dressed in raiment none
But ransomed ones can wear;
All who have the wedding garments
will be present,
At the meeting in the air."

Coming back to earth

To go and reign with Christ

Gladly may we herald the message
Of His blessed appearing,
Soon He's coming in glory,
Tell to one and all;
Then awake, ye saints of the Lord,
Why slumber when the end is nearing,
But get ready for the final call.

We're longing for the glory
that awaits the faithful,
Who shall overcome,
and ev'ry conflict win;
Press ever bravely onward,
the prize is life eternal
To all who win the fight over sin.

We're praying for the advent
of our blessed Savior,
Who has promised life
to all who trust His grace;
His coming now is pending,
the message being given,
And soon we'll see our Lord
face to face.

We see the signs appearing
of His blessed coming,
Lo, behold the fig leaves
now becoming green;
The gospel of His kingdom
has gone to ev'ry nation;
That we are near the end
can be seen."

chorus
To whom shall we
Lord there is no one that I know
That can satisfy this longing deep within
For there is nothing in this life
In this world of toils and strive
So to whom shall we go
There is no one I know but you

This mighty King has spoken again
Through the seventh angle's voice
That we might hear the word of God
And by hearing make a choice
Where we stand for God and
Right away will go astray

Will you also go."

of investigation judgement,
The wrath of God  has been

Soon the righteous shall walk
on the ashes of wicked men.

CHORUS
For they with wicked hands
have crucified
The Most Holy One In a
most cruel way
They have rejected the greatest light
That has ever shone since creation.

Men's hearts are failing,
failing for fear
Seeing that coming destruction
is drawing near,
They have sinned and sinned
away their day of grace;
Loving their religious works
more than the Revealed Word.

For this world has been
indicted and put on trial,
And have become souls in prison."

2231;The Night Vision;;"I beheld in the night vision,
O'er the great sea of humanity,
Creeping things, detestable things,
Rising and gathering around me;
From my soul came a desperate cry,

I want to live with You eternally!'

CHORUS
I cried, ""Hide me Rock of ages,
Separate me from the evils of this life,
Cover me with Thy robe of purity,
Be Lord of my life.""

Then I lifted my eyes towards Heaven,
Lo, a Mighty Angel came down;
One foot on land and one upon sea,
And His face shone like the sun;
When He spoke His voice was like thunder,
And a mystery was made clear;
For the Voice that thundered judgement
Whispered freedom in my ear.

I considered the voice of the Angel,
Whose sayings were faithful and true,
Saying, ""I Jesus is the Word of God
That has come to redeem you;
Through the Angel in the pulpit,
Cause this man to understand
He would live and reign eternally.""

I cried, ""Thank Thee, Rock of ages,
You've separated me from the evils of this life,
You have covered me with Thy robe of purity,
You are Lord of my life.""

I was lifted amidst a great multitude
In the air above the sea,
A new song they sang no man could learn,
Shouting praise for victory;
Saying, ""Worthy is the Lamb,
Who has given us power to overcome,
We now live and we'll reign eternally.""

I heard a great voice saying, ""Come up hither,
To the great supper of the Lamb
Prepared by God for those whom He foreknew
Before the world began,
Saying, ""Enter the joys of the Lord
My beloved Bride,
Come sit with Me,
I just want you at My side."""

She
But that

The Bridegroom has placed in her finger
A ring of unmerited grace
The marriage certificate has been written
And that

The marriage has already been conducted

Has joined the Bride to the Bridegroom

2233;The Old Account Settled;;"There was a time on earth,
When in the book of heaven
An old account was standing
For sins yet unforgiven;
My name was at the top,
And many things below,
I went unto the keeper,
And settled long ago.

CHORUS
Long ago, long ago,
Yes the old account
Was settled long ago;
And the record's clear today,
For He washed my sins away,
When the old account
Was settled long ago.

The old account was large,
And growing every day,
For I was always sinning,
And never tried to pay;
But when I looked ahead,
And saw such pain and woe,
I said that I would settle,
I settled long ago.

When at the judgment bar,
I stand before my King,
And He the book will open,
He cannot find a thing;
Then will my heart be glad,
While tears of joy will flow
Because I had it settled,
And settled long ago.

When in that happy home,
My Savior's home above,
I'll sing redemption's story,
And praise Him for His love;
I'll not forget that book,
With pages white as snow,
Because I came and settled,
And settled long ago.

O sinner, seek the Lord,
Repent of all your sin,
For thus He hath commanded,
If you would enter in;
And then if you should live
A hundred years below,
Up there you'll not regret it,
You settled long ago."
2234;The Old Fashioned Meeting;;"Oh, how well I remember in the
old-fashioned days,
When some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned ways;
In the old-fashioned meetings, as they tarried there,
In the old-fashioned manner,
How God answered their prayer.

CHORUS
'Twas an old-fashioned meeting, in an old-fashioned place,
Where some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace:
As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray,
And God heard me, and saved me in the old-fashioned way.

There was singing, such singing of those old-fashioned airs!
There was power, such power in those old-fashioned prayers,
An old-fashioned conviction made the sinner pray,
And the Lord heard and saved him,
In the old-fashioned way.

Well, they say it is better, ""Things have changed don't you
And the people in general, seem to think it is so;
And they call me old-fashioned when I dare to say,
That I like it far better in the
old-fashioned way.

If the Lord never changes, as the fashions of men,
If He's always the same, why,
He is old-fashioned then!
As an old-fashioned sinner saved thro' old time grace,
Oh, I'm sure He will take me to an
old-fashioned place."
2235;The Old Rugged Cross;;"Chorus 1
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

On a hill far away
Stood an old rugged cross;
The emblem of suffering and shame.
And I love that old cross
Where the dearest and best,
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Verse 2
Oh, that old rugged cross,
So despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God,
Left His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.

Verse 3
In the old rugged cross,
Stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For 'twas on that old cross,
Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

Verse 4
To the old rugged cross
I will ever be true,
It's shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day
To my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share."

2240;The Peace Of God;;"Verse 1
There's a peace to know
That you are saved,
And that all your sins are washed away;
But then there's a peace that passeth all understanding,
A peace that cannot easily be disturbed.

CHORUS
For it's good to know you're justified,
Your sins are under the blood;
It's good to know you cannot be lost
Under no circumstance,
But when the perils of this life
Befall you everyday;
There's peace with God,
But most of all you need
The peace of God.

Verse 2
The Father comes and shows you your standing,
And that all you have ever done wrong
He doesn't remember;
But to face your everyday trials you need something
That will give you settled peace
And cause worrying to cease.

Verse 3
The Father comes and shows you your standing
And that your sins were placed in the sea of forgetfulness;
But sight and time being your worst enemies,
Breed fear and sometimes insecurity."

I want my lips to praise You
With my final breath."
2242;The Pearly White City;;"There's a holy and beautiful city,
Whose builder and ruler is God.

When Patmos, in exile, he trod;
Its high, massive wall is of jasper,
The City itself is pure gold;
And when my frail tent here is folded,
Mine eyes shall its glory behold.

chorus
In that bright city', pearly white city,
I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown;
Now I am watching, waiting and longing,
For the white city John saw coming down.

No sin is allowed in that city,
And nothing defiling nor mean;
No pain and no sickness can enter,
No crape on the doorknob is seen;
Earth's sorrows and cares are forgotten,
No tempter is there to annoy;
No parting words ever are spoken,
There's nothing to hurt and destroy.

No heartaches are known in that city,
No tears ever moisten the eye,
There's no disappointment in heaven,
No envy and strife in the sky;
The saints are all sanctified wholly,
They live in sweet harmony there;
My heart is now set on that city,
And some day its blessings I'll share.

My loved ones are gathering yonder,
My friends, too, are passing away;
And soon I shall join their bright number,
And dwell in eternity's day;
They're safe now in glory with Jesus,
Their trials and battles are past;
They overcome sin and the tempter,
They've reached that fair city at last."

We pledge that we will stand,

Eagles high in flight,
Soaring towards the heavens above,
We'll lay down our lives
As Jesus did in love."

So it might seem to the natural mind;
But don't you know my friend,
Great things happen in silence;
Have you ever heard the sun rise?
Have you ever seen the flower grow?
And in this half an hour silence,
There are people becoming the Word.

CHORUS
Many are changing from
glory unto glory,
Hearts are being raptured
up into glory;
People walking holy unto
the Lord,
It won't be long and we'll
be gone.

God's great mystery's been unfolding
In such a silent way,
He hid it from the wise and prudent,
Revealed it to babes;
Why don't you look in and see
God in simplicity?
Christ is unveiled before our eyes, Can't you see?

Let's search our lives my brothers,
This is a treacherous hour;
Search your lives my sisters,
It's not easy to be left back in this hour"

In our earth made by man,
And know ye not
The kingdom of our Lord is in you,
For this stone did not only smite
But grew into a mountain too

Then the Son of man
Came with a prophecy,
And out of his mouth
Came seven thundering voices,
To quicken and bring to life
This scattered body,

Then came noise and is shaking
And each bone came to its bone,
Sinew, flesh and skin came upon on it
But it had no life of its own,

array,
And speaks words of Life

And publishes to every land,
The work of an Almighty hand.

Soon as the evening shades prevail,
The moon takes up the wondrous tale
And nightly to the listening earth,
Repeats the story of her birth;
While all the stars that round her burn
And all the planets in their turn
Confirm the tidings as they roll,
And spread the truth from pole to pole.

Verse 3
What though in solemn silence all,
Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
What though no real voice nor sound,
Amid their radiant orbs be found;
In reason's ear they all rejoice
And utter forth a glorious voice;
Forever singing as they shine,
The hand that made us is divine."

The water of life gave me
Strength to go on,
He opened my eyes,
Turned the darkness to dawn;
And now there is sunshine
And love in my heart;
Something inside me is singing,
The thirst in my soul
Now is quenched everyday;
As I drink at the well of His mercy.

Now, if you are thirsty,
Come drink at this well;
You will never thirst again,
Like the woman at the well
Jesus spoke to that day
Said, ""Come drink at the well of mercy.""

Get on board my friend x 2

If you look around you will see the signs
Flashing red lights of His coming everywhere
Pretty faces painted faces
Naked women on the streets everywhere
Men and women multiplying, as it was
In the days of Noah everywhere

Denominations rejecting Jesus
Preaching creeds and men
Allowing women to preach in churches
To cut their hair and to paint their faces
Wearing trousers..oh what a shame

Throw away your bag of gossip
Pay your debts and clean your life
Pack your suitcase of the Word and let us go"

And here we are in the second-fold of a three-fold mystery
Part being spoken by the Son of man

highway begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he
could not see;
He clutched his rags and shivered
in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and bade his
darkness flee.

CHORUS
When Jesus comes the tempter's
power is broken;
When Jesus comes, the tears
are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the
life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus
comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil
spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
He cut himself as demon pow'rs
possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the
captive free.

Unclean! unclean! The leper cried
in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness
stood near;
The fever raged, disease had gripped
its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast
out every fear.

So men today have found the
Saviour able,
They could not conquer passion,
lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them sad
and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt
Himself within."

That fountain in his day;
And there may I,
though vile as he,
{Wash all my sins away,} X3

though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Thou dying Lamb,
Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God

Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

E've since by faith
I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,

Redeeming love

And shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler,
sweeter song,

stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave."

Waiting for the redemption of this body;

It's a fact that I can't rest until I'm perfect.

Before the Masterpiece could speak it must be smitten
By the determinate counsel of our God,
What shall I say then, 'Father take this cup from me?'

To fulfill what is written of us."

But I'm filled with the Spirit,
There isn't a doubt,
And thats what's the matter with me.

This is my Father's world,

Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
His hand the wonders wrought.

Verse 2
This is my Father's world;
The birds their carols raise.
The morning light, the lily white,
Declare their Maker's praise;
This is my Father's world;
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass,
He speaks to me everywhere.

Verse 3
This is my Father's world,
O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the Ruler yet.

And earth and heaven be one."

I want more of You
No matter the price
Total separation Lord
Not my will but Thine;

Chorus
Take me up those seven steps
Till in Your image
I stand
Take me up those seven steps
Till in Your image I stand.

Verse 2
Thresh the chaff around my life
So I'll be a pure grain
With no hidden sin deep within
To hinder You from coming in;

Verse 2
All I want is You my Lord
So please empty me I pray
Because I know the more I empty out
Is the more that You can fill.

When I shall find the time;
All I'm getting lately is
Living on my mind.

Somebody told me;
That I should find
A new place to live;
But you know;

Do me  by living on my mind."

2320;This World Is Not My Home;;"Verse 1
This world is not my home
I'm just a'passing through
My treasures are laid up
Somewhere beyond the blue.
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

CHORUS
Oh Lord you know,
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Verse 2
They're all expecting me
And that's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus
Many years ago.
I know He'll see me through
Tho' I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Verse 3
Just over in the gloryland,
We'll live eternally;
The saints on every hand
Are shouting ""victory"".
The songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore."

Thou art worthy
Thou art worthy Oh Lord.

And for Thy pleasure,
They are created.
Thou art worthy Oh Lord."
2322;Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne;;"Chorus 1
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus.
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Chorus 2
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest for me.

Verse 1
Thou didst leave Thy throne
And Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me.
But in Bethlehem's home
Was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity.

Verse 2
Heaven's arches rang,
When the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal decree;
But of lowly birth,
Didst Thou come to earth
And in great humility.

Verse 3
The foxes found rest
And the birds their nest,
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod,
O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee.

Verse 4
Thou camest, O Lord,
With the living word,
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn
And with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary.

Verse 5
When the heaven's shall ring
And the angels sing,
At Thy coming to victory;
Let Thy voice call me home,
Saying, ""Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee."""
2323;Though We Are Tested;;"Verse 1
We walk by faith and not by sight
Our eyes look to the unseen
The Lord Jesus Christ
For He has promised

Verse 1
That we will reign with him
But the pathway to glory is through suffering
So count it all joy when you fall in divers temptations
For it's only to bring you to that perfect place

CHORUS
Though we are tested and we are tried
Yet in the midst of it all
We can have peace of mind

Chorus
For the trying of our faith worketh patience
For in my lowest valley He restoreth my soul
He gives me strength to keep pressing on

Verse 2
Sometimes we pray oh Lord please take our lives
We just can't go on we don't know what to do
But in that hour we found a Juniper  tree

Verse 2
Where the Angel comes to strengthen for the journey ahead
For in our weakness His strength is made perfect
And His Grace is sufficient for us

Bridge
When I'm down in the valley,
(Give me strength)
In the midst of my trials,
(Give me strength)
So I'm pressing on,
Give me strength to keep pressing on."
2324;Through It All;;"I've had many tears and sorrows,
I've had questions for tomorrow,
Many times I didn't know right from wrong;
But in every situation,
God gave me blessed consolation,
That my trials only come to make me strong.

CHORUS
Through it all, through it all,
I've learned to trust in Jesus,
I've learned to trust in God;
Through it all, through it all,
I've learned to depend upon His Word.

I've been a lot of places,
And I've seen millions of faces,
But there were times I felt so all alone;
But in my lonely hours,
Those precious lonely hours,
Jesus let me know that I am His own.

So I thank God for the mountains,
And I thank Him for the valleys,
And I thank Him for the storms He brought me through;
For if I never had a problem,
How could I know that my God would solve them;
How could I know what faith in God
can do."
2325;Through My Tears;;"Years I lived for a long time
Saw no need to have a Savior
Hopelessly wondered on in dread and fear
And then one day I saw the cross
And I cried to God for mercy
He forgave and rescued me through my tears

Chorus
Through my tears, I met the Savior
Through my tears, I saw the Light
Through my tears I see
Heaven's gates unfolding to that land
Where there'll be no more tears

All Alone and on my knees
To the word I pray in earnest
Why the skies should seem so dark and oh so dreary
Then comes the dawn
And I behold His loving face still watching over me
I see it all, as He had planned through my tears"
2326;Through The Blood;;"Through the blood

Across the dark wave,
There is a brother
Whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother!
Oh, who then will dare
To throw out the Life-Line,
His peril to share?

Chorus
Throw out the Life-Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is drifting away!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is sinking today.

Throw out the Life-Line
With hand quick and strong;
Why do you tarry,
Why linger so long?
See! he is sinking;
Oh hasten today
And out with the Life-Boat!
Away, then, away!

Throw out the Life-Line
To danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish
Where you've never been;
Winds of temptation
And billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out
Where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season
Of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift
To eternity's shore;
Haste then,my brother,
No time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line
And save them today."

My lips shall praise Thee
Thus will I bless Thee while I live

Shut up from the way to God
Not knowing how to find its way
Sinful and fallen man, in need of redemption
Who would atone, who could pay
Though the blood of bulls and goats were shed
It could not atone, the price to fully pay
It would take the blood of a holy one
But none was found worthy who could pay

CHORUS
Till Jesus came
The sinless, spotless Lamb of God
The holy one, the living word came down that day
Yes Jesus came
Conquering death, defeating sin
Opening the way back to enter in to God that day
When he came
When Jesus came.

Burdened and steeped in sin
No peace, no joy within
Condemned by guilt, filled with shame
Dwelling in the outer court
Wondering who could pay the cost
To free me from this bondage and chains
Though I searched and cried, there was no one
Who could redeem me and for my sin atone
Till a priest did point to Calvary's cross
And the price God did to ransom back His own

When Jesus came
Conquering death, defeating sin
Renting the veil so, we could enter in to God again
Yes Jesus came
Paying the price on Calvary
Fully atoning to set man free
From guilt and shame
When He came
When Jesus came.

When Jesus came
What a wondrous work he wrought for us that day
Removing the guilt and taking all our sin away
When He came  --- Praise His name
When He came ---Triumphing over sin
When He came--- Opening the way so we could enter in
When He came, When He came
When Jesus came!!"
2342;Time Is Near;;"Jesus said there is a mansion
That he has prepared for me
And I'm tired of this old pest house,
I'm longing for my new body,
And deep within I can hear His voice
Beckoning me to that place
I see end time signs all around
And I know soon I'll see His sweet face.

CHORUS
The time is near can't you hear
Your Savior calling you to a land
Where we'll never grow old
So don't you bow, don't give in
Cause in a little while we'll be going home.

Now through the Word I am seeing
That before the world began
I was chosen to be His bride
I was always a part of His plan
And even though this world is dying
I will never be afraid
Cause in the twinkling of an eye,
I'll take my flight through the sky,
To live eternally with my King.

In a little while we'll be with the Father
Can't you see Him smile?
In a little while we'll be home forever            (2X)
In a while
Saints you must keep pressing on
And we'll be home in just a little while.

Cause in a little while
We'll be going home
(In a little while we'll be with the Father)
We'll be going home
(In a little while we'll be with the Father)
We'll be going home where there's no more crying, no more dying
(We'll be going home.)
Where there's no more killing,
No more fighting
(We'll be going home)
Where there's no more sickness,
No more sorrow, no more pain,
No more tomorrow
(We'll be going home)
Don't you bow, don't give in
Cause in a while we'll be with our King
Don't you want to go to that place
Where we'll never grow old?

When I think about what God has done
Back there on Calvary;
Even Seven Angels coming in a Cloud
Bringing back
redemption for me;

verse 1
Opening up the
Lamb's book of Life
And all the hidden mysteries,
And I know that we have eaten the Book,
What a people we should be!

Verse1
And when I see another corn of  wheat
Coming to a mature stage,
And this is the day of redemption
And the price has been paid;

verse 1
Yet I see the things You've promised
Missing in my life,
Oh how I want to lose my life,
{So your Life could be
wrapped up in mine}x2

CHORUS
For I'm tired living underprivileged
When I see
what God has done;
I'm tired living as a servant
When it's time
for manifested sons.

CHORUS
Lord, You gave revival
And You promised the Third Pull too;
{For the greater works
we have to do}x2

Verse 2
There are souls
under the altar,
They are crying out 'how long Lord?'
Sleeping saints,
They are anxiously
Awaiting on the resurrection.

verse 2
In my heart there is a cry
To go back to that place,
No more darkly in a mirror,
But seeing face to face.
The whole creation is groaning,
Waiting on that sweet release;

Verse2
The lion wants to lay
down with the lamb
For a thousand years of peace;
And I want to see the One
Who has been
with us all the time;
But still I want to lose my life
{So His Life could be
wrapped up in mine. }X2

Verse3
A new day has dawned
And I just can't go on this way,
Just saying that I'm a Christian,
Walking with my Bible everyday,

verse 3
The Prophet said
the true church would write
Another Book of Acts,
And if I don't come back to that place
Then I have missed the mark.

verse 3
But between revivals the locks have grown,
There is a possibility;
The meal has been placed upon the sticks
To be baked into reality,
Faith to use the power
Is growing greater all the time.

verse 3
So like Samson:
""Just once more Lord"",
Like Esther:
""If I perish I perish Lord"",
Like Jonah:
""To do Your bidding Lord"",
Like Joseph:""to be a prisoner"";

Now's my time for consecration,
I must see a change in me,
I will enter my secret closet,

Deep in my soul,
Change me from glory unto glory,
Till Thy image You behold.

Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear,
only trust and obey."

When your heart is breaking
God knows how to make you smile
When you feel you cannot take one step more
Trust Him, He will not fail you
Trust Him because He loves you

He loved us so much that He went to calvary
He took our place upon the cross
So forever we'll be free
Lift up your head towards the Christ
For there is victory
Trust Him.. He will not fail you
Trust Him because He loves you

You know, it's not the plan of God
That you should feel so bad
It's His will to touch you and make your heart glad
Maybe in all of your life
It's never been this bad
Trust Him, He will not fail you
Trust Him because He loves you"

The light of God's revealed Word flashed across our hearts
And we have been made whole.
Now we walk in the light as He is in the light,
Having fellowship one with the    other,
God's blood that cleanses and His love that conquers.

CHORUS
There's a man here that can turn on the light,
There's a man here that can turn on the light,
So If you're in darkness, cannot find your way,
There's a man here that can show you the way.

In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God,
And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,
The light of God's revealed Word
Face to face we see now,
Almighty God unveiled before us,
The Lamb that was slain, who took the Book
And showed us our names.

King Theophany Jesus that is walking in and amongst us,
God En Morphe for the final turn at the west.
So when you look, what do you see now?
It depends on what you're looking
for,
We are a people that have been set free,
Living epistles that can show you the door."
2389;Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus;;"O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free!

CHORUS
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion,
For more than conqu'rors we are!

His Word shall not fail you,
He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well;
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!"

'Twas a glad day when Jesus found me.
When His strong arms were thrown around me,
When my sins He buried in the deepest sea,
And my soul He filled with joy and victory.
'Twas a glad day, O hallelujah.
'Twas a glad day He claimed His own.
I will shout a glad hosanna in glory,
When I see Him upon His throne.

Verse 1
I was lost in sin when Jesus found me.
But He rescued me, all glory to His name.
And the cords of worldly pleasure bound me,
'Til He saved me from sin and shame.

For I hear their tones within my ransomed soul.
And my heart is filled with joyful singing,
Since the Savior hath made me whole.

In the mansions of my Father's home above.

CHORUS
Two thousand years ago
And today He's still the same
It thrills a soul inside of me
each time I hear His name
If I had to pay for all my sins
Oh what a debt I owed
But Jesus paid it all for me
Two thousand years ago


It's a lovely life since He came in
and took control of me
I will praise the name of Jesus
Throughout eternity
The world may think I'm fooling
But Oh I love Him so
Because of what He did for me
Two thousand years ago"

Undefiled real pure lives
Walking Holy and upright
Keep the flag flying high
By living clean and undefiled

And when we walk down

All the people that we meet
Will see we can't be sold

We are worth much more

When temptations fall on us
Lets turn and run from evil snares
For our bodies are the temple of the Lord

It seems like our species fast becoming extinct
Survival in earth's atmosphere gets harder every day
But the same God who saved my soul
Is more than able to keep us whole
And present us before Christ undefiled."

Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

Under His wings,
What a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly
Turns to His rest!
Often when earth has
No balm for my healing,
There I find comfort,
And there I am blest.

Under His wings,
O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till
Life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected,
No evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus
I'm safe evermore."

Keep me, Savior, from day to day,
Under the precious blood.

The sinner's refuge here alone,
Under the blood, under the blood;
Here Jesus makes salvation known,
Under the precious blood.

Lord, with Thy self my spirit fill,
Under the blood, under the blood;
And work in me to do Thy will,
Under the precious blood.

Sweet peace abides within the heart,
Under the blood ,under the blood;
And gifts divine their joy impart,

Exerts His sanctifying power,

When I pause to remember,
A heartache here

Is not my final home.

CHORUS
But until then,
My heart will go on singing,
Until then,
With joy I'll carry on.
Until the day
Mine eyes behold the city
Until the day
God calls me home.

The things of earth
Will dim and lose their value,
If we recall,
They're borrowed for awhile
And things of earth
That cause the heart to tremble
Remember there,
Will only bring a smile.

When it's released
It's destined for the sky."

Unworthy, I'm so unworthy
Of such love and mercy
The price You paid on Calvary
Who am I that He should die for me
This wretched man, that I am
He sacrificed Himself to set me free

I didn't see His nail scarred hands
As He was stripped and in pain
But on the Cross, not once did He
Think about His shame
As His Blood flowed from that Tree
All He thought about was you and me
Isn't that love, tell me, isn't that love

Praise the Lamb that was slain
He went up, but soon, He'll come again

Met the giant on the field all alone;

thrice each day,
Then unto the lion's den led the way;
Trusting in the Lord,
He did not fear or dread,
By faith he saw the victory ahead.

Often with the carnal mind I was tried,
Asking for deliverance oft I cried;
Trusting in the Lord,
I reckoned I was dead,
By faith I saw the victory ahead.

By faith I see the victory ahead."

How He gave His life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me;

Of His precious Blood's atoning,
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory.

Chorus
Oh victory in Jesus
My Saviour, forever
He sought me and bought me;
With His redeeming blood;

Chorus
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood.

Verse 2
I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see;

Verse 2
And then I cried, ""Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit,""
And somehow Jesus came and brought
To me the victory

Verse 3
I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea;

About the Angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there
The song of victory."

To overcome the world and it's evil

May the Light of His glorious gospel illuminate our lives
For a sacred responsibility
Has been entrusted to us
To get home the King's message
To those who are part of Him

In a silent night you do wonder,
Seeing your life as a blunder;

You really witness time ticking;
And you look at your weary life,
Loaded with trouble and strife;

And you wonder, this is strange;
Where is God? Does He love me?
Yes He does, just wait & see;

He will never love you like a father;
When he sees chocolates ahead,
Before the blessing he wants you dead;
But keep the faith, wait a little more

Some waited till they went astray;
Waiting is never fascinating,
But there's power in waiting;
Wait just a little more

Satan is an enemy of progress,
He can't sit back and see you progress;
He fights you in every way,
But keep the faith all the way;
Wait just a little more

On His time, He is never behind,
He has a husband for you,
He has a wife in store for you;
Wait just a little more

He has healing for every disease,
From pain to a soothing breeze;
Christianity has no bad luck,
You're the seed not the shuck;
Wait just a little more

Mind your lips, your words;
Don't put faith and trust on the shelf,
Speak the right words about yourself;

The load is heavy and the road is long
It's so hard to be strong,
But what you're longing for
Might be around the bend;
Don't give in.

There is a voice that speaks inside me;
It says there's someone walking right
Beside me- He's always there to help
And guide me- Showing me how
To walk on."

Just take a look behind you and

And everytime you asked me,

I searched until I found you and

She said my bills are coming due

She hears a voice so still and

It says I

Didn't I put food on your table
Showed up when your bills were
due
When the pains were racking
your body, Didn't I send healing

When you were lost in sin and
sorrow, I died to set you free
So you would know just how
much I love you"

In the town of Bethlehem
God came down and visit man,
Oh wasn't that love, Oh that was
Wasn't that love;

Verse 1
He knew pain and loneliness
As He wore that robe of flesh,
Wasn't that love
Oh wasn't that love.

Verse 2
Wasn't that love
How He left His home above
To die on Calvary
Just to save a wretch like me,
And everday i kneel in prayer
There's only one thing left to say,
Oh wasn't that love.

Verse 3
As He stood in Pilate's Hall,
He never said a word at all,
Oh wasn't that love, Oh that was

You can rise today

2458;Wasted Opportunities;;"To think that men lived in a day
When the word of God was made flesh and dwelt on the earth;
But when the promise of the Holy Ghost was given,
Only a few were prepared to receive it in their souls;
There were others, a great multitude,
But the precious seed that was
sown, from their hearts Satan stole.

CHORUS
There are so many wasted opportunities,
Life has a way to get you relaxed and set you on your ease;
There are so many wasted opportunities,
People going after temporary needs which are only lying vanities.

History always repeats itself, this we all know,
For as it was, so shall it be,
The Bible tells us so.
The greatest event started with a shout,
But the veil was upon the hearts of many so they could not
For the form of flesh God took to reveal Deity many could not
So they stumbled at simplicity.

There was promised a second ride to catch away God's bride,
We were told to learn our A,B,C's,
And live humble and right in God's sight;
But as was promised the Lord did come as a thief in the night,
But only who have ears to hear and eyes to see saw Him en
morphe."
2459;Watching You;;"All along on the road to the
souls true abode,
There's an Eye watching you;
Every step that you take,
this great Eye is awake,
There's an Eye watching you.

CHORUS
Watching you, watching you,
Everyday mind the
course you pursue;
Watching you, watching you,
There's an all-seeing
Eye watching you.

As you make life's great
flight,
keep the pathway of right,
There's an Eye watching  you;
God will warn not to go in
the path of the foe,
There's an Eye watching  you.

Fix your mind on the goal,
that sweet home of the soul,
There's an Eye watching you;
Never turn from the way
to the kingdom of day,
There's an Eye watching you.

If you steal and cheat and lie
And in the church you testify
There's an Eye, watching you
Every step that you take this
Great eye is awake
There's an Eye watching you"

2466;We Are Free;;"Through the seven ages of the church,
Like servants unto man,
Enslaved by vain traditions,
And a world of self-made plans,
Would we ever be made free,
Be granted liberty,
Or be forced to serve the systems round about us?
But the Bible tells about
A seventh year release,
Where the masters free their servants
If they choose to be set free,
And at the dawning of the day
They could go in their way
Or take the mark of bondage ever to be a slave.

BRIDGE

Freedom or bondage,
What would you choose today?
A free man forever,
Or a servant to the grave?
You can have a life anew,
I know God will see you through,
He is calling a bride unto Himself.

CHORUS
And we are free,
From the chains of any man,
We are free,
And freely we can stand
Before the world and its religions,
And boldly testify, that we are bought with a price.
His blood has our sacrifice,
That makes us free for the marriage unto Him.
We are free,
Purged and born again,
So rejoice that in our day, the price for freedom has been paid.
Who the Son has set free
Is free indeed.

Our name is something different now,
Our life is not our own,
We're united with Jesus Christ,
And Jesus Christ alone,
And there's no man can take His place,
There's no church we'll have to face,
Because the voice of God is speaking now through us.

And we are free
Like the eagles in the sky
We are free,
So spread your wings and fly,
Don't look back, don't turn around,
To Christ we're Heaven bound,
Who the Son has set free is free indeed.

Don't  look back, don't turn around
To Christ we're Heaven bound,
Who the Son has set free
Is free indeed.
Who the Son has set free
Is free indeed."

We shall see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming
We are looking to the skies;

We'll keep our eyes
On the prize

And in a world that's cold and dark
He's holding to our hands
And though sometimes
Every thing seems wrong
We know God has a plan

Here we stand

But with our compass set on the North Star
We'll reach the shores of Eternity.

Contrary winds of doctrine blew against us on the way,
But we set  our eye on the Captain,
Listened to what He had to say.
Many ships were tossed to and fro
And were driven off their course,
But we are thankful to our Captain,
We aren't shipwrecked, we aren't lost.

To see the glory of the Lord you
must stand still.}X2

We are sailing through many rough waters,
Using our paddles skillfully,
Now we are faced with treacherous
conditions,
We need the Master of the sea
To say ""Peace be still.""
To see your troubles end, you must stand still;
He'll say, ""Peace be still.""
To see the glory of the Lord you must stand still.

Upon the distant shore, there's a land that's shining bright;
Soon we'll reach that golden shore
And be welcomed by the Prince of Light.
He'll say, ""Peace be still,
My light has led you to do My perfect will.""
He'll say, ""Peace be still,""
And when we see Him face to face
We must stand still."

When the breakers have told that the reef is

Thought the tempest rave and the wild winds

Not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.

When the waters cold chill our latest breath ,
On the rising tide it will never fail ,
While our hopes within the Veil.

We shall anchor fast by the heav'nly shore ,
With storms all past forevermore.

2498;We Need A Revival (poem);;"We depart from our position;
We abandon supplication;
We neglect confession;

We become a fallen nation;
In a backsliden condition:
A state of ruination.

Worship cold and formal;
Services less Word, more world;
Church now a Picnic;

People, for their fallen state no panic;
Revival fires put off;
The flaming coals of godly zeal shoved off.

Blessed art those who mourn;
For the sins of the city and our own;
For wickedness among the saints do sigh;

God watches such with His eye;
Who prays not for themselves only;
But for a revival showers pure and holy.

Rivers with crocodiles we used to cross;
On our way to service, soldiers of the Cross;
Brotherly kindness in reality not a joke;

Happily loving one another, carrying each other's yoke;
But bit by bit our bones did weaken;
On the original zeal we did slacken

Youths of today, church of tomorrow;
If cold now what a generation to follow,
More and more play and less and less pray;

Time for visions substituted for televisions;
Friendship with a world falling apart,
Tearing our blessed testimony apart!

Lord send us the rain,
Our lost qualities to regain;
Our hearts to reboot the importance,

Of uncompromising repentance;
A revival of purity, confessions true and complete;
Till in His likeness the Church stands complete!

Seven seals have been revealed

I will meet you on that
beautiful shore

Oh they say we will meet
by that river
Where no storm clouds
ever darkened the skies,
and they say we will be happy
in heaven
In that wonderful sweet by and by

If we never meet again this side
of heaven
as we struggle through this world
and its strife
There is another meeting place
somewhere in heaven
By the side of the river of life

Where the charming roses bloom forever

My home is for the pure,
The vile can never stay,

To crown your Savior King and Lord of all?

The ground was tilled, the seed was sown,
And it was ripened by the Son
Now it's harvest time, let's work together for what must be done
Standing in unity, standing in love.

Just like Moses, when he led the children to the Promised Land,
The cloud led by day, the pillar of fire by night
As they marched as one from Egypt's land
And when this bride is perfected, we will all meet in the new
We'll be standing in unity, we'll be standing as one.

That the world may know, God sent his Son
Father make us one.

Star with royal beauty bright;
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to Thy perfect light.

We three kings of Orient are,
Bearing gifts we traverse afar;
Field and fountain moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.

Verse 2
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again;
King forever, ceasing never,
Over us all to reign.

Verse 3
Frankincense to offer have I,
Incense owns a Deity nigh;
Prayer and praising, all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.

Verse 4
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume,
Breathes a life of gathering gloom;
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.

Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and sacrifice;
Alleluia, alleluia!
Earth to heav'n replies."

We too have a theophany
A body waiting in the heavens
for me, we cannot wait to see how
eternity will be

Daddy is the token applied for me
Does the Spirit abide in me
I want to know for sure

Mummy how are we so sure
Is it because we believe the prophet Malachi 4
The token is on the door
We are safe forever more

Now we know we have a part to play
To obey all that the prophet say
The token is a promise to them that obey,

Friends it don't matter if you're big or small
Little stones are part of the building wall
Believe in God today and you will find your way

Spoken by the our prophet of God}2x

The time has come we shall die
Caiphas has set plans into action
Now you shall see your God glorify

Are you willing to give your life

Who will stand, when the valleys go lower?

He who'll overcome,
(For we are born of the Lord,)
He who'll watch and pray
(For we are born of the Lord,)
Mix the word with faith,
(For we are born of the Lord.)

Millions of unclean spirits are roaming the earth
With issues in their mouths,
Searching for a place,
An inhabitant to dwell,
To spit those issues out;
But like Joseph who knew that famine will come,
Prepared, so the people won't die,
God sent Elisha with the hidden manna,
Food He had stored for a bride,
A bride who will stand

For the covenanted people
God sent regulations,
What we should and should not eat;
No Devil can beguile us,
No serpent can defile us,
We'll remain healthy and clean
And every storm brings us closer,
It anchors our soul to that rock;
God will never leave us,
But He must chastise us
To prove we are born of the word.
And we'll stand

We'll talk it over
My Lord and I
I'll ask the reason,
He'll tell me why
Whe we talk it over
In the by and by.

He'll never fail
Through darkness tunnels
Or misty veil
Obey His bidding
And faithful be
Though only one step
Ahead I see."

Yet in the midst Lord I can stand and testify of Your goodness
For I have found my strength in You
To overcome every test

My footsteps are ordained by You
And though I may suffer for a while
Yet in the end Your name is glorified

CHORUS
For there's nothing going wrong in my life
When trials seem to come my way
For your word has promised me victory
As long as I'm abiding in You
For the sufferings of this present time is not worthy to be
With the glory of God that shall be seen in me
So Father glorify Your name

So I will count it all joy
When I am tested and tried
For God has a purpose
It just His way to us He proves of His love and care for us
So in the midst we ought to thank Him
For He has promised us perfection
He has given us the victory
For we are made more than conquerors
His chosen that shall reign with Him

On flow'ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?

To help me on to God.

Increase my courage, Lord;
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain.
Supported by Thy Word."

To them that belived and heard

Like desert phantoms lure,
And they that drink,the fainter grow,
The keener thirst endure.

To bless and cleanse and heal,
And he that drinketh, Jesus said,
New life and rest shall feel.

Take the dearest thing to me,
If that's how it must be,
To draw me closer to Thee;
Let the disappointments come,
Lonely days without the sun,
If in sorrow, more like You I'll become.

Take my dreams and my plans,
For I'm placing my whole life in Your
And if You'll call me today to a land far
Then I'll go and Your will obey."

While on this way

Never leave me lying cold and chill;
And I'll enter to live up there forever

On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all."

But I decided to keep on calling
I'm so glad that, Jesus knows.

Chorus
When it rains it pours!
Storm clouds rise, Billows roar
Just seek Jesus. He'll bring sunshine

All because of what someone has told
They won't believe in you, Nomatter what you do

When deep down in your heart; you know

Oft we toil amid the shadows,
And our fields are far apart:

Over on the streets of gold,
When the redeemed are gathering in;

O'er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption's story
With their voices clear and strong,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Then the angels all will listen,
For they cannot join that song,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

To prepare the banquet board,

In the shadow of his hand

All His chastenings will come.

Enemies may strive to injure

Into everlasting joy.

Meeting storms and billows wild

Naught can harm His father's child"

we see Jesus;
Life's trials will seem so small,
when we see Christ;
One glimpse of His dear face,
all sorrow will erase,
So bravely run the race till
we see Christ.

Sometimes the sky looks dark,
with not a ray of light;
We're tossed and driven on,
no human help in sight;
But there is One in heaven,
who knows our deepest
care,
Let Jesus solve your problem,
just go to Him in prayer

Life's day will soon be o'er,
all storms forever past;
We'll cross the great divide,
to glory safe at last;
We'll share the joys of heaven,
a harp, a home, a crown;
The tempter will be banished,
we'll lay our burden down."

Seeking a refuge
for my soul
Needing a friend to
help me in the end,
Where could I go but
to the Lord?

Neighbours are kind, I
love them every one,
We get along in sweet
accord;
But when my soul needs
manna from above,
Where could I go but to
the Lord?

Life here is grand with
friends I love so dear,
Comfort I get from God's
own Word;
Yet when I face the
chilling hand of death,
Where could I go but to
the Lord?"

By an eagle prophet's message
To manifest the living word for our day we have been given wings to fly way up in  the sky
Where no other bird can fly
To live in a heavenly atmosphere
To fly where only eagles dare

CHORUS
Let's fly so high
Where the Word of God is a living reality
To soar so high, true eagles in the sky
Set your wings let's fly
Where eagles dare

We have been gathered by the shout
A message that called us out
From this world of fear and doubt
And have been given eyes to see
All the mysteries are being revealed
Our lives are fulfilling prophecy
To see our position in God's word
To fly where only eagles could

We are not called to be earthbound
Amidst the chipmunks on the ground
Neither be living up and down
But quickened, changed, lifted up upon the mountain top
Setting in the cleft of the rock
Gathered where the carcass is
The place where eagles live"
2591;Where He Leads Me;;"Sweet are the promises,
kind is the word;

Follow all the way;

Jesus hath shown,
Sweeter far than any love
that mortals have known;
Kind to the erring one,
faithful is He;
He the great example is
and pattern for me

List to His loving words,
""Come unto Me!""
Weary, heavy laden,
there is sweet rest for thee;
Trust in His promises,
faithful and sure;
Lean upon the Savior,
and thy soul is secure."

with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him
through the garden,
I'll go with Him
through the garden,
I'll go with Him
through the garden,
I'll go with Him,
with Him all the way.

I'll go with Him
through the judgment,
I'll go with Him
through the judgment,
I'll go with Him
through the judgment,
I'll go with Him,
with Him all the way.

grace and glory,
He will give me
grace and glory,

with me all the way."

2594;Where There's A Deep;;"We see the tree in the winter,
The green leaves are turned brown and red,
The life that was there has gone back to the ground,
It looks like the tree is dead.
There is a promise of springtime,
That life will be made anew;
It speaks of the resurrection morning,
It shows that God's Word  is true,

CHORUS
Where there's a deep, deep calling,
There's a deep, deep to respond
Where there's a hope for a city,
There's a land beyond the sun,
Where there's a yearning, burning, to leave this world  we have
There is a King returning, coming to take us home.

Each one must come to his winter,
And God all His children has saved,
That though they may lay us beneath the cold ground,
The life that was there is not dead,
We have a promise of springtime,
That life would be made anew,
We'll meet at the resurrection morning,
We'll sail beyond the blue.

God's seed had to die and be buried,
In Luther it started to sprout,
The work had begun, drawn forth by the sun,
The message of faith brought it out,
Then came the stalk by John Wesley,
The Holy Ghost made the wheat grow,
Then the chaff and the wheat separated,
God's seventh angel Word made it so."

And on the earth be peace;
Good will hence forth from heaven to men
Begin and never cease."""

To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God;
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Thou I've wandered far from His fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than the snow!
Whiter than the snow!
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that Fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow."
2601;Who Am I;;"When I think of how He came so far from glory,
Came to dwell amongst the lowly such as I,
To suffer shame and such disgrace,
On Mt. Calvary take my place,
Then I ask myself the question,
Who am I?

CHORUS
Who am I that a king would bleed and die for?
Who am I that He would pray ""not my will but thine Lord?""
The answer I may never know,
Why He ever loved me so,
But to an old rugged cross to go,
Who am I?

When I'm reminded of His Word,
'I'll leave thee never,
Just be true, I'll give to you a life forever,'
I wonder what I could have done,
To deserve God's only Son
To fight my battles till they're won,
Who am I?"

For reapers to work for the Lord,
The harvest is ripe but the labourers are few,

For there's much work to be done,
The kingdom of God is at hand
And I will glorify my Lord.

Your servant Lord, Nehemiah,
He laboured to rebuild the wall,
Sanbalat and Tobiah are trying to hinder Your cause,
Hear the prays of the saints, oh God,
To see the Lord's true worship restored;
The hornets have gone before us,
And the gospel must be preached.

Surely the land we've trodden under-foot
Will be our inheritance,
Be not afraid of giants no, no, no,
When we serve the Living God;
So who's this uncircumcised philistine from whom should such a

To gain by a further delay?

His Spirit now striving within?

You know so many years ago
He left His home up in Glory
to die upon the lonely cross of Calvary
and though all eternal ages.


He never turned back the pages
to the life that I had lived
before He rescued me.
When I cried Jesus I

in that home beyond the sun
but I am so weak in myself

take my hand for too long

When the clouds unfold their wings of strife

Will your anchor drift, or firm remain

CHORUS
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love

Will your anchor hold in the straits of fear
When the breakers roar and the reef is near
While the surges rave and the wild winds blow
Shall the angry waves then your bank overflow

Will your anchor hold in the floods of death
When the waters cold chill your latest breath
On the rising tide you can never fail
While your anchor holds, within the veil

Will your eyes behold through the morning light
The City of Gold and the harbour bright
Will you anchor safe by the heavenly shore
Will life's storms are past forever more"

In a manger of hay;

In many a way,
I cried for healing

By night and by day,

To that city of peace,
Where the author of peace
I shall see,
That one strain of the song
Which the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom shall be:

Without comfort or rest,
Marching down the rough

Go at His command.

So through all life's way He walketh,
Ever near our side.
Soon again shall we behold Him.
Hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be ""this same Jesus,""
As He went away.

Verse 5
He who was the friend of sinners,
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come and at His footstool
Penitently bow.
He who said, ""I'll not condemn thee,
Go and sin no more;""
Speaks to thee that word of pardon,
as in days of yore.

Verse 6
Oft on earth He healed the suff'rer
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue,
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His fullness,
Still will give as much."

2676;Your Cries Have Awoken The Master;;"Verse 1

Crossing the calm sea with Jesus,
The disciples were getting concerned,
The winds started violently blowing,
But He was asleep in the stearn,
Does He not care that we perish?
We're helpless and we're so afraid,
Jesus arose when they called Him,
And said to them where is your faith?

Chorus
Because you've prayed all night,
Cause you've held on with all of your might,
Child your cries have awoken the Master.
Oh He knows your voice,
Lift your hands it's time to rejoice,
Child your cries have awoken the Master.

Verse 2
It hit you without any warning,
The storm of your life had begun,
Seeing no hope in the distance,
You're frightened and nowhere to run,
By now your vessel is filling,
And you're thinking that you'll surely drown,
You cried out for help from the Savior,
And you know you cant give up now...

Bridge
You're up there worried that He's fast asleep,
The wind's are so deadly,
The water's so deep,
But try to be patient,
Cause soon He'll bring peace,
Just one Word from His voice and it all must cease."

All day and night

Your grace and mercy, brought me through
I'm living this moment because of You
I want to thank You, and praise You too
Your grace and mercy, brought me through

Justice demanded, that I should die
But grace and mercy said oh, no, oh, no, oh no,

I once was blind, but thank God I can see
It was because grace and mercy came along and rescued me

You never told me,
That you no longer love me

And to take me someday.

Chorus
I would love to hear,
That story You once told me
That day
Oh tell me that story I love,
Redemption story I love.

This love was confirmed
By the blood that flowed
On Calvary
I'm holding under that,
Waiting for You
To return someday
You have gone up to heaven,
Preparing a home
And to take me away.

I'm Mrs Jesus,
The Bride of Christ,
And He loves me I know
He has promised to marry,
And to keep this Ring
For a wedding day
He has gone up to heaven,
Preparing a home
And to take me someday.

This Ring that He gave
Is the Holy Spirit
For a Token to display,
I'm holding under that
Waiting for Him
To return for me,
He has gone up to heaven
Preparing a home
And to take me someday.

Your last words for me,
You promised me Lord,
To be with me this time,
Now I know that You love me,
I may be grieved
It will soon pass away
You shall come back in the rapture
To take me away;
To be with me forever.
